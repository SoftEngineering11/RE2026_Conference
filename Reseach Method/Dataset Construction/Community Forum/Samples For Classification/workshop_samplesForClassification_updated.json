          "Text": "Hello, In the \"Workshop\" tool it is possible to upload a document as the initial submission. Is it also possible for the reviewer to upload documents in the assessment phase? To clarify my question I will describe what we plan to do: In our course, we want the students to peer-review their essays. We plan to use the \"Workshop\" tool. Instead of writing a feedback statement, we want the students to leave comments directly in the text document. So the workflow would be: Student upload their essay reviewer is assigned by the tool student downloads and reviews the assigned paper student uploads the reviewed paper reviewed essay can be downloaded by the initial author I am unsure if step 4 and 5 are possible with this tool and the moodle tutorials could not really help me to answer these question. Has anyone experience with this or a suggestion for a workaround? Thank you, Melina",

Also, they asked whether it is possible to have the weight of marks for peer reviewers (students) as zero by default, and the teachers to manually add a relevant weight when they do the final grading? They currently use a rubric for their preferred Grading Strategy (in case that makes a difference). Many thanks in advance.",

However, modifying permissions at the activity level requires the teacher to have quite a deep understanding of Moodle. The request here is to make this easier, via adding a setting to Workshop settings page. This would improve the teacher user experience. See MDL-83805",

As it is, the teacher doesn't really know what will happen, and neither do the students in the submit phase. The interface should be very clear about what the anonymity will be, both in the reviewing as in the post-review phase. The interface is complicated by the fact that there are two anonymities involved: that of the author (important in the reviewing phase) and that of the reviewer (important in the conclusion phase). An additional minor feature would be some kind of reminder to the students in the submit phase to not leave identifying information in the submission, depending on the configuration.",

Do you happen to know of any site settings for the Workshop activity that might force the anonymity settings for students by default?

I realise that by making it anonymous by default would mean that those academics who DO want visible peer assessors, would then have to manually change the permissions back (at the activity level).

How is the submission score calculated? If Person A assesses a submission with a score of 50/100, the score is calculated as 50 * 0.8 = 40 points. In other words 80% of 50 = 40 points. If Person B gives a score of 75/100, the score would be 60 points. If those are the only two scores, the average is 50 points, resulting in a submission score of 50/80. That's the simple answer. Weighting of individual scores adds another element, but I won't go into it unless you'd like to hear about it. How is the assessment score calculated? This is how well (accurate and fair) the student assessed a given submission. How is this determined, you may ask. If a student’s grading is very close to the group average, they get a higher assessment grade. If their grading is very different, their assessment grade is lower. The teacher can then adjust how strictly this can be enforced via the Comparison of Assessments dropdown menu (very lax - very strict). The total score for this is 20 by default. That's the simple answer. Once again, weighting and overriding of scores are additional factors.",

As a possible workaround, I have used the following procedure: Create a \"Student folder\" activity, setting Required Teacher approval and Automatic Student approval in \"Publication settings\". Setup the Workshop activity to accept only \"online text\" in the submission types. Instruct students to submit work on the student folder, copy the link to their submission there, and paste it as their submission on the workshop activity.  They only submit text (the link) on the workshop. When submission phase ends, press the \"Give approval\" button on the Student folder activity, to publish all submissions.  This makes them accessible to all students.  Also, move the Workshop to Assessment phase. On the workshop assessment instructions, tell students to follow the links their peers submitted in order to download their work. Then assess as usual. The student folder activity is similar to assignment activity, but also allows publishing of the submissions to all users.  Unlike workshop It allows downloading all submissions easily. This scheme is somewhat complex and this will lead to misinterpretation and human error.  A few students will submit on the student folder and forget to submit on the workshop.  Or they'll paste an invalid link, such as as link to a personal cloud folder, on the workshop.

          "Text": "Dear community, first of all, thank you very much for your excellent work and extraordinary educational tool. I have a question about the difference between \"per submission\" and \"per reviewer\" of the random allocation option of Workshop. I have looked for some information, and the potentially closest discussion is in this link: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=216305#p942023 Unfortunately, I have not been able to ask my question there. The thing is that, to my understanding, it should be possible, and not very difficult, to make the random allocator to assign as many reviewers per submission as submissions per reviewer; so, if students that did not submit their work are not allowed to review other submissions, the option X reviews per submission or per reviewer could be ignored. My idea is to generate X (from \"X reviewes per...\") permutations of the submissions (easy with the numpy library, for instance). Then, for each permutation, reviewers are assigned to the submissions according to the generated permutation. Since the number of submissions is equal to the number of reviewers, because just submitters are allowed to review, and permutations are bijective functions, each submission is assigned to one reviewer and each reviewer is associated to one submission. This procedure is repeated for the X-1 remaining permutations. There is still a possibility of assigning the same submission more than once to the same reviewer, or even a submission to its submitter. However, with enough submissions (and thus, reviewers), I think that this is not very probable and the random allocator could replace problematic permutations with new randomly generated ones (within a while loop and a maximum number of draws). In case non-submitters were allowed to review, then this solution should be fixed, but in any case, you could use your current allocator in this case. That is all. I just wanted to share this possibility with you. My apologies in case I had missed any relevant piece of information that makes my solution invalid. Best wishes!",

          "Text": "Hi, I am using the workshop activity for a programming course. It has been great for students to learn from other peers since a simple task can be written in so many ways . But a problem I have faced is that the workshop activity does not accept submissions in .py (python scripts) or .ipynb (ipython notebooks) formats. So the students have to add the .txt extension, submit the file, and then the peer will have to download the file, remove the .txt extension, and then evaluate. Although it is a simple process , it is cumbersome and adds some unedeed complexity that makes them do it wrong.  Is there a way to add more file types/extensions to the submission options? Thanks in advance",

Thanks to the documentation and the forum, I realize I had misunderstood the principle of the accumulate grading system. I wanted to give: 3 points for aspects 1&4 ; 2 points for aspects 2, 3, 5, 6; and 6 points for aspect 7. But I gave the same weight to each aspect. Therefore the marks are not calculated the way I want them to be. I am currently in the grading evaluation phase. I tried modifying my initial assessment form and change the weight of each aspect, but it doesn't seem to work, even when I hit the recalculate button. I reopened the assessment phase but it doesn't change anything either. I have the feeling that only reopening the setup phase would work. But I'm afraid I may erase all the submissions! Do you confirm that it's too late to modify the assessment form, and nothing can be done at this stage? Thank you!",

I see that this has been under discussion since at least 2012. I have found an imperfect but useful workaround, which is to combine a Group Assignment with Workshop, wherein the group secretary submits the written assignment in both elements, one after the other, with the grade given to the group's submission by Workshop participants being manually input by the teacher into the Group Assignment for grading all members of each group. The Workshop submission's grade is left uncategorized, but the peer-assessment grade is categorized and appears in the gradebook. This facilitates giving a grade to each member of the group for their joint assignment, while allowing the members of other groups to grade the joint assignments (taking that option in the Workbook allocation setting). However, it would be much better for Workshop to include this functionality natively. We found a plug-in whose description appears to provide precisely the kind of group functionality we are looking for, but we don´t know if it will be supported in Spanish or work on our university system without a hitch. We are looking into it, but I wonder whether there might be any advice about it. Congratulations in general on this fine piece of educational technology. It has helped us enormously during the pandemic and we will continue to benefit from it long afterwards.",

Many of our students have asked to see how other students assessed the submissions they were assigned to assess. This makes sense to me. We were previously using the Calibrated Peer Review system which gave students a side by side comparison of how all peer reviewers of a text answered the rubric questions. This made it easy for students to compare how they were marking submissions and often cleared up perceptions of unfairness (usually because they'd see they were outnumbered, read the comments from the other peer reviewers and realize they'd missed something). Is there an option to enable this somewhere and I'm missing it?",

There is some kind of bug that re-triggers the running of the allocating task. Have you had this experience? This is not like allocating 4 instead of 3, or 2 instead of three, which is sometimes caused for lack of peers in the group. This is an actual bug that occurs now in every course every week for us.

          "Text": "Hello, I set a workshop to require 100 students to produce questions of  the multichoice-single/multi answer type after being randomly assigned a set of topics selected form a pool of n topics. Each student has to write 8 questions and will review work from 3peers following a grid of criteria and scores (a rubric actually, but provided separately, not as a workshop rubric) Questions are filled into a pre-set excel file, submitted as an a  attached file, and I assume (never done this before...) each will receive 3 attachments to be downloaded for assessment. In the assessment form I initially set this up so that each \"aspect\" corresponds to one question so they are expected to grade every single question separately which will equally weigh into the final grade. What I didn't understand is how workshop calculates the best assessor to compare with to calculate grades for assessment. If the comparison is made on aspect1 for all 100 students this is obviously not going to be fair as the initial topics are randomly selected and they are not comparable. However, having each student three assessors, if the comparison is made between aspect1 of those three assessors only then the comparison is legitimate. I would be grateful if anyone who could please clarify this. Thanks Adriano",

If your REALLY want to show the description during the submission phase, you will need to copy some code from the, case workshop::PHASE_SETUP: and then add it into the case workshop::PHASE_SUBMISSION:. Of course, if you do this, you will need to remember to do it any time there is an update to the Workshop activity plugin. Assuming you are using Moodle 3.7.2+ with Workshop version 2019052000, open the workshop/view.php file. Assuming line 110 is:  case workshop::PHASE_SETUP: Copy lines 111-115 Assuming line 137 is: case workshop::PHASE_SUBMISSION: Paste your copied lines in as 138-142. Save the file and go to submission phase of your activity and you should see the, Description, added right above the, Instructions for submission. NOTE: Doing it this way permanently adds the Description to the Submission phase of EVERY Workshop you have on your whole site. It DOES NOT appear/disappear by changing the checkmark used to display it on the course page.",

I appreciate that we can set this weight manually, in the grading phase. But in our case we have some 300 submissions, and that's a lot of clicks... I also appreciate that the current default of having a weight = 1 for the self-assessment is reasonable. But in some cases, especially when the number of peers is low (we want to use only 1 or 2 peers, + self-assessment), we think it would not be appropriate to give the self-assessment a weight. What do you think, is there an easy way to not have to do 300*3 clicks, or would this be an interesting feature request?",

My idea so far is this way I read on a forum: Here is where I got the excerpt below: I have tried this\nwith an essay question and a PoodLL question in a quiz, and it works. Create\nthe quiz, then in Quiz administration click on Permissions. Scroll down to\nActivity: Quiz and find Grade quizzes manually. Click the + and add Student. In\nmy testing, students were able to see and grade only their own quiz. The\nteacher was able to see and grade them all. Sorry I do not have a solution yet to you 300 clicks issue but perhaps if you share how you are self grading I can write back on what works for us as we are working on ways to do this for the next year.",

Having done a workshop with my class now, I'm eager to understand more about how it works, so that I can explain this to my students. There can be some bizarre behavior, and this erodes the credibility of this system in the students' eyes. I can understand how a \"best\" paper is identified, and this is assigned 100%. I can also understand that the settings of strictness determines how the grades fall from that. Is there a way to understand how this strictness works? I had students grading a number of errors strategy with 10 components (pretty much equal weighting). For those who aligned perfectly with my grading (and I weighted mine higher), they got 100. But if others deviated just a small amount, some of them got zeros. I don't understand how this happens. The documentation is clear on how it assigns 100%. But I don't understand how it assigns a zero - I suppose a theoretical terrible response is one that is completely opposite of how the average is graded. Say I graded a paper with only 1 other student, but I weighed my paper 10 times the weight. It seems that only mine can be assigned a grade of 100, and this student will have a lower grade. If he grades completely opposite from me (as far as determining the binary decision of whether or not an error in the assertion is marked), then I suppose that is a theoretical zero. But How else does the algorithm determine how low to grade this student? There must be a logic of how strictness is tied to the lowest grade possible among the bunch. Can this be described with greater clarity?",

The graphic showing strict through very lax suggests that the assessment for the grade using a lax setting will be zero when the \"difference\" from the best assessment is 80. 80%? On what basis? What number of errors is considered 80% different?  It seems from this that the math needs to determine what the most different is, that is, what is defined as 100% different.

There is no a single formula for this grade. Yet the process is deterministic. Roughly, the grade is \"100 - distance from the referential (best) assessment\" where this distance is calculated in the method assessments_distance() . Maybe you could put actual data for one submission (i.e. how did students assess it) into an spreadsheet (we neither need to know student names nor text of assessment criteria) and attach it here. We could then go through the data in the shield and illustrate how they are worked with to compute the grading grade. Eventually you could see if such an output format is suitable for the purpose so that it could be implemented as an inbuilt-one. Also please know, there are some other methods of calculating this grade available as plugins at https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:workshopeval The \"Participation credit\" has been found much easier to understand and work with in many cases.",

I'm wondering if this variance in the answers is driven by other respondants (and this would explain some of my surprising grades). If variance matters across graders, then if *everyone* (say 20 people) grades a paper in the same way (say the mark 9 of the first 10 number of error criteria bad and the last \"good\"), and one person deviates from this just a little bit, given the small variance, just a little bit of deviation from the \"best grade\" could yield a very high reldelta, and thus a very low grade. This is not, I think, what is described in the description of how grading works, right? It is supposed to measure how far off a standard the grade is (the standard being the closest grade). It is not supposed to be based on how far you are off, but conditional on how far off everyone else was, right? If the accuracy of everyone else, that is, the variance in their responses, affects the grade of a single person apart from determining the \"best grade\", then it would be helpful to describe how the grading works differently from the way it is. This would make grading on grades based on the n of graders a lot, apart from what gets determined as the \"best\" grade (from which to judge the other grades). thanks! Eric",

Over the years I've tried using this activity with my students, and I've found that the grading is just not that good for high school students. If all of the students are lousy graders, and then one student grades well, that student is punished according to the workshop plugin. Since the way workshop grades is cryptic to students... The students all grade based off a rubric and have to provide feedback why they graded the way they did. I ignore the grades that the workshop supplies, and I replace them with a completeness grade - this consists of they grading 5 other papers, and I grade the quality of their comments. I grade the actual assignments myself, and that is the grade they get -- not the one from the workshop. I think the workshop grades are an interesting talking point (why is Lisa's grading too easy, why is Bobby's grading too strict), but there's no way I could justify using them my gradebook. The value for me, is that the students grading is distributed randomly and evenly.  I used to use the forum for this, but I noticed that it was always the same people grading their friends work.  The workshop forces a student to grade a student that they might not normally interact with.

I actually concluded as well that what the teacher really needs to know and have highlighted are cases when peer-reviews do not fully match. If there was a simple value for each submission, something like \"peer-assessment's similarity index\", the teacher could focus on those cases where some reviewer is significantly off the mean, and intervene eventually.",

I set the settings for Example Submissions to \"Examples must be assessed before own submission\" but some students did not complete the example assessment, so they couldn't submit before the deadline, and now they cannot submit at all. Can I change the setting to \"Examples are available after own submission and must be assessed before peer assessment\" without it making all the students who have already completed the example assessment go back and re-do the example assessment before they are allowed to complete the peer assessments they have been assigned? 2. I did a scheduled allocation and did 3 per submission, not realizing this would just make sure everyone got 3 reviews back. Instead I want everyone to complete 3 peer reviews. I know I can manually assign peers for the students who only have 2 reviews to complete, but can I change it to 3 per reviewer without it deleting the assessments already completed by a few students? I think that's it for now. I really hope you can answer my questions. Thanks in advance",

Although our participants have asked us to enable late submissions, the tutors don't have time to do the manual allocation and notifications this would require.

I think there might be a way, but I don't have time to set up a test immediately.

          "Text": "Hello, I have a simple question related to Moodle workshop: is there any way to increase workshop submission max grade from 100 to 1000? 10000? MAXINT? And, if so, is there any way to increase rubric scores to more than 100? I guess these are hardcoded values, so if it's possible to change them on a single place in the source code, that doesn't sound very bad. Why? Well, if it matters: What I need is detailed exported data about every student's answer on every rubric question for his every assessment of assigned submissions. Workshop currently doesn't have very extensive export options so at the moment, I can't do what I want. But I can get exported data about every student's final submission grade given to/received from every other student (python code available on request). If I could reconstruct every answer on every rubric question from that single final score, it would solve my problem. And that is mathematically very possible, but I'd need rubric scores beyond 100. 10000 would probably do. How exactly? Again, if it matters: Lets say I have only 2 rubric questions, each with 3 possible answers: Yes, Mostly, and No. In the first question, I assign 0, 1 and 2 to the possible answers respectively. In the second question, I assign 0, 3 and 6 to the possible answers respectively. And as the result, from any final score I can reconstruct answers to each of the questions. For example, if the final score was 5, that means I have to write number 5 using base 3, which is 5=1*3^1+2*3^0 => 12, and those (1 and 2) are the answers (their scores) selected in grading. Of course, in that case the received score students get won't be understandable to them, not without additional explanations, but that's not a problem in my case. Thanks in advance! Juraj",

We have decided to use the workshop activity and made some improvement on it. https://invis.io/ZGB1A6CDE#/225769743_en-A1_Parametres-De-Base https://invis.io/ZGB1A6CDE#/229014113_S_With-Sub_1 We think that\nthis activity got a lot of potential but the learning curve and the usability issue for the teacher work against it. We got a lot of request for this kind of\nneeds but there is not a lot a people that use the workshop. So a lot of\nour effort is targeting the learning curve issue. 1- Wizard We want to\nguide the teacher in the configuration of this activity. We also want to put\nthe many parameters into context . With that we think that a teacher that do not\nknow how to use workshop could give it a try in a couple of minutes with the\nhelp of the wizard instead of giving up because he need a lot of time to figure\nout what to do with all the parameters. 2- Assignment\nof peers instead of submissions During our\nbrainstorming, we found it complicated to wait for the submission phase to\nassociate the works. In addition, the interface was very confusing. We found it\nsimpler to make these configurations from the beginning when the teacher\ncreates the activity. This has greatly simplified the interface. In addition,\nthis opens new possibilities as you will see further. 3- Allow\nassessment directly after submission We found this\ntracker : -\nWorkshop only allows one phase at a time - https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-27238 We apply some\nprinciples of this task into the sketch. 4- Allow\nassessment without submission We found this\ntracker : -\nAllow Workshop to assess without submission - https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-52191 We apply some\nprinciples of this task into the sketch. 5- Use the\nevaluation methods of assign To reduce the\nlearning curve of the teacher we will add the evaluation methods of assign into\nworkshop. - Add a\nconfig to hide grading methods - In\nthe sketch, we have hide comments and number of errors - Rename\naccumulating grading for simple direct gradings - Change the\nworkshop to get the possibility of use advanced grading method of assign - Migration\nscript from rubric of workshop to rubric of advanced grading methods - Delete\nrubric strategy of workshop After that we\nwill have that in workshop - simple\ndirect gradings (legacy workshop accumulating grading) - Marking\nguide (of advanced grading method) - Rubric (of\nadvanced grading method) 6-\nAnonymization of reviewer and reviewee We found it\nmuch simpler to put it in the interface than use the Advanced role override. Also, we are\nthinking about other features : - UX of the\nstudent What do you\nthink of that ?",

Students often do not read that which they were assigned to assess, and rarely give long enough useful comments. They just auto mark with a high grade and move on without doing any real assessment at all. The current grading method actually seems to allow assessors to do this, as they are not punished for short comments or dishonest grading practices. Is there a way to improve the grading method for specifically the assessors to encourage them to actually leave good comments and do the work? Are there any improvement plugins or can I somehow for comment length (or grade them for it?) Cheers",

That is what example submissions and assessments were supposed to be used for - to show examples of a good assessment and examples of a bad/insufficient assessment. How does it help to have a minimum required length for comments if students do not really feel like motivated to provide meaningful feedback? There is nothing that will prevent them to fill it with non-sense ballast to make the stupid system happy. Life - and laziness - finds a way. Technically it is possible to implement these things (comments required or minimum length required etc). But what is really broken here?",

Any Chinese educator would reply in a different way. The question of academic dishonesty, as well as the virtues of education itself, are seen quite differently here. I am not in a position to change a culture, and that is what you are asking me to do. This may seem like I am painting with a broad brush, but that truly isn't the case. Even the best students would be too afraid to give others low marks, as it costs them \"face\". The weaker students are simply there before they know the Chinese education system requires presence, not participation and will only do what is \"hard coded and tangibly required\" in order to squeak by. That means more than half of the class will only give two word comments. I'm not going to get in to the post-maoist refugee syndrome of every man for himself that is present here enlarge, but I will say that no amount of communication will convince more than half the class to leave reasonable criticism without some reward/punishment system in place. This makes it sound like I am at a terrible school, but I am actually teaching at one of the top universities of foreign languages in country. It is a cultural phenomenon that I must adapt to, not a pedagogical problem that I will be able to overcome as my superiors and colleagues are also of the culture in question and see it as a norm.",

I am not that naive to expect everybody happy about what we demand from them in schools. In fact, active participation and engagement of 50% of the class would look like the teacher's success to me - anywhere in the world. I guess I did not express my thoughts well. Things like minimum required length (in characters or sentences) are common in school assignments and it would make sense to have such an option available.

My primary concern is making things fair for everyone in my lectures, and the student who really give it their all is being knocked down by students who simply don't care. Imagine leaving several paragraphs in assessment, really going out of your way to help someone, and then receive two words in return: this is way too common. The fact is that China, despite it's many attempts to emulate the progression of other countries in the fields of academics, is still left in a sort of limbo. This is because culture itself is coming in to direct conflict with systems developed elsewhere. While China is trying to find her middle ground, there is still a state of general confusion and the university level students are of a generation where only fools don't exploit the system when given an opportunity. I sympathize, to some extent, I really do. As an outsider looking in, it is easy to see that much of this is asymptomatic of deeper cultural facets that are not up to me to judge. My wish is to navigate the system as best that I can with the best tools at my disposal. Moodle meets every need I have, save for this small problem. You're right when you say that it is fascinating from a pedagogical sense, but with the semester starting next week, my attention is on the practical application at the moment. :P",

If there is one sole student among five others trying to provide a fair assessment, and he/she will not give full grades (while those five others will), then it is this particular student who will be punished by getting the lower grade for assessment. It is important that teachers understand this behaviour and are able to interpret the calculated values correctly (and eventually intervene by setting weights or by adding own weighted assessment or so). Please check the Workshop documentation for details. Why are you using the Workshop in the end if you can't really trust those peer-grades? Maybe the Assignment would work better?

The mark is simply to make sure the work was done, and done reasonably well, as well as the assessment being done with some effort.

Sounds like you might mean the latter. In Moodle, \"module\" and \"activity\" are basically synonyms, one looking at the same from the technology side and another from the user side. How you use them for real-life activities is totally up to you. If you indeed mean a real-life workshop that you organize and want to use Moodle for online activities, you should set up a Moodle course and use any of the modules available to set up tasks and chores for your participants. The module (activity) names are meant to give you an idea what each does, but many people use them quite creatively for variety of things.",

I've never used it before but I am looking forward to trying it out. However, I was wondering if there is some way to do a trial run/create some fake students, populate it with fake answers, or something, so that I can test it from beginning to end? I've tried using the 'Mount Orange School' demo site which is useful to a degree. But what I'd really like best is to run my own one from beginning to end, from the student perspective and the teacher perspective, to see how it works and to spot any glitches. At the moment, the best I can think of is to do a trial run in class, but that could get messy and would take up valuable time. Thanks for any advice.",

You can switch the phase to the assessment one repeatedly as needed. Each iteration can even have different grading strategy selected. For example, you can gather initial feedback via the Comments grading strategy for the first round, let authors submit new versions of submission based on the feedback, and then assess it again with more formal accumulative or rubric strategy.

[This was a Teacher Professional Development programme for Use of ICT and hence contained teachers from different domains] The following was what I tried different: For W1, when the switch was made to assessment phase there were people who got 16-20 assignments for review. There were 3 unallocated submissions. For W2, when the switch was made initially there were 10-16 assignments per person and there were 5 unallocated submission. Now I changed the workshop back to Submission phase. Kept it open for some time (3 hours) and \"Remove current allocations: Ticked\". Now I observed that  \"To be allocated: 0\" and saw that many have received 25-34 submissions. Based on the experience of W1, we had specified that each one need to review only 4 more. But even then we have received queries from several confused participants. I have yet another workshop (W3) that I will release in few hours. The submission for this is due in 5 days. I will try to update this post if I experience a completely different behaviour. Regards Jk",

          "Text": "I am wondering if there is a pedagogical reasoning behind the following observation related to overriding submission/assessment scores: Moodle computes the \"Grade for assessment\" by averaging individual grades. It is possible to override one or more assessment scores individually . I n regards to “Grade for submission”, Moodle does not allow to override the scores individually . Only option is to override the final score. So these two functionalities (computing grade for assessment vs submission) are in odds with each other.  I would have really liked the ability to just override one of the received grades (for computing the grade of submission) but Moodle does not allow that!",

          "Text": "Thanks Gurman for opening this topic. Let me try and explain the reasoning for the current behaviour (I am the author of the Workshop 2.x code). As a teacher, you have several options to affect the grades given to students in the Workshop (in their role both as authors and as peer-reviewers). You can provide your own assessment, eventually with higher weight than peers have, so it will have bigger impact on the calculations. Your assessment is considered as another peer-assessment so it affects both the assessed submission's grade, and also the assessment grades of all others who assessed the submission, too. You can override the final grade for each submission, e.g. because you are the only one who know about some author's disabilities that led to receiving lower grade. So even if you accept all the peer-assessments, you still want to set the different grade. This way, you amend just the submission's grade without affecting reviewers' assessment grades. You can override the individual grade for assessment. That is the grade that is calculated by the grading evaluation plugin in use. The typical use case is when reviewers get lower grades from the \"comparison with the best assessment\" evaluation method just because their review is not \"in line\" with all others assessments of the same submission. Yet you realize that even if the reviewer was sole in their assessment, they were actually right. Maybe they were the only one who spotted a mistake or so. So you want to fix this particular mis-calculation. As a last resort, you can still override both final grades for submission and grade for assessment for each student in the gradebook once the grade is pushed there (which currently happens only when you are closing the workshop, this will be improved in the future). My reasoning was that when teachers are overriding a grade in the Workshop, they should have particular reason for that. So they re-grade particular submission (because this and that in this submission is good/wrong), or particular assessment (because this and that in this assessment is good/wrong). There should be a clear evidence that a particular grade has been overridden and for what reason. What you would like to have is the ability to override the submission grade coming from a single reviewer. But that grade is calculated by the selected grading strategy and is based on how the assessment form (e.g. rubric) has been filled. Imagine there are three reviewers of a submission. They all fill the assessment form (say a rubric) same. I believe it is reasonable to expect that same filled rubric should lead to same grade. Why would you want to override one of it? In my mind, it just goes against the whole idea of using multi-criterial assessment forms to achieve more objective assessment. That is what led me to implementing the current behaviour. I generally love the feedback from teachers working with the Workshop and I'll be happy to hear your use-cases / reasoning for your feature request. Thanks in advance!",

          "Text": "Thanks, David, for an in-depth explanation. I have an even better understanding of the choices I have to override the submission grade. However, I am probably still missing your point on having multiple reviewers provide the same grade because they are using the same rubric. I am using Workshop for students to do code review (among other things) of their peers. Based on the rubric, sometimes they are asked to identify a particular feature. Due to their own lack of knowledge or otherwise, they are unable to identify the feature in their peer's code even if it is there. As a result, they give a low grade. The contrasting situation can also occur: due to their lack of understanding the code/output or lack of applying the rubric correctly, they give higher grade than the peer deserves. For both these situations, I wanted to correct that reviewer's grade and thus, wanted to only change individual reviewer's grade. Does this make sense? It is possible I am not providing/using the rubric correctly or not understanding the philosophy behind the Workshop submissions - so any more light on this would be appreciated!",

No. The reviews are internally allocated per submission, not per user. So you need the submission first.

Is there a way to assign a Participant a set of students as reviewee's before the Participant has made that submittal? Well, yes. As long as those being-reviewed students themselves have submitted something. The reviewers themselves do not need to submit anything. set up the Workshop Participants with five students that will review them and five students that can be reviewed by them As said above, this is not easy, if possible, to set up. You would need to temporarily switch the workshop (which might be hidden yet from regular students) to the submission phase, log in as each participant, submit an empty draft submission and then allocate it for assessment. Once that is done, you can show the workshop to students. As long as the workshop remains in the submission phase, they can edit the pre-created submission records.",

My students often get confused about when the completion check mark is going to appear. They don't see it after submission, and they don't see it after assessment either! So I include a glossary-linked tip about this, saying that they'll see the check mark only after the Workshop is closed by me. Ravi",

I think I can set up the anonymity by altering the mod/workshop:viewreviewernames permissions for the student role. The trouble is Workshop doesn't function in the described way when it comes to groups. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to put together this workflow for a group? We're a Moodlerooms school, and don't have much access to back-end code. Sidenote: I recognize the setup may seem inflexible, but the instructor is attempting to model the peer review model for scientific journal articles. Current Idea: My workaround idea is to have one student submit from each group, then enter the assessment phase and have every student review every paper (they'd write \"This is my paper\" when they get the assessment for their own). This still seems a bit clunky.",

We want this too. The ability to limit file type for file upload submissions Does anywhere else in Moodle do this (e.g. assignment module)? But, when we are getting the student to upload a file, can we have a restriction of which file types. E.g. requring an image. Or requiring a .doc document? Automatically allocate late submissions You can re-allocate late submissions, but only by fiddling around with the phases. It would be nice to automate it with a schedule task. This would require MDL-47798 . MDL-27238 asks for even more than this, but we don't need to go that far. Need a clear list of non-submitters that respects group mode If you are using separate groups, then that makes the list of people who have submitted easy to work with in big courses. However, there is no easy way to see a list of people in one group who have not submitted, and we would like that so tutors can monitor the students in their own group. Custom activity completion conditions: Submitted and Assessment complete It would be nice to add a couple of automatic completion conditions for the activity completion system. One that lets you automatically mark the activity complete when you have done your submission, and one that marks it complete when you have done your assessment. (Presumably most of the time you would want to turn on both options, if you were turning this on at all, but probably best to leave them as separate settings.",

And, which is worse, they can also realize at five-to-twelve (deadline) that they do not fulfil the requirement. If the format is important, it should be one of the assessed criteria. Opinion: I would prefer not to limit it. Re: Automatically allocate late submissions MDL-27238 will happen anyway, ideally in Moodle 3.0.

I've got 55 students in this class, and the assessment is 20% of their final project grade. I'm concerned that maybe I messed something up? I definitely appreciate your help.

          "Text": "Hi, I use the workshop activity quite often and I like it a lot! Today I realized a strange behavior: If a student has to grade two other submissions, but only grades one of them, she/he is still able to get the top grade. Example: Students have to grade two submissions each. The workshop activity is configured to award up to 80.0 points for the submission and up to 20.0 points for the assessment. Student A grades only one submission and forgets about the second one. Exprected behavior: each graded submission should count as 10 points or less. Two grades per student makes a total of 2x10=20 points. What happens: Student A is able to get 20.0 points, despite grading only one submission. Occurs in: Moodle 2.8.5+ (Build: 20150313) and Moodle 2.6.1+ (Build: 20140213) Is this a bug or am I missing an important setting? Simon",

          "Text": "Hello, Just wanted to let you know about a couple of write-ups from two iterations of using Workshop with a small-ish cohort of students using it for non-compulsory peer review.  The write-ups go into the nitty gritty  of the settings and anticipating pitfalls - I hope they are useful. Any further suggestions based on your experience would be much appreciated. The major insight for us was the importance of the instructions - understanding how and when the description, instructions for submission, and instructions for assessment display to students, and using the News Forum to remind students about what to do any when - this latter required the tutors to write diary notes to send out those Forum posts (Moodle Events may help us here in future). The change to Workshop we would most appreciate is allocation on demand, allowing tutors to set a softer deadline without having to manually allocate late work. We've reached a high level of satisfaction now with both students and staff - thank you David and all for a really helpful activity. First iteration: http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/ele/2015/02/13/peer-review-with-the-moodle-workshop-activity-a-close-look/ Second iteration: http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/ele/2015/03/18/a-good-peer-review-experience-with-moodle-workshop/ All the best, Mira - University College London",

          "Text": "This thread follows on (after a rather longer deplay than I was expecting) from https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=283014 We have a number of small requests around usability , or rather, we have a list of things we know some users struggled with. We don't necessarily have solutions. Ability to add information/instructions 'Overall assessment' There is an option 'Overal feedback mode' that gives the\nstudent to box in which to type and overall comment, after completing the rest of the grading form. However, there is no way to give instructions next to that box, like\nthere is for the other aspects of the grading method. Inconsistent editors when assessing On the assessment form, the input box for each of the Apsects is a plain textarea, but the input for the 'Overall assessment' is a HTML editor. I think we would like them to all be HTML editors. Students get confused by the intructions when reviewing their submission Even after the end of the submission phase, when a student reviews their submission (e.g. http://school.demo.moodle.net/mod/workshop/submission.php?cmid=651&id=48 ) the \"Instructions for submission\" are shown first, and are often written imperatively (\"Write three sentences ...\"). Apparently some students got confused by this, because when you are reviewing, you can't do that! I wonder if a solution to this is as simple as collapsing the instructions for submission by default when reviewing. (They are already in a collapsible region.) The link to review a submission is not easy to find The link to review your own submission is just the title of that submission. This was not obvious to all students. It might be better to change it to be a separate 'Review submission' link. Save and continue does not work well with requried fields The assessment form has a 'Save and continue editing' button. Students assuemd they could use this to stop half way through assessing, and come back later. However, since all the fields on the assessment form are required, you can't acutally do that. You have to fill in all the boxes (if only with junk) before you can save. If you do fill all the boxes with junk, you have not way of being reminded that you have not actually finished assessing. The ability to save partially complete assessments, to finish later, would be good (but a pain to implement). Option to display reviews by aspect, not reviewer At the moment, you see the review given by each user, and\nfor each user, and each review comments on a number of aspects. In this case it\nwould be good if there was the option to have the display grouped by aspect, and under each aspect, you\nsaw all the comments from each reviewer.",

However, if it seemed too \"distant\" for your testers, I can imagine specific instructions for this field to be displayed just next to it. Opinion: Why not. Re: Inconsistent editors when assessing Any particular reason for rich text formatting here? I would say that plain text for answers to individual aspects is enough as I do not expect them to be too long and structured. I intentionally wanted to keep HTML formatting limited. I do not think that \"it should be HTML because the overall assessment is\" is strong enough argument for me. The reasoning for HTML editor support in the overall feedback was the ability to embed and attach files (such as corrected version of the submission). And I do not like HTML editors enabled without the files support. Opinion: I'm not a huge fan . Re: Students get confused by the intructions when reviewing their submission Good point and a nice suggestion. Opinion: +1 Re: The link to review a submission is not easy to find Yes, good point. There are quite a few places in the Workshop where adding an explicit button for the expected action would help. This is probably one of the cases related to MDL-46396 . Opinion: +1 Re: Save and continue does not work well with required fields Right. What about being a bit more pragmatic here. Instead of implementing the whole workflow / state machinery for assessments, let us just reword the button to something like Save this assessment and show next or so. Re: Option to display reviews by aspect, not reviewer Oh that's a really nice and useful idea! Indeed it is something that each grading strategy subplugin has under its own control but such different views of the assessment should be possible. Opinion: Yes!",

It does not really belong in any of these threads, but I will put it here: After each course is finished, we switch users from the standard Student role, to a Read-only student role. Our Read-only student role does not have mod/workshop:submit. Unfortunately, this means that when students get made read-only all the submissions disappear from the workshop UI. Is there a good way around that, or does this lead to a new feature request: split mod/workshop:submit into mod/workshop:submit and mod/workshop:viewmysubmission?",

          "Text": "We have been trialling using the Workshop module at the Open University. As a results of this we have a list of changes we think would be a good idea, or at least that we would like to discuss. I will probably post about then in a few separate threads, where I will group the changes by topic. If people agree with our proposals, I will make tracker issues for them. This first set should be relatively un-controversial. There are some accessibility issues we have spotted: The current phase is only indicated by hilighting one row in the table. You cannot show something with colour alone. Therefore, there needs to be some extra text to indicate the current Phase, possibly with class=\"accesshide\". Alternatively, MDL-44010 might be a solution, but I don't think so. We are using the \"Comments\" grading method, but this probably applies to \"Accumulative\" too, and perhaps some others. When students are grading, the description of each aspect is not properly linked to the corresponding input box using <label> tags, or aria-labelledby, so screen-reader users find it difficult to complete the grading form. Various parts of the interface had insufficient contrast , which would make it hard for partially sighted users. We should tweak the CSS to increase the contrast. (Actually, I think this issue related to the file-picker, not the Workshop.) Any objections before I make tracker issue for these?",

The points 2. and 3. above are clear bugs and should be fixed. I'll be happy to discuss with your accessibility experts and follow their suggestions on this. With regards to the point 1., it indeed is a clear bug too. I've had a plan to replace the current \"workshop planner\" (the table with phases) for a long time but did not manage to find time for it yet. The current solution has multiple issues - most notably for mobile and small screen devices. Firstly, setting that widget's width to less than 100% all the time is suboptimal. It is not responsive. And overall, it is a table which it should not be. If we agree that displaying a \"wizard-like\" element that displays all the past, current and future tasks the user is going through in the workshop, I would really like to reimplement it into more appropriate HTML structure (list, or maybe definition list) and style it as horizontally aligned blocks. In any case, the current phase (or just the current individual's state in the future) will have to be clearly identified from the accessibility point of view. So, definitely my +10 on all these.",

The problem is that the platform does not calculate the evaluation score that gave the couple , but it will automatically registers 20 , this being false, because there the percentage that participants give their peers actually recorded . The other problem is that you can not hide the couple's name being evaluated and that can be a big problem among students.

You as the teacher are supposed to switch the workshop to the Grading evaluation phase and let it calculate (and aggregate) the grades. If you are happy with them, close the workshop (by switching it to the last stage). The grades as well as received assessments are displayed to your students in the Closed phase only. Should I have used that strategy instead? It really depends on what you want. As you are using rubric, you probably want some grade for submission to be received. You can't achieve that with the comments strategy, it purely for getting feedback with no grade.",

Due to that weight being changed, the calculated grade from all evaluated aspects does have to change as well. Unfortunately, we detected the error during the assessment phase, when some students did already submit their assessments, and we found that Moodle doesn't recalculate the grade. So now we have some well-calculated grades (using the correct weight) along with some bad-calculated grades. So, is there any means to tell Moodle to recalculate all grades of submitted assessments? We found that if we \"enter as\" some student with a bad-calculated assessment and we re-assess the affected submissions without changing anything, moodle recalculates the final grade, but, as you would agree, this is a very annoying and time consuming task...

Looking at the code in mod/workshop/form/accumulative/lib.php there's a method \"calculate_peer_grade\" that is probably the one tha does the job. I've no PHP experience, but I've some knowledge of MySQL and Python, and fortunately I've access to the moodle database so I wrote a little Python script that did the job. I want to share this solution in case others are in the same situation, so find attached this script at the end of the message. However, In the workshop toolbox there's already a button to do some recalculations. I think it would be extremely easy to call there the \"calculate_peer_grade\" method to do a complete recalc, as the code is already there (perhaps it's only necessary to put this call into a loop).

          "Text": "In this issue: MDL-27238 the suggestion is made to allow more flexibility of which phase students are in. David has suggested: What is doable is to introduce a new phase covering both submission and assessment phase. I still resist to allow any on-the-fly calculation of the final grades because they rely on all submissions are available. Still, there are many open questions that must be answered prior any actual development can start. Most notably: How should submissions allocation behave? I can imagine a new allocator type (\"instant\" for example) that would automatically allocate the submission immediately after it is saved and marked as final by the student. Note this automatically enforces that a submission can be reviewed by a student that has not submitted anything yet (otherwise, the first submission could not get any reviewer). How to improve the submission workflow and keep it still easy to understand for students. The author has to mark (tag) the submission as \"ready for assessment\". But then, maybe on the initial feedback from the reviewers, the student has to have an option to switch the status back to \"work in progress\" (when no other assessment is possible) and then submit it for assessment again. Do we expect that the submission is re-allocated in this case? In other words, I believe it is possible to allow submission + assessment phase overlapping. But to calculate the grades, both submitting and assessing must be finished. Most significantly, the allocation of submissions seems to be a tricky one: When the first student submits their work, there is nothing else to be allocated to them for assessment. When the second student submits their work, there is only one work to be allocated. Should it be allocated or not? Students might easily abuse this behaviour to \"choose\" their own reviewer, instead of having them assigned randomly. As other students are submitting their work, the pool of submission is getting bigger and bigger and the allocation may seem to work. Still we have pretty unbalanced situation as early submissions are already assigned for assessments and hence are unlikely to be assessed by students who submit their own work later. At the end of this time scale there is another problem emerging. The very last submission must be allocated to someone. But by that time those students may think that their task was already done. In other words, students never know if there is some submission to be allocated for them yet or not. Until the phase is closed, they never know the expected amount of work to do (\"Mr Boerman, I already did all assigned peer-reviews last week. I did not know that a new submission can appear\"). I will follow with a post with my suggestions. David asks that we work through these issues in this forum to make sure the needs of the community are taken into account.",

          "Text": "Here are some of my suggestions regarding David's questions: As David suggests, set a lower limit for starting the review allocation process. For example, require at least 3 submissions before allocating any reviewers. Prior to that point, display \"Insufficient submissions to start allocation process\" to students, instead of a grade. This deals with several points of concern that David raised. This limit should not affect self-assessment, which should take place immediately upon submission, with an opportunity for the student to update their own work before allocation to others. If students are going to self-assess, it should be done as quickly as possible so they can have the material fresh in their minds, and they should be able to correct errors before letting the process go further. I would be reluctant to allow the student to continue to revise between this point and the completion of the required number of peer reviews. An option to restrict allocation to those students who have been given a grade of at least n for that assignment would be helpful. The instructor would assess the first couple of students, then they would be able to assess others. This allows a \"snowball\" effect of more and more potential assessors. This addresses another of David's key points. Yes, later submitters will be allocated to other later submitters for assessment, but the assessors are validated in this process, so there should be less of an impact on the quality of assessment. Set a lower limit of number of peer assessments before displaying a grade. If there have not been enough peer reviews yet, display \"grading incomplete\" or similar message to the student, rather than a grade for the assignment. Obviously, this number could be set to 0 for teacher-only assessments or 1 if the student should be able to see partial grades. Set the number of required assessments per student, and display to each student the number of assessments they have completed whenever they check the Workshop (or even better, in the student view after the link to the workshop). Allow the instructor to set a due date after which no more student assessments will be allocated (the instructor will have to decide whether to assess stragglers at that point). This addresses David's last point. Finally, there is an ongoing discussion of how to handle resubmissions within the Assignment module [ MDL-36804 ]. Ultimately, I think it would be helpful to merge Assignment and Workshop modules, but in the meantime, some kind of audit trail of submissions needs to be maintained, and possibly multiple rounds of resubmission and peer review should be supported in Workshop, with an instructor option to maintain reviewers in consistent groups (probably using the Groups feature) or re-allocating in each round of revisions. This is consistent with supporting good writing process by encouraging multiple drafts of major works with review and revision between each draft (i.e. what I usually think of as the \"workshop\" process.)",

          "Text": "We are using a moodle course for handling submission and assessment of the degree dissertations in our Faculty. We are dealing with 450 dissertations per year and 300-400 tutors grading them (some of them reviewing 2-3 dissertations). In Moodle 1.9 we used the activity \"assignment\" but  this implied that tutors should have teacher/editor permissions and they could have a look at all dissertations and assessments with no privacy for the student-tutor relation. Later we used a \" database \" with impossible requirements for visualisation, so that tutors (a modified student role) could only see their own contribution to the database. This year we are trying to use the workshop. The idea is that students submit their dissertations to the workshop. Tutors (a copy of the student role with another name) are allocated manually to review their corresponding students. And results will be easily obtained by giving a 100% value to the peer review scores (=tutors' grading). In such a situation, in which dissertation submissions are not synchronous, it would be interesting to have both phases -submission & assessment- opened at the same time. A related problem is that you cannot allocate students-tutors unless students have made a submission. This is logical for automatic allocations, but for manual allocations it would not be necessary. It would be practical to make manual allocations even when the students have not made any submission (yet). More flexibility among phases (allocation, submission, assessment), particularly in combination with manual allocation would be welcome.",

Referees are other students in the same group, does not depend whether they have submitted their works or not. The student will have to do improvements in his work according to his reviewers and only after that \"phase\" the teacher would grade his work (and referees for their judgement as well).

          "Text": "I have very strong feelings about this and have proposed different solutions from time to time. I am experimenting with a peer review tool called SWoRD out of University of Pittsburgh. They have a feature called soft deadlines. The way it works is you set the submission due date in the past. When a student submits a paper, the system then allows them to request a paper to review. There is an algorithm that selects the paper that has been waiting longest with the fewest number of reviewers. After one review is complete, the reviewer can then request more papers to review. In my dream world, this is how workshop would work. Rather than being driven by dates, it could be driven by events. Event one: paper submission Result: student can request papers to review (if none are available, or if there are too few in the system to prevent collusion or ensure anonymity, the user may need to come back later) Event two: the student has reviewed all required papers and their paper has been reviewed the required number of times Result: a grade is generated Some possible ideas additional ideas include: Allow people to request additional papers to review for extra experience, and possibly extra points This could help ameliorate the problem of some students not doing their reviews Dates could still play a role as a soft \"best if done by\" deadline to help keep the class on roughly the same pace I would assign a small amount of bonus or penalty point for doing the assignment early or late, but let the students manage their own time. The interface would allow students to petition grades and request instructor comment I imagine using this in large university classes where it would be too difficult to assign and grade numerous large writing assignments without peer review. In this system I get the best of both worlds. The students get quality writing assignments and detailed feedback from peers using a rubric and comments. If they are unhappy with their grade or would like an \"expert\" opinion on their writing, they have complete access to the instructor's feedback. I use this on assignments where there are no real right answers, it is just graded on completeness and polish. I envision a day where I create a MOOC with thousands of students in it, all starting and finishing the class at different times, having a rich and engaging experience that would be impossible otherwise.",

With the current setup, the prof has to be there and ready at 6pm on Sunday to manually allocate students as quickly as possible, which is a pain.  So it would be great if she could manually assign the peer reviewers ahead of time so that they are given their assignments as soon as the submission phase is done.

The Workshop has been designed so that the assessment allocation is a relation between a reviewer and a submission, not between two users. I can see two possible approaches to your use case though. First, try to use the scheduled allocation combined with the automatic assessment phase switch. Set the submission deadline at Sunday 6 pm, let submissions allocated randomly by the scheduled allocator and let the Workshop to be switched to the assessment phase automatically. That way, the teacher does not need to be involved and students can spend their Sunday evening by doing assessments. The other option would be a custom allocation plugin that would have to be developed. The teacher would preset required allocations in advance and then, the allocator would try to actually assign them, if possible (i.e. if the submission actually exists). So it would work similarly to the scheduled allocation method, but using the predefined relations between authors and reviewers. Obviously, the first alternative can be used immediately, the second one requires custom development.",

          "Text": "Right. The link to the docs page is http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Data_manipulation_API . Their current code \n```text\n$sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM {$CFG->prefix}plagiarism_crot_files WHERE path ='$path' AND courseid = $course AND cm = $cmid ORDER BY file_id DESC LIMIT 1\";\n```\n violates the expected API usage at least in the following areas: If possible, methods like get_records() or get_records_select() etc should be used instead of providing the full SQL. This makes the code more cross-database compliant. Specifying full query should be used only if there is no other way. In Moodle 2.x, we do not use {$CFG->prefix} any more in SQL queries. The table name itself should be wrapped by curly braces as in {plagiarism_crot_files} and the $DB automatically prepends the prefix if needed. Variables expansion in SQL queries (i.e. having $path, $course, $cmid there) is a very bad practise as it makes the query potentially vulnerable to SQL injections. Correct way is to use placeholders, either named (e.g. :courseid) or unnamed (via question marks). Specifying LIMIT at the end is not generally cross-database compatible (even if in this simple case it might be) and $DB methods provide explicit parameters for that. So basically, this particular code could (and probably should) be achieved by something like \n```text\n$files = $DB->get_records('plagiarism_crot_files', array('path' => $path, 'courseid' => $cid, 'cm' => $cmid), 'file_id DESC', 0, 1);\n$file = reset($files);\n```\n or, if they really insisted on having the full query explicit: \n```text\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM {plagiarism_crot_files} WHERE path = ? AND courseid = ? AND cm = ? ORDER BY file_id DESC\";\n$params = array($path, $cid, $cmid);\n$files = $DB->get_records_sql($sql, $params, 0, 1);\n$file = reset($files);\n```",

This will be tedious, because the grade for submission is calculated from the two aspects. The aspect grades do not appear for all students, on one web page.

When you click \"Re-calculate grades\" during the Grading evaluation phase, the Workshop recalculates final received grades for all submissions, as well as final grading grades for all reviewers. if I understand your view correctly, then yes. These calculations happen in clusters. In that mean that every final grade for submission is calculated from all reviews/assessments for the given submission (so if a submission was assessed by 5 reviewers, these 5 assessments form the final grade for that submission). every reviewer's final grading grade is calculated as a mean of all individual grading grades that the reviewer got. So, if Alice's submission was peer-assessed by Barbara, Cindy and Dona and Alan's submission was peer-assessed by Barbara, Charles and Dan, then Barbara's grading grade is calculated as a mean of two grading grades (because she did two reviews). The first of these grades is calculated by comparing Barbara's assessment with Cindy's and Dona's one. The second grading grade is calculated by comparing Barbara's assessment with Charles' and Dan's one.

This simple grading evaluation method gives credit to peer-reviewers just for their participation in the activity without comparing their assessment with the others. There are three modes of how grades for assessment are calculated by this method. All or nothing - The reviewer must assess all allocated submissions in order to obtain the maximum grade; otherwise they receive a grade of zero. Proportional - The grade obtained is proportional to the number of assessments. If all allocated submissions are assessed, the reviewer will obtain the maximum grade; if half of the allocated submissions are assessed, the reviewer will obtain 50% of the maximum grade. At least one - The reviewer must assess at least one allocated submission in order to obtain the maximum grade. See MDL-37603 and https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=workshopeval_credit",

I don't know if anything changes for students outside of those particular clusters. Also, when I went back in to either override or add myself as an assessor, there were grade changes within the clusters of  grades given, grades received when I inserted my self (or multiple selves, depending on weight assigned). I think students may be satisfied if their individual grades go up, and not down. I realize that there may be settings in the grade book to block visibility of the evolving grades. That is a juggling act, as I have not wanted to delay grade visibility for the majority of students who completed work early or on time.",

Once you grade the submission, do not forget to re-calculate grades so that is taken into account.

So I emailed some of the very early 'early birds' to ask if they would agree to reviewing an extra student, so that all persons who wanted to complete the assignment ahead of time would be able to do so. I am teaching RN-BSN, and the course is totally online. Most of the students work 12 hour shifts, in clusters of days, so when they get to course work, I like for them to be able to move on with the work, instead of having to wait. Next, not sure if I understood properly, but if you have had 12 Workshops, how are you dealing with the Assessment grade (grading grade)? I also have set Workshop for each student to grade 3 other students. I have 2 cases where the grader was correct, but the other two graders in the cluster gave inflated grades and failed to recognize poor work. So the correct grader got severely penalized (possibly a letter grade, not sure yet, but looks like it could be), while the incorrect graders got nice, high assessment grades! So I went through trials and tribulations, added myself as grader and overweighted my self (a lot, to count myself as 8 or 12 persons)!, and/or overrode the low grader's correct grade to an incorrect, but fairer, high grade. For this, my 1st Workshop, I did not override the incorrect high grader's grade to a correct lower grade, in fear of appeals and law suits, given that Moodle does not provide a formula/specification/algorithm that can be explained to colleagues, students, lawyers, etc.",

We find the possibilities of this module very impressive especifically the possibility to grade the grading process. We had a search about the grading algorithms because we wanna give explanations about it to students. We wanna use the accumulative evaluation that is described by the following formula : http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Workshop_2.0_specification#Accumulative In this formula, the grade is computed based on a ratio composed of - the grade given by the student for one criteria as numerator; - the maximum grade given by all students for that criteria as denominator. We think such ratio will encourage students to give high scores (while giving 100% to all peers ensures them to have 100% as evaluators). Intuitively, we would prefer de denominator to be the mean or median grade among all students given grades. What do you think about it ? Is there a scientific justification for the choice of the maximum value ? Are there other options for this formula based on scientific argumentation ? Finally, if we wanna tune the formula, in which file do we have to make the change ? Thanks in advance for answer, Zabelle",

Firstly, the Accumulative grading strategy (with up-to-date docs available at http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Workshop_grading_strategies#Accumulative_grading_strategy ) determines how the grade for submission is calculated. It has nothing to do with the grade for assessment. The formula describes how the grade for submission is calculated from the filled assessment form. It is a standard formula for weighted mean. The denominator is the sum of weights of all aspects in the form (or, if they all have the same weight equal to 1, their count), not a maximum grade given by all students, as you say. Also, I can't agree with your conclusion that students are encouraged to give high scores. The grading evaluation method \"Comparison with the best assessment\" (documented at http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Using_Workshop#Grade_for_assessment ) gives high grade for those assessments that are closer to a \"common sense\" which itself is determined as the mean of all received assessments. In any case, you are free to implement your own grading evaluation method in as a subplugin and use it in your courses. The Moodle plugins directory already contains one such alternative. For the reference, let me point you to another thread in this forum where the calculation of grades for assessments was discussed.",

          "Text": "In Workshop, I have several students who correctly gave low scores to other students with poor work. Mostly, I had each student grade three other students, due to information from hours, days, weeks and months of searching in Moodle, eventually to find that's what Moodle demands in order to calculate an assessment grade. So, within each correct student's set of co-graders, the other two graders graded higher, but not as well. But the incorrect graders' scores clustered together, such that whatver Moodle is doing with these grades, the correct grader was outdistanced, and got a harsh 'grading grade'. Due to the extreme difficulty of finding answers, and the trial and error nature of implementing Workshop, I am now resorting to additional trial and error, to add my own assessment, give it a substantial weight, such as 8 or 12, making me equivalent to 8 or 12 persons! And/or overriding the assessment grade, such that the resulting grading grade is incorrect for the criteria, but such that the correct student grader's assessment grade is near to the an appropriate numeric value.  I have NOT yet tried to override the poor graders' assessment grades downward, because there are more of them, and I would be incoherrent in a court of law, trying to explain how these grades were determined by Moodle. Actually, I would be able to explain what I did, but I doubt that irate students and/or their parents and lawyers would acquiesce. At this point in time, I have 2/19 students with this issue. One of those had an additional issue, with correct grading of one Aspect of the assignment, but incorrectly harsh grading of the other Aspect of the assignment. So I had lots of trial and error, added my own assessment, and overweighted my own assessment, until the harsly graded student's grade came up to a better numerical value. Hmm, have there been any law suits involving faculty, universities, and Moodle due to Moodle computation of Workshop assessment grades? Is there any specification, algorithm, or, in my words, formula or set of formulas, since 2009, for Moodle 2.4.4?",

I am finding that they always show as length 00:00 If you go to jacwebhosting.co.uk there is going to be one on the home page of the site showing people how to log in. I have tried 3 different browsers here at work and one via RDP at home. Two at work I suspect don't have relevant plugins as they just show a link to the file. This is in fact more useful than what the other one ( IE 9) does as at least you can download the file and play it. IE 9  shows a video box with controlls but clicking play does very little and looking at properties shows the video to be 00:00 in length. Chrome does similar on the PC I am using via RDP. IE is using WMP to try and play the file. I can play the file happily on the computer using WMP but just not in moodle pages. Can anyone help with this. Even if it is just to tell me you have tried it and it works fine for you which would indicate some issue with plugins here. Thanks in advance. John. Using Win 7 & Moodle 2.52 (Win xp via RDP)",

Each one doing just its job: If automatic phase switching is enabled then the Workshop will switch to the assessment phase automatically after the submission deadline. Just that. If the scheduled allocation is explicitly enabled at the Scheduled allocation method page then it will automatically allocate submissions for assessment after the submission deadline. Just that. So yes, you can set automatic switching only. But then all what happens is that you would find the Workshop in the assessment phase with no submissions allocated. And vice versa. You can enable just the scheduled allocator - so you would find the Workshop still in the submission phase but with submissions allocated. Apparently, using the combination of both features is what you want to do in 99% of cases. Still we follow the general principle \"do one thing and do it well\" when developing subplugins for Workshop so that's why it is done as it is now. HTH",

As it has been described in the docs as well as answered in forums, it's important to realize that in the Accumulative strategy, the actual maximum grade for each aspect does not influence its weight. So both aspects in your setup have the same weight (as both have it set to \"1\"). The final grade is calculated as an arithmetic mean of them. For example in the first assessment, given grades for aspect 1 and aspect 2 are 4/4 and 5/6, respectively. The total grade is then calculated as (4/4 + 5/6)/2 = 0.91666 which is then correctly displayed as 9.17 of 10.00. If you expected it being counted as (4 + 5)/(4 + 6) then you need to use the Rubric strategy (displayed in the grid or list layout of your choice).

Here is our scenario: students are assigned 3 peers to assess (anonymously- which can be done now) and then rate the effort or helpfulness of the feedback they received. The grade for the assignment is based on the evaluation of your work and the quality of the feedback you provide to others.

Let us imagine the following scenario: Alice submits her essay. The essay is allocated to Bob, Cindy and Dan for assessment. All three reviewers fill the assessment form (say a rubric) The teacher switches the workshop into the grading evaluation phase and (which would have to be added to the current workshop code), Alice has a chance to see the reviews and rate them. Now, let us say that Alice fully accepts Bob's assessment, partially agrees with Cindy's assessment and completely disagrees with Dan's review. How would she express this? Using a scale? Or percentage \"acceptance\" level? And then, how exactly would this \"acceptance\" influence grades that Bob, Cindy and Dan get for the assessment? Let us imagine that the teacher uses the \"Comparison with the best assessment\" evaluator. That would calculate grades, for example: Bob 100%, Cindy 100% and Dan 42%. Now, how these grades should get amended? I am asking for some formula or exact description. It sounds like an interesting feature, really. But we need it specified into a deeper details.",

The model we are trying to support here uses a rubric and a 5 point scale for both the peer assessment of submitted work (assessment 1- 50% of the grade) and assessment of feedback ( assessment 2- 50% of the grade) Currently this translates 0-5 into a percent when displaying a final mark. 0 = 0% 1 = 20% 2 = 40% 3 = 60% 4 = 80% 5 = 100% So in your scenario above, Bob would receive 100% from Alice, Cindy would receive maybe 40% from Alice, and Dan would receive 0. These values would have to be calculated back to form part of the Bob, Cindy, and Dan's  assessment 2. If feels so \"almost there\" but maybe I'm just an optimist. Thanks for any further thoughts.

If they could upload their assignments and make them accessible to others in their class, I think students would enjoy this feature for commenting on each other’s work. Any suggestions? I know there is a Workshop activity designed for peer assessment but using uploadpdf would be more interactive and even enjoyable for them. I have used Moodle Forums in the past where students share their assignments in Word format and use Word’s comment feature for annotation but this UploadPDF would be far better. Any suggestions would be great. It would even be more amazing if UploadPDF was usable within the workshop activity but I doubt that is feasible. Any and all feedback on this welcome! Thank you",

I just recently started using the Workshop module again and just realized from Ruben's question that being able to add audio and video into a workshop would be perfect for what I am trying to teacher right now. So...I was trying it when your suggestion about the Algebra filter hit my inbox. I don't think turning off the filters will fix it...at least it doesn't for me in the Workshop activity for Moodle 2.4.3+ (Build: 20130405). I have tried flv, mp3, and mp4 files and they will all play in the Insert Moodle Media window prior to the actual insert. With my filter on (PoodLL), the player shows, but when clicked, nothing happens. When I turn off all the filters, it shows whichever filename I have inserted, but as soon as you click the filename, the message \"Sorry, the requested file could not be found More information about this error\" along with a continue button, shows up. I have even double-checked all the moodledata folder permission to make sure they were all still set to correctly...they were. I don't have time tonight, but I will compare results in my other Moodle installs tomorrow evening. (2.2, 2.3, and 2.5) Hoping for a quick and easy fix, AL",

The allocator tries hard to produce balanced results but that is not always possible. As Leon suggests, if it is more important for you to have the same amount of work for each student, you may wish to prefer fixed number per reviewer (but then, some submissions may get assessed three times and some just once, for example). It really depends on whether you prefer equal workload for your students or equal amount of feedback per submission. Also note that the group mode affects this. In Visible groups mode, the allocator tries to pick reviewers from as many groups as possible. And that is probably why you get these results if the number of members are not equal across groups. In Separate groups mode, reviewers are picked from the user's own group only.",

The groups (each group represents a tutorial of about 16 or 17 students; the course is set up in forced separate group mode) are separate to make it easier for the teaching assistants to assign participation marks for the reviews. It's not a problem for a reviewer to get more than two reviews back on an assignment, but it would be a problem for a reviewer to only have one review to do.

Several classes use the same workshop.  Peer assessment needs to take place within that class.  Classes rarely run back to back.  Students in one class are sometimes absent thus submit/assess late.  In the old system, we just opened up the dates so that 'start submitting' and 'start assessing' were sometime in the 70's and the 'end of submissions' and 'end of assessment' was the lastest possible year (2020 IFAIK).  That meant that anyone could submit any time.  When they did, it was passed straight through to the assessor. We the new version, we find that we are constantly flipping workshops between submit and assess depending on what exact stage that class are at.  Even worse if you do happen to have two classes using the same workshop at the same time, but at different stages. What am I missing here?  Or have I the wrong tool for the job? Thanks, Geedle.",

          "Text": "Hi Gareth. You are right, this is how the new Workshop has been intentionally designed. I can imagine you see it as a flaw but there were certain good reasons for such behaviour. As I understand your scenario correctly, the peer-assessment takes place within the class only, right? So there is no \"cross-class\" assessment. In that case you may want to consider creating separate instances (copies) of the Workshop for each class. Each Workshop would have its deadlines set individually as needed. You may want to use such a setup together with the group-members-only feature so that students in each class see just their workshop and not the other copies.",

          "Text": "I've been using the Workshop module for a half term now and I'm incredibly confused about how it assigns assessment grades to the pupils. For example: I've assessed a student's submission and assigned my own assessment a weight of 16 so it gets chosen as the best, which it does and I am awarded full marks (50 in this case). 6 other students have also assessed the piece of work. I would expect any student who gave it the same mark as me to score 50, with the marks decreasing the further from my assessment score they went. This does not happen. The list of marks looks like this: 21(50)@16 - me 26(24) - student 1 27(46) - student 2 21(46) - student 3 21(50) - student 4 29(40) - student 5 24(49) - student 6 The Workshop Module awarded this piece of work 22. Students 2 and 3 both awarded 21, but got different assessment scores. Student 2 gave a very different mark compared to all the others and got the second best mark. There seems to be no pattern at all; what on Earth is going on here?",

Therefore the evaluation plugin compares individual criteria rather than the final grade. See https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=153268#p670406 for more details. Also note that it is actually student 4 who got the full mark as well - I would expect that their assessment is the same as yours and therefore they get 50 too. Then student 6 will have a slightly different one, still giving them 49. And so on. Look at the assessment by student 1 in more details. You should realize that even their assessment led to the grade 26 (compared to the grade 21 based on your assessment), it will be probably very different from yours when it comes to comparing individual aspects (dimensions) of the submission.

          "Text": "Hi all. I'm upgrading the AJAX Marking Block to better support core modules, but I'm not sure under what conditions I should make unmarked workshop submissions show up for the new workshop in 2.x. At the moment it finds any submissions in workshops that are not closed, where you have not assessed them yourself. Is this enough to cover all use cases? Things I need to work out: Are there use cases where you (the teacher) would not do an assessment at all? Do you want to see new submissions during the submission phase so that you can then allocate them to assessors? In the grading evaluation phase, will it be useful to have a single pop-up of some sort per submission (as per all other items in the AJAX marking block), or is it best to just have a link to the main workshop page as happens at the moment. The normal mode of operation for the AJAX MArking block is to remove stuff that needs attention as it's dealt with so that your 'total to mark' gets lower. Is there any indicator (or combination of indicators) for submissions in the grading evaluation phase that would show that you are happy witht the grade? I get the impression that just leaving the automatic grade calculation in place is often the way things are done. If there's no way to tell, I could make a single-submission popup grading interface that would offer the option to mark the automatic submission grade as OK (using a separate DB table) so that it would be removed from the total to mark and you could keep track. Would this be useful? All thoughts and comments appreciated!",

          "Text": "Hi Matt. Thanks for your contribution. I believe that the Real Teachers using Workshop module will provide you with valuable feedback on how they use it in their classes. I'm just adding my point of view here. I would personally expect that only submissions explicitly allocated to the current $USER are displayed in the block. It seems that in most workshops, teachers do not assess all submissions (for various reasons, typically because there are just too many of them). They just pick some of them randomly. Note the list of submissions can become really long - dozens of submissions are not an exception. What about just some stats (number of expected vs number of already submitted) in the same way as the Workshop planner tool provides? Leaving this for others to comment on, no personal opinion here. Correct, there is no \"lock\" feature at the moment where the teacher would mark the calculated grade as correct. The idea is that the teacher evaluates the assessments until they are happy and then they just leave the grades as-is and switch to the Close phase (in which moment, grades are written into the Gradebook). If there was a demand for this feature, I would rather see it implemented natively in the Workshop (eg. via tagging or a flag in mdl_workshop_submissions table). Let us see.",

          "Text": "I've been using Workshop for a couple of semesters now, but this summer is my first really intensive use of the newly designed module. I'm relatively familiar with the features but have been re-reading the documentation to fine-tune my understanding. In re-reading the section on \"grading strategies,\" I saw in the section on Comments that it talks about using Workshop for repetitive workflows: first draft of a paper just gets comments, for example. Then, as I understand it, I move the workshop back to submission phase, possibly changing the grading strategy to Rubric or Accumulative Grading, and then run the workshop again. Am I understanding this correctly so far? My main question is this: if I wish to \"document\" the work done on an assignment, is it wise to use repetitive workflows? Does resetting things wipe out the prior assessment work done? If students resubmit a revised draft, does that overwrite the previous draft? On the one hand, it would be nice to use one Workshop for an entire assignment, but what I have been doing is to use Workshop for the rough draft stage (using Rubric and Accumulative Grading as my preferred strategies--still deciding which I like best), and then creating a separate Assignment for them to submit their final draft, which only I grade--using a rubric that I've created for that Assignment. This has worked pretty well for me, and I do have a record of both the rough draft they submitted (and its assessments) as well as the final draft of the same paper. I'm curious if anyone has tried combining these steps into a single Workshop, or if anyone has tips on how they've used Workshop in assignment sequences.",

This way, the workshop will be available only to users who are members of the grouping's groups.

I agree we must be able to produce them somehow so they can be post-processed statistically. However, we must provide a general solution for all types of the grading forms in the Workshop. What I was thinking about was a unified format that would output the filled grading forms data as normalized values. What all grading forms have in common (regardless whether it is Rubric, Accumulative or whatever) is that they all consists of a set of assessment dimensions. The filled assessment is internally converted to a value from 0 to 100%. We could generate such report. So while data for the filled rubric would contain columns with values like 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00 (in case of a rubric with 5 columns), the Number of errors (Error banded in 1.x) would produce just one column with either 0.00 or 1.00 - depending on what the reviewer (grader) said.",

In my current settings of a workshop the course setting \"separate groups\" is set.  Although for the tutors assigned to \"their\" groups \"accessallgroups\" is set to deny (works fine for i.g. forum) every teacher gets a list of ~600 submissions - this is difficult to handle. Is there a possibility to configure a workshop to reduce the list of submissions to only the tutor's participants? kind regards Herbert Plass",

It might be solvable via a new setting \"Automatically embed attached images\". At the moment, Workshop automatically embeds them (like Forum does). If you think it might be useful for others too, please report it as a new feature request. The alternative solution (which I would actually prefer) is a general in-core (ie not Workshop specific) feature that big images would be automatically scaled to a preview-sized version like eg MediaWiki does. Such a feature might be useful for other places dealing with images (Forum, Assignment). Chances are it is already reported.",

We would like to use Moodle and workshop module instead of in-house system. There are at least two big problems: 1) There is no automatic switching from one phase to another. Why one can give time limits for ending submissions and for starting assesments, but system does not automatically move to next phase? 2) Students need extra time sometimes (due to sickness etc.). Even with ignore deadlines -tag they can not submit their work when system has been switched to assesment phase. Is workshop module used in big courses? If, how are these two problems solved?",

Someone should probably assess late submissions - meaning that they have to be allocated for assessment. But once you allow extra time for submitting, you must allow extra time for assessment. And because we need all assessments done for the calculation of final grades, late submissions effectively block all workshop participants... That is why even late submissions obey the phase of the workshop and therefore the availability of the individual deadlines was not seen as important.",

The main Workshop setting form is independent on the current phase so you should have all settings available there. There is intentionally no way how to override the aggregated grade for assessment within the workshop. What you can do is to override a partial grade for a single assessment. But the overall grade for assessments is calculated as a mean of grades for all given assessments. Alternatively, you can override the grade in the course Gradebook once the grades are pushed there. There is no way how to publish all assessments at once at the moment. Because Workshop was considered as an advanced variant of the Assignment module, the submission is considered to be private. The publishing feature is there so the teacher can publish the exemplary work by individual students. If you want all submissions to be published, you may use some another module (like a Database or Forum) for submitting and use Workshop for the peer-assessment only (instead of providing full text, your student would submit just a link to their work submitted elsewhere at a public place). p.s. please create separate discussion thread per each issue, it will help to keep track of it.

For example, if someone needs a sophisticated way how to allocate submissions according to overall students' performance so that excellent students assess only other excellent students while poor students assess other students etc, they ccan develop their own allocation subplugin. It is like in the Quiz - when editing the Quiz settings, you do not define the questions because questions are independent on the Quiz.",

I can see that you would prefer legacy behaviour when everything is set and defined in advance and then workshop just runs without much teacher's input needed. But the new version was developed so that these tools are interactive and can be combined in many ways. For example, you can let Random allocator do some initial random assignments and tweak it using the Manual allocation tool. Or vice versa, define several required allocations (like a teacher really wants to assess John's and Mary's submissions personally) and let all other being allocated randomly. Or, when the grades for assessment are calculated, the teacher is expected to iteratively play with the setting, changing the weights, overriding the calculated values etc. until they are happy with the overall result. From this point of view, it is very natural to have the setting form available just in time when they are needed and not before.",

In details, there are some orphaned grade records in your 1.9 workshop table that are not linked with any assessment. You can fix it by direct access to your database only. You should fix your database before you start the upgrade to 2.0. Of course, I assume it is still your test site and you have full backup of your production environment. Firstly, lauch your favourite MySQL client and run \n```text\nmysql> SELECT * FROM mdl_workshop_grades WHERE assessmentid IS NULL;\n```\n That will probably give you some results - those orphaned grades without the assessment. You can delete them with \n```text\nmysql> DELETE FROM mdl_workshop_grades WHERE assessmentid IS NULL;\n```\n That should not influence your workshops as the orphaned grades are not owned by any user.",

I have analysed your database and there are inconsistencies between workshop_grades and workshop_assessments tables. One of your assessment record was somehow removed but the linked grades remained and that threw the upgrade record. To find those orphaned grades record you can use \n```text\nSELECT g.id, g.assessmentid\nFROM mdl_workshop_grades g\nLEFT JOIN mdl_workshop_assessments a ON g.assessmentid = a.id\nWHERE a.id IS NULL;\n```\n and it will give you eight grade records that refer to a non-existing assessment. I am going to patch the upgrade code in workshop so that it handles this case as well. So either you can remove those grades manually or wait for tomorrow's Moodle 2.0 build to test again with. By the way, I have spotted yet another upgrade problem in MNet thanks to your dump - thank you for it!",

Many sites did not have any real workshops and then it is better to uninstall the workshop module from your 1.9 server before you start the upgrade. Anyway, the thrown problem indicates problems in your database integrity. Particularly, there are some workshop module instances without the corresponding course_module record. This might happen as a result of some problems with restoring a course in the past, for example. To make sure that is your case please run the following query at your 1.9 database (before the upgrade attempt) and let me know the result: \n```text\n    SELECT w.id,w.name,w.course\n      FROM mdl_workshop w\n LEFT JOIN mdl_course_modules cm\n           ON cm.module=(SELECT id FROM mdl_modules WHERE name='workshop') AND cm.instance=w.id\n     WHERE cm.id IS NULL;\n```",

In that case I do a teacher assessment. It means that when I go to calculate the final grade some students have teacher assessment and others do not. My understanding that the forumla calculating student's submission grade ignores the lack of a teacher assessment and the student grade would be, for example, the average of the 3 student assessments.

It's my understanding then that the faculty member shouldn't try to design a situation where their assessment is weighted with those of peer reviewers. Rather it seems far simpler to allow student peers to evaluate, and then as faculty to review and over-ride as judged appropriate with comment. This way the faculty member doesn't have to submit an essay or post of the assignment itself and then manually over-ride random allocations to be qualified as a rater for each class member. I can surely live with that! I wonder if there would ever be a way of rigging the system up to allow a manager or faculty member to 'submit' on behalf of students. I'm just thinking how one could use this tool for peer assessment of performance. In this case the trigger is not an essay or post, but something more along the lines of evaluating the person's contribution. If some stock words could comprise the submission, then assessment scales could be devised (support, teamwork, leadership,etc.) for offline performance assessment with all the virtues of considering the peer rating as well as the pattern of ratings.",

I can even imagine a new allocation method (that is a third card at the Allocation page) that randomly picks N given submissions and allocates them to the current user (or any other given user). This way, workshop with 50 students could run in a classic peer-review mode and the teacher could just randomly pick 5 or 7 submissions to check. Submitting on behalf students is possible with the standard \"login as\" feature. However I think that the teacher can just ask all students to simply upload a very short information (like their team name or even their own name or so) just to register them in the workshop. And yes - you are right - since then, you can actually assess anything, not only the submission itself.",

          "Text": "Hi Caryl, I may have a suspicion what is going on here. In Workshop 1.x, whenever a submission is allocated to be reviewed by a peer (which is done automatically and nobody can control that much), a new assessment record is created in the database and its timecreated flag is set one year into the future to signalize that this assessment has not been completed yet by the peer. That is obviously very strange design. Unfortunately, Workshop 1.x code is full of such things and that is why it was rewritten completely from scratch for Moodle 2.0. Anyway back to your problem. I think that after the year the workshop suddenly finds these assessment records and it considers them as assessed because the time created is not in the future any more. So it sends the email to the author that their submission has been assessed even though nobody even started to assess the work. Can you please confirm that this explanation would fit your case? Can you check the dates to see if it happened one year later after the workshop?",

          "Text": "Oh, I'm sorry Vernellia - I must have missed your post somehow! Yes, I remember this feature request. As I said before, it basically depends on whether you use the same strategy for both forms or not. If you use one strategy for the first form (eg comments) and another strategy for the second form (eg accumulative), you can prepare them in advance already. Workshop supports strategy switching so that you can use one form to assess example submissions and then switch the strategy. If you use the same strategy for both example submissions assessments and peer submissions assessments, you have to modify the assessment form during the workshop run. Workshop can not hold two instances of the same type assessment form at the moment (like one Choice does not support two different sets of selection items). So you have to modify the assessment form after the example submissions are assessed. Alternatively, you could use two workshop instances - one for the pre-submission assessment and the second for the real one. Sorry, I can't promise any specific fix version for your request. But I would like to address it in some future version, for sure. It is clear that workshop will need some better management of assessment forms. At first, export/import functionality is needed (imho) to allow re- usability of assessment forms in other workshops. We may even think of sort of Assessment forms bank like Question bank we have. I hope that would help you with your issue, too.",

I understand that it can do a number of things, including peer-assessment, self-assessment, rubric assessment, often in combination with each other. One application we are hoping to use it for is straight rubric marking, without necessarily involving student assessment. However, when I try to simulate this situation, there seems to be a few screens that are expecting the peer assessment to have been turned on (even though I had it unticked). For instance, there is the 'Override mark' screen, which is really meant to be the teacher overriding the student-assessed mark. However, this shouldn't be visible, as the teacher would only be overriding their own mark in my situation! Also, if I change the assessment split from 80/20 to 100/0, then go through the motions of assessment as a teacher, the grade doesn't seem to flow through to the gradebook - only zeros are given. So, I guess I'm just wondering if I'm misunderstanding something. Is the workshop module flexible enough to NOT utilise the peer/self assessment component and still work? I fully understand the benefits of having the peer assessment component (I'm not saying it is not worth using), I'm just wondering about using the workshop to allow rubric marking - as there doesn't appear to be anything else in Moodle that allows this without implementing something like Lightwork.",

          "Text": "Hi Michael, your request makes perfect sense and using Workshop 2.0 in such situation was one of the use cases I had when designing it. The checkbox \"Use peer-assessment\" is available as a fresh new feature but it is not taken into account too much yet. I mean - user interface does not depend on it (yet) so some irrelevant features (like the overriding you mentioned or the columns in the workshop grades report) are still visible. The plan is that Workshop without peer-assessment feature would behave similarly to the Assignment module while still offering the advanced grading methods like rubrics. The development was focused on mainstream usage of Workshop though so this will not happen in 2.0, sorry. But, I am pretty sure you can use Workshop in 2.0 for your situation:\n* Just set the maximum grade for assessment to zero\n* Set the course gradebook so that it ignores and hides workshop grade for assessment item from your students completely\n* Skip submission allocation - you as the teacher can assess all submissions by default and they are allocated to you automatically once you press the \"Assess\" button, without the need to use allocator.\n* Do not fill instructions for assessments so they are not displayed to your students The reason why I want to wait for wider feedback from the community before I start hiding various bits of UI is that your situation is just one of use cases we must count with. Imagine for example there are hundreds of submissions in the workshop and you have some assistants (non-editing teachers, mentors etc) that help you with assessing. In this case it is not clean peer assessment as normal students just submit their work (authors) while the other group of users (reviewers) assess them. The master teacher could want to calculate grades for assessments for the assistants to see how relevant their assessment is. In this case, you still want to see peer-assessment features (for example the master teacher wants to override the grade given by their assistants) even if students do not go through peer-assessment phase. Sure, you will not probably give feedback to yourself at the bottom of the assessment form. But you may want to use the field for your own notes maybe? And maybe you can run into situation when you do not agree with the grade calculated by the rubric and will want to modify it a bit - for example because the assessed student has some disabilities you as the human can respect while the blindly objective rubric can not. Summary: workshop should be flexible enough for your need if you can live with the fact you may be offered some options you do not want to use at the given scenario. Hope this explains the reasons a bit - looking forward for your comments and thoughts!",

If I were you, I would try to analyse what was done wrong during the upgrade. Make and archive the backup of your database and PHP sources. Anyway, your current issue with the workshop should be fixed by downloading the recent 1.9.7+ Moodle files and uploading them to your site (overwriting the current code). Then visit your site administration page to finish the procedure.",

          "Text": "Two of my students have gotten this error message.  I'm not sure why.  There had been 3 teacher submissions for them to do their practice assessessments on.  They had done those, submitted their own work- and then assessed it. Now, they can't get back into the Workshop module.  I've even tried deleting a student from the class and re-enrolling them.  Same issue. I do not have adminstrative access, but if I had a little more information about what could be done in such a situation. I might feel ok about bothering the adminstrator who is basically a volunteer, at this point. This particular issue pretty much looks like a bug, but I'm too unfamiliar with Moodle to say. Separate issue probably: In my first workshop I think I made a mistake allowing students to assess each others' work.  I did not check \"Make Assessments Agree\", but students are having a hard time seeing my comments on line.  Printing them out is very unsatisfactory too as the page gets cut off.  This relatively annoying glitch (probably of my own creation, somehow) could well be related to other assessment issues. If a student has done a \"Self Assessment\" of their own work and I go in to do the Teacher's Assessment (I am 99.9% sure I am clicking the right link) I often see their assessment with the \"Assessment by _Student Name_\" on top.  If I \"jiggle\" it (Click \"Add Comment\" or go back and click the same link again) I will see the header \"Assessment by _My Name_\" now but often the students own comments are still there.  (I am 99.9% sure that I know the difference between entering my own assessment and \"Grading\" a student's assessment of sample work or their own work.\" Next month I am going to try a workshop with the Peer Assessments  option turned off.  Maybe that will clear up most or all of the assessment issues.   I'm hoping there is a way of avoiding or redressing the workshop_list_teacher_submissions: unable to get submission issue. Or, am I in over my head? Thanks",

It used to be OK as in the dark past, no Roles and Capabilities monsters ruled the Moodle Earth. However, these days we do not use thes hardcoded role names any more and we talk about users, participants etc. where possible. In the new Workshop, there is a set of capabilities (granted to the legacy Teacher role by default) that allow things like overriding peer grades, reviewing and assessing any submission, being able to always see all participants' names (if the reviewing process is anonymous for regular peers) etc. I am looking for a good word for such \"power user\". I call then \"supergraders\" meanwhile but maybe (certainly!) you can find a better name. Such word is needed in a situation like this: typically, the teachers will be able to assess any submission they like even it has not been allocated to them. It is possible to increase a weight of such teacher's assessment. How shall we call the setting if we want to avoid strings like \"Weight of teacher's assessment\" in order not to use the word \"teacher\"?",

What I mean is I would like to have students working on things and when they get to a certain point in the course they submit their work for marking. Their peers can mark it and give comments but I still want other students to be able to submit assignments so I want to be able to run submitting and assessing side by side, at the same time. Is this possible? Up till now I seem to have to have work submitted and then I can set an assessment timeframe after I have had them submit it but not both at the same time. Thanks Dave",

          "Text": "Can the Workshop module be used (abused) to facilitate peer assessment of work in a semester-long group/team project? Personal background: Still somewhat new to Moodle (only used it for one full semester, preparing for a second semester). Haven't used the workshop module yet. Haven't done team projects in class before. Looking for ways to make the process of in-group peer assessment easier. Teaching Context : This is for a large (170 students) introductory-level course in cultural anthropology at Concordia University, in Montreal. Typically, Concordia students are used to a fair amount of autonomy and don't expect much hand-holding or spoon-feeding. Project: A semester-long ethnography project on a specific social group (music fanclub, hobby group, religious community, etc.). The project has four parts: a project proposal, an observation report, an interview report, and a final paper. Grading: My criteria for grading the assignments include such things as insight, originality, and honesty. All things which are relatively easy to use while grading and quite robust across semesters but pretty difficult to transmit to others. My use of peer assessment would have more to do with factors influencing teamwork. It's easy for me to relate to comments made by Roger Arango about group projects and group grading .",

Two possible ways for your ideas: 1.) Use a forum 1 for small groupe discussion (seperate groups) They have to post their solutions in forum 2 (ask them to structure it in the postings), first seperate groups, then change to visible groups now all may see these postings and may browse through them Let them find differences, new ideas and so on ... If you would like to give them the possibilities to POST, then you have to use the no groups solution. To show the different groups, use nthe possibility to show groupe-pictures. Then they have to continue the discussion in Forum 1 with the new inputs and have to complete their own work (seperate groups) each group has to post ONE solution in a forum 3, which first has seperate groups and then change to no groups Now they may comment and rank they solutions. for this process you may use a WIKI in a groupe-mode to support the writings. Take care - that they show you they process of discussion and not only the solution. this prevents solutions, which may be written in view hours or days befor the end 2. If you would like to use the workshop modul you have to use several workshopmoduls: Each groupe has to post the solution in one of the moduls (ONCE). You have to decide before, which groupe should post in which modul and should do the peers in another modul. Now all Students may peer - assess the uploaded works in predefined workshop moduls and you can be sure, they will not get their own work as a peer. For your situation i would recomand the Nr. 1 Hope that helps Peter",

          "Text": "Apologies for the misunderstandings. Members of each team will work on the team's project, producing one \"assignment\" per team per stage in the project (e.g., each team submits one project plan, one observation report, etc.). Those teams are separate groups in the Moodle class (taken at random, working as a team throughout the semester). As both the instructor and the grader, I'll make the assessment of the team's output (the \"assignments\" themselves) using those difficult-to-transmit criteria that I mentioned. Students will not peer-assess the quality of the assignments (e.g., observation report) submitted for the teams' projects. The peer assessment comes in as a regulatory system to diminish the impact of \"freeriders,\" \"leechers,\" or \"hitchhikers.\" My idea is to have the members of each group assess the degree of participation by their fellow team members based on criteria on which they will agree, as teams. As much as possible, I want to use the averages of those grades to serve as a differentiating factor for the grades of different members of the team in cases where there are noticeable discrepancies in terms of individual participation within the team. So, if a given team receives 41/45 on the project overall but three of the four team members describe the participation of the fourth member as insufficient (giving her, say, an average of 5/10 for participation), I want this fourth member's lack of participation to be represented in her overall project grade (20.5/45 instead of 41/45). The alternative would be to have a separate participation grade, the consequences of which aren't as harsh, but it might not serve as a sufficient regulatory mechanism. I would prefer to have these evaluations made at every step of the process but, if the in-team peer assessment system can't be embedded in the \"assignments\" in Moodle, it will probably not be possible for me to implement such a cumbersome structure on 170 students. The course should not become \"busy work\" for anyone. Reading Peter's answer, I have been thinking about other solutions. I eventually received a reply telling me that I can use a peer-assessment online database system made by a fellow Concordia teacher. It might work better that way. I just thought that the Workshop module could work to add a layer of peer assessment to the existing group structure. Thanks a lot for your kind help!",

Can the workshop module be used for students to only assess members of their separate (not visible) Moodle groups? Can the peer assessment be free-form? Can I receive peer-assessments from all team members about all the other team members? Can those assessments be anonymous for assessors? What is the result of the peer-assessment project within Moodle grades? Hypothetical example: Jane, Isabel, Hawa, and William do a project on the Straight Edge Punk movement in Montreal. They submit their observation report (under Hawa's name). I grade that observation report as 9/10, giving them feedback about the project as a whole. The four of them submit a \"reflection paper\" in which they assess their own participation. Each team member rates the reflection papers by the three others (e.g., Isabel gives Hawa 10/10, William 6/10, and Jane 8/10). For each team member, I get grades that I can average out and then multiply by the grade for the observation report (if Hawa gets an average of 10/10 from fellow team members, she gets the full 9/10, if Isabel gets an average of 8/10 from peer assessment, she gets 7.2/10). If all of this can be done, it might be a relatively good solution as it really engages students in thinking about their team participation. (I also have a two engagement grades for the course as a whole, one of which is self-assessed.) I'm guessing that the identity of the assessors will always be known (e.g., Isabel will know how Hawa assessed her participation). It might not be ideal, but it would still work. Is there a test course where I could try this out? Thanks a lot!",

It seems that the workshop module could work for my needs but I would have needed to learn more about it before using it. Maybe next time. In lieu of the WS module, I'll be using a Concordia-designed peer assessment system meant specifically for teamwork. It already has a team participation structure and useful reporting features. Maybe the WS module itself or another Moodle module could be designed specifically for team projects. The group structure already in place can be very useful and the available modules can be used for group activities , but the connection between pedagogy and technology also implies other issues with which Moodle seems like the perfect tool.

However, the disadvantage is that some students will not have their full quota of submissions to assess until AFTER the last student has submitted their work .\" Have all the students submitted their own work? Or are submissions still coming in? Obviously, a submission cannot be peer-assessed until its submission is complete. I assume submission is complete when either (1) the End of submissions date/time is reached or (2) the work is submitted and Allow resubmission = No. These are simply some ideas to think about.

The thing is that students have a period of time (I think it's 30 minutes) after they post their submission, to edit it or to delete it, in case they want to change something. In my experience, I've noticed that those submissions don't appear anywhere to be assessed in that period (well, in fact those submissions appear if you are the administrator, but the other students can't see it). It can also be something about the cron job, but I think it's more because of what I said earlier. Try leaving a gap of 30 minutes (at least) between the end of submissions deadline and start of assessments. I know it's annoying when you are trying with experimental workshops, but it's the only way to get it working correctly. I hope this helps you Xabi",

          "Text": "Hello, I'm trying to read from the moodle database the grades achieved by the students in a certain workshop. I think the best way (at least it seems the least complicated) is to read the 'finalgrade' field of the \"mdl_workshop_submissions\" table. I tried with some experimental workshops, and I discovered that this field is never written, even if the 'release grades' line is crossed. Is it an error of my workshops or is that the normal functioning? What could I do so that moodle writes the 'finalgrade' field with the values it calculates when, for example, shows the califications of all the stundets? Thank you for your help! Xabier",

I was just informed by a student that some students felt that they were able to deduce who assessed a prior assignment (our first workshop) based on comparing the time of assessment (shown to them in the workshop tool) and the last time that people logged in (displayed on the list of participants/people for each class). I am using a hosted account (Bluehost) but I DO have access to each file on my section of the server and so I can edit a .php or other file if I know where to look and what to change. The version is Moodle 1.6.1 I'm feeling guilty that this is so old but when I tried to upgrade to 1.7 I had some problems due to some issues with course backups. I have since then corrected the backup issues but I am in the middle of a term and would prefer to wait until our next break to upgrade. Thanks in advance, Daniel",

Unfortunately, they seem to occasionally conclude that it is easier to use their metal facilities to find shortcuts rather than just learn the material (Human Anatomy and Physiology). Is it possible to just omit displaying the peer assessment timestamp? That would allow students to see that their submission was assessed, and possibly the date it was assessed on, but NOT the time that it was assessed. I think that would solve the issue for most workshop configurations as the timestamp information would still be logged for system and administrator use but not displayed to students. Thanks, Daniel",

I don't want to have to have the guests log on to be able to sign up for a course and I need to be able to keep track of who is in the courses.  Is this even possible?  Any direction on my next step would be apprecaited.  Thanks.",

          "Text": "This discussion thread is primarily for a module/tool that is called the Workshop. I think that you are primarily interested in how to control enrollment into classes. The newer versions of Moodle allow you to use SSL/shttp and have a variety of enrollment options. I think that Paypal is available as an enrollment option since Moodle 1.6. Your best bet is to go to the Enrollment Plugins discussion and read what has already been posted. Here is a list of the steps you would need to take for Moodle version 1.7 (mostly from memory of setting up the authorize.net enrollment option <-- so some may be wrong) 1) get the certificate for your cite so that SSL will work 2) verify SSl by trying to access a file via https 3) turn on https by going to Administration -> security -> HTTP security and checking the box associated with \"use https for logins\" (If you can not login at this point you had better hope that you have access to the moodle database of your site so that you can reset that checkmark! Information about how to do this IS available in the discussion forums here at moodle.org) 4) Go to Administration ->Courses -> Enrolments (<-yes, for some reason Moodlers spell it with just one \"l\" must be a Southern Hemisphere thing!?!) and then select the enrollment options you want to use and configure them. 5) I haven't used the PayPal enrollment option but I am assuming it is similar to the authorize.net enrollment. If so, go to the actual virtual classroom (or create one and then input the payment information in the settings for the course.) At the end of this list I realize that I do not know if you need SSL/https for paypal - if not then many of the above steps will be un-necessary. Moodle allows you to use multiple enrollment options and so if you want to have some people pay with PayPal, other with VISA/MC/AmEX,etc, and others via passcode that they enter --> you can do it.",

In particular we are going to need to know more detail about what you want to do with audio. Are you just wanting to post audio for students or are you wanting to have students be able to post audio also? Is it acceptable to require students to download the audio file (very easy and flexible - just attach the audio files) or do you want the audio to stream from the web page? (not very hard use the multimedia filters). Do you require the audio to be organized into a threaded discussion? If so, check into Gong for Moodle, MoodleSpeex, or Yackpack (not really integrated into Moodle but it can give the appearance of being integrated). Cheers and keep moodling.",

Just one mark to be awarded at the moment, so no need for multiple criteria etc but I keep getting errors. When students try to assess their own work, they see \"Could not insert workshop assessment.\" I have tried some of the fixes on here and they help a bit but it's still buggy. Surely the latest version of workshop would have fixed this? I am on 1.7+ Students cannot see the work of other students. Do they only see these after the submission deadline is passed? Some people mentioned that sufficient time must pass between submission and assessment. Is this true? Does this mean I cannot have students answering a question in class and then marking it in the same hour? I am probably being stupid but I have read Ch6 of the manual and all the help popups but am really stuck. Is there something that I might be doing wrong? I have tried criterion and accumulative grading, 1 comment, no attachments (it is going to be typed in the browser), no resubmissions, fair comparison, 2 student assessments, over allocation = 1. Any help very gratefully received! David",

If your students can write the sections in separate windows, the Form assignment type might do the trick; it allows you to grade the sections separately (I'm not sure this one works in 1.6.x). For inline corrections and comments in the book reports I would use the online text assignment type (and add to the feedback or to the assignment description my assessment criteria). Rgrds, Paul.",

Secondly there is the possibility to hide the grades before the agreement. So group members only see the written feedback they have got (if you are working with written feedback...). As far as I know it is not possible to hide the scores, as the aim of a peer assessment is to exchange feedback, to reflect on other working papers. Hope you got some new ideas!",

The problem is that if I grade Student X's submission as 90/90 and Student X has also completed a peer assessment (which I score 10/10) BUT no one has assessed Student X's submission, Student X ends up with like 99.6 instead of the full 100 pts I think s/he deserves for doing work.  I know this is because the 90/90 score I give Student X is averaged by the score that Student X's work was peer-assessed at. Looks like if there is no peer assessment it defaults to a ZERO, causing the artifically lower score. Is this just a bug or oversight?",

(also 12+12 and 6+12) I know I can use accumulative grade/rubric and weighting to acieve this, but it's messy and I'd rather not as I am trying to get them to use the exam board markscheme, which basically supplies a rubric for marking. Trouble is, the workshop rubrics only go from 1-5 and I can't seem to define custom scales for accumulative. Does anyone know of a hack I can apply to increase the rubrics from 5 up to 15? It would be a lifesaver! Matt",

          "Title": "Teacher Assessment not being reflected",
          "Text": "I have been using the workshop module since April of this year (2005), and am very impressed with the new version, which is part of moodle 1.5.2. However, I am having a problem understanding the grading system. In particular, it is not clear to me how the 'Teacher Assessment' of a piece of work is reflected in the 'Submission Grade'. At the moment I am having students get into groups of 4 or 5 students. Each group of students has its own username and password. The groups upload work to the workshop, and assess their own work as well as that of other groups using their group IDs. This all works fine: each group grades its own group's work, plus that of 4 or 5 other groups. I then grade each group's work. The settings for the Workshop are as follows: Grade for Assessments: 30 Grade for Submission: 70 Grading Strategy: Accumulative Number of Comments, Assessment Elements, Grade Bands, Criterion Statments or Categories in a Rubric: 18 Number of Attachments expected on Submissions: 0 Allow Resubmissions: No Number of Assessments of Examples from Teacher: 0 Comparison of Assessments: Lax Number of Assessments of Student Submissions: 4 Weight for Teacher Assessments: 4 Over Allocation: 0 Self Assessment: Yes Assessments must be agreed: Yes The problem is that my score (the Teacher Assessment) is not reflected in the 'Submission Grade'. The only part of the grade in which my score is reflected is in the 'Assessment Grade', and therefore to a certain extent in the 'Total Grade'. I know this, because if I change the 'Comparison of Assessments' to, for example 'strict', the change is reflected in the Assessment Grade by a change in the groups' 'Assessment Grade' and 'Total Grade'. I understand that one of the purposes of the 'Teacher Assessment' grade is to provide a 'benchmark' with which to compare students' grades of those of their peers. However, it would also seem to be the case that the 'Teacher Assessement' score should also be part of the 'Submission Grade'. Yet, changes in the 'Weight for Teacher Assessments' do not make any difference what so ever to the 'Submission Grade'. I realise that I could increase the influence of my grade on the 'Total Grade' by increasing the 'Grade for Assessments' and decreasing the 'Grade for Submission', coupled with making the 'Comparison of Assessments' 'Very Strict'. However, I would prefer to make my grade (the Teacher Assessment') have a more direct and transparent effect on the 'Total Grade'. In other words, I want to place more emphasis on the the students' submissions than their ability to assess. I have attached a PDF of the 'League Table of Submitted Work' showing all the grades for the 10 groups that I mentioned above. You'll see, for example, that a 'groups' 'Submission' grade is the average of the 'Peer Assessments' that have been agreed to. The Teacher's Assessment is not reflected in this score at all. I realise that the Workshop module is currently in search of a maintainer, so I may not got an answer to this query. However, I'd welcome any suggestions or comments from other Workshop users, even if it is just to say that you have also experienced this 'problem'. Or, indeed, if it is just to say that I have misunderstood something. Thank you.",

However, I don't seem to be hitting the right combination of options to bring the assessment to students. I tried setting the course as not using groups or using visible groups.

In Moodle a \"group\" is really like a separate section of the same course, so multiple sections can be running in parallel using the same course set up but without (necessarily - it depends on how you set things up) being aware of the other groups.  Within a Moodle group everyone has to do every assignment and there's no support for team projects like (I think) you describe.

          "Text": "As part of a directed study in PHP and MySQL , my professor, Nic McPhee, and I have been looking to solve what is, in our opinion, a bug in the Workshop module that causes some students, generally those who submit later, to never be assigned the proper amount of peer assessments.  This is, in our opinions, an unacceptable flaw in the module.  First off, this bug means that somebody won't get the proper amounts of the reviews that they should get, but most importantly, this means that if you are the student that does not receive enough submissions to do, then your grade will be affected negativity because you couldn't do the proper amount of assessments.  Basically you would be penalized for submitting later that everybody, even though you have submitted to the workshop on-time. After a week of searching, we finally found the code that this takes place.  What we originally considered the bug was a single if statement.  We discovered that if we commented it out, then the proper amount of assessments would appear for all of the students.  However, we soon realized that removing the if statement all together could result in a new and perhaps larger problem. It appeared that the new problem could result in a student who would end up not only having no assessments to assess, but also that nobody would assess their work. Consider a class with five people, the amount of peer assessments have been set to 3, the amount of overassessments has been set to zero (or in our logic, eliminated alltoghether), and also consider that the workshop is set up so that the start of the assessments period is the same as the start of the submissions period (i.e., set so that students can begin to do peer assessments as soon as they have submitted their work).  Students A, B, C, and D are prompt and submit their work as soon as the workshop allows them to and then they continue to promptly do their peer assessments. This chart shows that: Student A assesses B, C, D. Student B assesses A, C, D. Student C assesses A, B, D. Student D assesses A, B, C.",

          "Text": "I am using workshop with a group of the 9th grade students in my mathematics course. Usually I stay in Phase 2 for students to submit their assignments only till all assignments are submitted. Then I switch to Phase 4 for students to assess a number of homework. in this phase, when an assessment is sent out and arrived, the assessed student can view the content of assessment immediately. That is, before the saved assessment is viewed, the student assessor can \"edit\" the content of his assessment, but if the assessment is viewed, the content can only be viewed instead of editing anymore. The problem is, sometimes students just do not finish their evaluation yet and save their assessment, or they want to improve their content or modify some part of the saved assessment. They found they can not edit it anymore cause the assessment has been viewed. They come to me and ask me to let them go on editing. However, I don't have the right to do it but can only tell the student assessor: well, if you made some mistakes in your assessment but you can not modify it any more, please just tell that student directly.\" Is it possible for the teacher to own the right (to press a button or set up a deadline for assessment)  for students to read their assessment? If so, student assessors will have a period of time to articulate what they've assessed and modify it if necessary. Cheers, Laura",

The Workshop interface to the student is similar to uploaded Assignment: a box for browsing a file with a button for uploading.  Try logging in as a student (add a dummy student if you like) and have a look. Also, the Workshop interface has been subtantially modified in 1.5, so that you set begin and end dates for submissions and assessments, rather than selecting tabs. Hope your workshop works out OK.

So, I think my question is... Can I use a workshop to setup rubrics for students to view and for me as a teacher to use as an evaluative tool, or is there a better option? If there is not, do others agree that a 'rubric' tool, whereby teachers could set up the rubric with the different criteria, weights, grading options, and a place for feedback would be valuable?  For me it would be amazing.  All of my evaluation takes place through rubrics of projects.  I would LOVE for students to upload their project or provide a link to their project and then complete a rubric that students can view online (complete with the grade entered, etc.) Any thoughts on this?

I have submitted the changes to CVS . The teacher now gets a table with all submissions and assessments straight on the main page of the workshop and by clicking on the table entries can view and mark. The table can be sorted by clicking on the table headings. I believe that the old administration page is no longer needed but I have nevertheless provided a link to it so people can compare. I have also changed some internal workings. For example teacher assessments are now used as soon as they are submitted to recalculate the grades and they also immediately show up in the table. In the old days the teacher had to wait until the end of the editing period before his changes were reflected on the administration page. There are countless little tweaks. For example the assessment page now have a resizable frame at the bottom where one can view the submission that is being assessed. That makes for a lot less scrolling up and down the page. Also after viewing or marking a submission or assessment one is returned to the appropriate place in the grade table rather than to the top. Of course I may have introduced may bugs. The workshop module is rather versatile and therefore it is difficult to test it exhaustively. Please let me know if you notice anything strange.",

Instead it automatically assigns a mark to the assessments based on how close their mark is to the average mark for the submission. In practice this has the very undesirable effect that the careful students who pick up errors in a submission that the majority overlook get low mark for their assessments whereas the lazy students who simply mark at random without giving any feedback get very high marks. So I want to go back to marking the assessments myself. Would it be difficult to put the old marking code back? Why did you take it out in the first place? I can see that it may be convenient to have the automatic marking, but why not have both side by side: automatic marking with the option for the teacher to overrride it?",

We used to do this by hand but had a set of rules locally to make it consistent. This session I kinda converted those rules into the auto grading of assessments and then ported it into the Workshop module as well. It's a bit experimental (and controversal) but it was introduced to avoid the horrendous grading load I have in my courses. In one I've got 50 students doing 6 assessments in a couple of workshops. In another course I've got 500 students doing 7 assessments in a workshop. Thus the need for some sort of automation. But it's good to make it an option. I did have some code to override the grading grade. I think it's gone now because there were circumstances when the automatic grading routine would just go in later and reset it. Perhaps that facility, if it were made watertight, would be useful. I think the code is still in Exercise (as here two assessments is only compared once) but not in Workshop (as here the same two assessments can be compared many times).",

          "Text": "This version brings the Workshop module closer to both the original assignment module and the exercise module. When the workshop module is used for a simple assignment (see the attached file) it now makes no reference to student assessments and their grades (there were zeros in a few of the tables). The assignment is very like the original assignment module but with fancy assessment forms and optional attachments. The assignment is in three phases/stages - Set up where the assessment form is created; Student submissions where students submit work and the teacher grades it; and Closed where the optional league table of best submissions can be displayed. To make the module closer to the Exercise module I've added an optional password and the flagging of late submissions. Also an exercise-like workshop only has three phases (like the simple assignment workshop) as opposed to the \"standard\" five phases when peer assessment is involved. (There's a new internal flag which is used to switch various bits on and off depending on the \"type\" of the workshop being run, again see the attachment for a few more details.) It certainly needs a bit of field testing but the module is  showing better \"scaling\" now. Simple assignments are beginning to look simple and the more complicated assignments switch on extra features.",

So, I went ahead and changed the Number of assessments of students submissions to 2 (thinking one for their self-assessment plus one for their peer), and that fixed the problem: they each were given the other student's paper to evaluate. Ok, great.  But... the help information on \"Self Assessment\" indicates that it shouldn't work that way: \"A workshop assignment can optionally include the student's own work in the set of pieces each student is asked to assess. This will mean that if, say, the number of student pieces of work each student has to assess is set at 5, then each student will be asked to assess 6 pieces of work, one of them being their own work \" [emphasis added].

Sounds OK but I'm not particularily happy with these measures. I'm now thinking of using distances from the means as a easier-to-understand concept. They will work closer to the \"wood\", in the sense of using the raw values from the individual scales rather than the overal grade scores. I think that will make them more robust. What's needed is a measure to take out the \"jokers\" from the pack. I think using multi-dimensional distances could do just that. I'm running several workshops with some fairly large groups this term so I'm hoping to have plenty of real data to play with. Ray",

          "Text": "Hi, I seem to be having a problem with the workshop module. 1, I created a workshop in a fictional class with two students and one instructor. 2. I want the module to work out so that each student self-assesses their own paper and also assesses the work of one of their peers. So, the number of assessments of student submissions is set to 1 and self assessment is set to yes. 3. I can login as either of the two users and submit and self-assess the work. 4. I can login as the administrator/instructor and assess the work that students have submitted. But, heres the problem: Neither student is given the others paper to gradethats true if I have it in either the submit and assess phase or just the assess phase. According to the module, there are no papers for them to assess other than their own. As another quirk, but may be related, if I as course instructor go to administer I can view things just fine in the table under Student Assessments, but on the table under Student Submissions if I click on the List Assessments (2) link (2 is right.. one self-assessment from the student and one from me), I get nothing except a continue to click on, as if nothing is there. I can, however, click Edit and pull up my instructor assessment of the paper. So Any idea whats up? Up until now Moodle has behaving like a dream for me. Im running the latest development version (well, the one downloaded from yesterday). In general Ive had great luck with the development version, with the exception of the journal bug from a few days ago that was fixed (it wasnt showing any journal articles that were submitted by students, but now thats fixed in the latest download ). Any ideas?  I've got two courses this semester that I'd love to use this on, so it would be terrific to figure this out soon. John",

          "Text": "This version now attempts to handle student re-submissions in the peer assessment phase in a much better way than previously. In the workshop that allows re-submissions (which is a normally a \"good\" thing) a student can re-submit provided their piece of work has been (peer) assessed (at least once). The student(s) who did to the assessment(s) are asked to assess the new piece of work and they are shown the assessment form already filled out (using their assessment of the old peice of work). If a student has been asked to assess a piece of work which gets replaced by a new submission, AND they haven't yet done that assessment, that allocation is deleted. The new (re-)submission will get allocated for (peer) allocated in the normal run of events. This version is available on the Module pages and do require an Admin login (there's a small change to one of the Workshop tables). Ray",
