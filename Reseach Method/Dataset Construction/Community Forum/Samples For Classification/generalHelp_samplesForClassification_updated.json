          "Text": "I could be a moodle maniac ... I really like the software. But I've got a couple of problems that I can't seem to figure out. 1. I login as a teacher and bring up a list of assignments. The students are sending me word documents for most of the file uploads so for each assignment, so I bring up the list of work that has been submitted. Then I open the file to look at their work. When I close the document and return to the list. I find that I'm now logged in as the student. Has anyone had this problem before? I haven't found anything like this in the fourm. Could this be some kind of session problem? 2. Students sometimes upload word documents that I cannot view. I have checked their copies of the documents and I can see them on a local workstation without a problem. I have also downloaded a copy of the file to my workstation and I cannot see it there. A file is transferred and the size of the file appears to be correct but it is almost like the file is getting damaged in some way. I found one reference to a similar problem on the forum but when I tried it, it messed up php by setting a variable in the config file that would not let you see files outside your webspace . If anyone has and recommendations for either of these problems I would be most appreciative. Carter",

          "Text": "Out of the blue today, I tried signing into my Moodle site as admin, and the page loaded blank (the moodle logo was at the top, the \"logged in as admin\" link was visible in the top right, but all content on the page was missing). Down at the bottom left corner was the yellow error icon, which states: Message: 'xdr' is null or not an object Line: 7 Char: 1984 Code: 0 URI: http://<mymoodleserver>/moodle/lib/yui/connection/connection-min.js After mucking about on the internet for a while and not finding a concrete cause of/solution to the problem, I reverted to a snapshot I made of the server a few days ago and was able to get the main page to load when signing in, but with a caveat I will explain below. After reverting to the snapshot from a few days ago, I've tested logging in to the site with Firefox , IE8, and Google Chrome (I know it's not officially supported by Moodle, but it's my default browser). Out of the 3, IE8 is the only one that reports \"Done, but with errors on page\" error on the bottom, even though all the links and content appear to load. This information included in this error is the same javascript error as I listed above. Chrome and Firefox both seem to handle it fine and don't spit back any error whatsoever. The problem is that our users use both Firefox and IE , but predominantly IE, so I can't just tell them to switch browsers. A few questions: 1. What does this error mean? I'm a server admin, not a programmer. I've looked at line 7 char 1984 in that js file and nothing looks terribly wrong, but what do I know? 2. What would have caused this error to happen in the first place? 3. How do I resolve it, and keep it from happening again? Thanks in advance!",

          "Text": "I have a single student in a course who was unable to view their grades. While investigating this I realized that they are unable to see the administration block (which would usually contain the grades link), which I believe is the problem. All other students in the course are able to see the block (and thereby the grades link) and view their grades, so it appears that only this specific student is affected. I've compared her roles and permissions with those of other students in the course but they appear identical. As a temporary workaround I have given her the url of the page that the grades link in the administration block would usually direct her to (https://moodle. <our domain >.edu/grade/report/index.php?id=< id num shown at the end of the url when viewing the course>) and she appears to be able view her grades that way. I'm still stumped as to why she isn't able to see the Administration block though. Our Moodle version is: 2.6.11+ (Build 20150619)",

Then you can go to this document: PayPal Enrolment . While this is set up for Moodle 1.8, it is valid for v1.9+ as well. There are a number of discussions in the Forums for errors that can and do occur. You can search the Forums for them, too many to mention here, but a search will find them all. You may also want to go to PayPal and set up an account, if you haven't done so already. They have a lot of information there to help you.

My experience has been that the same hardware running on linux can often be tuned to cope with a larger capacity than windows server. If you really have to run windows the best performance configuration I've seen so far is: Latest version of Moodle PHP 5.5 with https://docs.moodle.org/en/OPcache Then the wincache plugin with opcode cache disabled for MUC (otherwise it conflicts with built in 5.5. opcache) https://moodle.org/plugins/view/tool_wincache when you install wincache it will have opcode enabled by default - you MUST disable this otherwise it conflicts with the built-in opcode. The next step would be to modify the wincache code to work for Moodle sessions (at the moment it doesn't support this) - doing that would help to improve performance even further.",

So, instead (in the meantime) ... Many might be wondering ... why?  Well, have seen several postings in these forums where the poster had only a 1.9 backup and was asking how they could recover 'stuff' from it.  In 1.9 backups it was fairly easy to get the files that were used in the course.  Just un-zip the backup and in the 'files' folder there were your documents. All that changed with version 2 backups.  Now the backups use the 'new file system' ... contenthash, etc..  Situation, however, might be the same ... have only a .mbz backup of a course and need to get the files that were contained in that course.  This now requires working with an xml file and 'sluthing' the humanly recognizable file name contained in 'files' folder by hash name.  Doing this without the benefit of a database . Before going any further, the scripts are bash and php and do require a little command line utility called 'xmllint' (present on CentOS and MacOSX - or can be acquired).  The scripts are also pretty stark ... nothing but what is needed.  But, they are simple to execute and the results are, I think, on target. Offered as is .... and in the 'spirit of sharing'.  One can see a screen capture of how to use (and acquire) via: http://sos.tcea.org/moodle24/ Right on the front page : Moodle 2 Backup File Extract Scripts (swf) 5.6MB application/x-shockwave-flash Hint: when opening the above link might want to re-size it larger.

We have around 15 departments with about 2000 courses at our university and we need for each department to have its own department page to have general information for students and staff. All our enrollments are automatically done via our MIS and I was thinking that the best way I could do this is to have a Meta course for each department and adding all the department courses to it as child courses. Therefore all the students enrolled on any of the deparments courses will have access to the department area. Is this the best way of doing this? and if so is there an easier way to add all relevent courses to a meta course rather than searching for them and adding them one by one. Some of our departments have 300+ courses so this method will take a rather long time Thanks for any advice Paul",

In particular where the profile pages show a field for \"IDnumber\", it promptly displays the value for \"Institution\". This happens for both \"course\" and \"full\" profile pages. The MySQL query: select username, idnumber, institution from mdl_user; yields precisely the information I would expect to see. Thus, it isn't that the data in My SQL is corrupted.

Anyway, we're having a problem with the Unenroll links, both in the individual courses, and in the Profile area of the user...basically, they are not there. I've tested across different user types (student/teacher/admin), and verified that the \"Unassign own roles\" setting on the Teacher, Student, Authenticated User, and Administrator Roles are all set to Allow, but still no go...the link just doesn't show up. I've searched through the forums for help with this, but all signs point to the \"Unassign own roles\" setting not being turned on, but even turning that on did not fix the problem. Anyone have any other ideas or places that I can check? Thanks in advance!",

I'm building out some Moodle courses (say, for example, physics 101) that will have multiple sections (e.g., a tues-thurs section and a mon-wed-fri section). I know \"sections\" may mean a different thing in Moodle Courses, but I'm talking about \"instances\" of a course. Hope that makes sense. I am trying to find a way to not have to build out the same course several times. I want each section to be a separate entity, however--they may have different teachers, and seperate forums. So, is there functionality in Moodle to do this, to create \"instances\" of a course? Thanks for any advice, or if my question is not clear, please let me know. Thanks, Sol",

Groups &, especially, groupings will allow you to run \"sections\" (in the non-Moodle sense) within one classroom. We do that for some of our courses. You can also use the backup & restore function to generate identical classrooms, which we do for courses that don't eat a lot of space (e.g., all text & no video, audio, etc.). Any time you start generating classrooms/courses, you should consider using categories. The admin and teacher views of Moodle's front page can become cluttered rather quickly, and categories such as \"Fall, 2009\" will help keep things tidy.",

INCLUDE RANGE ROW AT TOP AND FREEZE. Freezing the left column, i.e. column with student names, improved the usability of the gradebook grader view. Scrolling up and down is still problematic. Proposed Improvement : · Freeze the rows with the activity names and category designations to improve usability when scrolling up and down in grader view. · Put the Range row at the top under the activity names and freeze as well. It is logical to have the range for an activity visible along with the activity name. http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-21746 GRADEBOOK - PROVIDE TEACHERS WITH THE OPTION TO ROUND GRADES The MOODLE gradebook allows the teacher to specify the number of decimal points to display for each grade. According to MOODLE Docs , this setting has no effect on grade calculations, which are made with an accuracy of 5 decimal places. Some teachers choose to round. If they display grades with 0 decimal points, the number will display as if it was rounded. If grades are displayed as both real and letter, there are situations where the grade the student sees does not match what they are expecting to see. EXAMPLE: Suppose 90.0000 is set as the lower bound for an A- Suppose the 1st quarter average was calculated to be 89.5412",

          "Text": "Hi everybody. This is my\nfirst post on this forum so I apologize in advance for any mistake and\nspecially, my English. I belong to\na Public Institution who runs a Moodle platform with around 5000 users. We have\nbeen maintaining this server during several public managements, which unfortunately\nmeans under quite different authentication methods for students and professors.\nNowadays are coexisting three kinds: Email-based\nself-registration Manual\naccounts Upload users (only allow for Administrators) The main\nsituation is that it is getting out of control with so many usernames. Back\nthen we took the decision to force the username field only with numbers and\nsuggest/trust the users to fill it up with their document number. But then we\nstarted to incorporate foreign users which meant a new challenge. For example, time\nto time when any member of the staff wants to upload users through the back\ninterface to the database some of them are not possible to create, because they\nalready exist (duplicated). This issue is increasing time to time. I wonder if\nthere is any practical way to manage this situation. So far I can only think in\none option: external link self-registration and then auto generated the\nusername and send the whole accesses through e-mail. The problem with this\noption is that we don’t have a specialized programmer and I guess are necessary\nsome skills. What about an external server? However, if this is the only way we’ll\nhave to do it. In conclusion, we want to keep the authentication methods mentioned above and settle a kind of pattern for new usernames. We can handle the \" Upload users\" part, but we can not control what happens every time a new users wants to self-register in our Moodle. Any link,\nsuggestion, documentation is more than welcome. I've searched on the Internet about this situation but I couldn't find anything so far. Thanks in\nadvance. Greetings, 4lifetime",

We had the same problem for a while, and it exists everytime you have you have roll your on and upload by CSV in the same system. A really simple code fix You could add an odd letter combination whenever you uploaded usernames.  Like maybe all with usr as the first three letters.  All you need then is a tiny code fix to not ever allow anyone to self create with usr.  Then you know that all the usr names are yours. I am not advocating this.  Having core hacks is not the best. -Derek",

We made sure that a CRON script is running, and it was (every 5 minutes). When I looked in the completion settings I saw that the Activity completion is locked and a button appeared stating \"Clear completion data..\" or something like that. After clearing (I know, I know, but no users were harmed during this testing) the other Moodle serve began receiving completion data of four users (all at once) who had completed the activities , but received no success data. Is it possible that no data is transferred during completion data lock? Your comments will be appreciated. Thanks.",

So there is no \"userA registered on May 1st, so open topic 2 for userA on May 16th (i.e. 15 days later); userB registered on May 3rd, so open topic2 for userB on May 18th (i.e. 15 days later)\" functionality. About the only thing you can control is the overall \"release date\", so you could set each individual activity/resource in a new topic to be released on \"May 24th at 11:55pm\" for everyone in the course. If you set it up this way, all students will be able to see the links to the activities /resources, but when they click on them, they will be presented with a screen that says, \"This activity/resource is not available yet,\" until May 24th at 11:55pm. Not sure if this functionality is coming in 2.0, but I doubt it. On the other hand, you might find that Conditional Activities (core in 2.0; hack in 1.9) provide the functionality you want. Topics would become available based on completion of previous Topics.",

Some of these themes have placed on the right blocks that are normally on the left, e.g. navigation, settings etc. I am thinking particularly of themes such as simplespace and creatif. I cannot seem to find a way of shifting these blocks back to the left in a simple way. Are the positions of these blocks hard-wired in the  themes or are am I missing something?

          "Text": "Hi Andrew, In Moodle 2.0 there are no longer the two hard-coded block regions, now themes are able to choose what block regions they want to make available. In the case of themes where there all the block are on the right that is because they have chosen to only use one block region, which of course means you won't be able to move the blocks to any other place. Unfortunately there is no quick fix to introduce additional block regions, if you want to you will have to either copy or extend the theme you want to use and then edit the layout files and CSS to introduce the new block regions. If this is a path you want to go down I strongly suggest reading http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Themes_2.0 and the other doc pages that are listed under `See also`. The themes forum is also very active if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask there. Hope that helps in some way. Cheers Sam",

It is slow, imprecise...  However, I accidentally clicked on the move icon and a screen popped up asking to which week I wanted to move it. Quick and direct! However, here is a perplexity: When I am dragging a week of resources, if I move the cursor to the left or right of the drag icon, the whole schedule drifts to the left or right.  How strange is that?  Is there any benefit for this phemon? Work Saver: I added a week to the course and used the extra week as a shopping cart.  As I drag it up/down the list of weeks, I can collect resources to move by dragging them in or out as needed. The point is that anything in the shopping cart are moved all at once when it is dragged. The only real catch here is that you have to move it to the bottom of the list when you are done or put the number of weeks back to what they should be as it throws off dates.  Still, it is useful.  Maybe by Moodle 5.8 this will be a tool instead. Life is good.....",

It will not negatively impact on the Moodle. Tell everyone to empty their cache too - dump their Moodle cookies as well, if they know how to, if they do not then it should not be too much of a problem, but with PHP overkill in cleanups is often better than insufficient.",

Instead of displaying the courses, the system display \"There are 220 subjects\", and display the search course field. We use display \"List of Subject\" for the frontpage setting. I suspect this is because too many courses to be displayed. For student, they still can view the list of courses, because they are only enroll to few courses. But, administrator cannot see because, Administrator has access to all courses. We are using moodle. 2.3, running on Red Hat LInux, and MySQL .

Basically what I need is a way to create customized course packages. I've already determined that using the meta course link option won't work for what I have in mind because I have courses that I need to be within packages but also stand alone. My courses are not one time things, and they don't end, so they are open forever, for students to revisit and enjoy whenever they like....refresh their memories or go back and do activities they missed their first time around, that sort of thing. They are a lot of fun. For kids. So what I am doing is offering packages with groups of courses, but I'm also offering some of the courses separately. So the problem is that I cannot just meta course link them together because if I do that then if a person buys a stand alone class that is from that package separately, then they end up getting the linked courses too. So I'm just wondering if there's a way to make packages of classes in another way? Link classes in a way that offers multiple groupings? As far as I can tell, the meta course link only offers one grouping , correct? If this is true...and there's no plugin or other way to package classes in another way, then I suppose I'll just have to give families a bunch of enrollment keys so they can get the stand alone courses when they buy the appropriate packages that includes them. But I had hoped to make it easier for them then that. I just need to be able to have these specific courses be able to be offered as individual courses AND also included in packages....because some people will want the package, and some will just want certain courses individually. Is there any way to do that short of just giving them a whole list of enrollment keys and making them have to manually enroll themselves?",

Single GCE instance, however, isn't as scalable as someone described in these forums as it is on Amazon. Of course, one can always find a blog : http://yiannakasgeorge.com/2015/06/22/how-to-autoscale-moodle-lms-on-amazon-web-services/ Much to cuss/discuss ... and due to 'cloud wars', it is a moving target right now. But, don't let that discourage you from pursuing ... do pursue ... and please come back to share your experiences. IMHO , one of these days Moodle Forums might include forums especially for Amazon Hosted, Google Hosted, Azure Hosted, etc. Wonder how many Moodle Partners actually host with Amazon (other) right now? ;) 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

Often, it is only the Dashboard that is used in larger Moodle, which essentially does away with using Category pages as part of the navigation through the Moodle. The Dashoboard only shows those courses the User is enrolled in.",

One particular university is currently using Ver. 1.9.2 but has plans to upgrade later this summer. My developers have asked me what version of Moodle they need to produce this cartridge for, and because they're not sure what version they will be upgrading to, I don't really have an answer for them yet. Are there any isses with backwards compatible support for cartridges in the newest version of Moodle? I've heard that 2.0 will be realeased shortly. Will there be issues with backwards compatibility with 2.0? Thanks",

Moodle has supported the SCORM standard for learning objects (horrible phrase) for some time, and fairly recently, I think about Moodle 1.9.3, a lot of bugs were fixed, and we now pass the SCORM 1.2 test suite, although we are not certified (yet). If SCORM is not enough then there are a couple of optoins If you are interested in formatting your content so that it can be imported into Moodle as native Moodle content, then you should write files to the Moodle backup format. That is not documented in detail anywhere, but it is basically a zip file containing moodle. xml and files. We strive to keep that backwards compatible, (so if you make a backup from Moodle 1.6, it should restore into Moodle 1.9, for example).",

I have set up a scale of 4 levels and an assignment with assigned rubric with a score of total 17 points. As far as I can see, the breakdown from rubric points to scale seems to be Level 1 (fail): 0 - 2 points Level 2 (review) : 3 - 8 points Level 3 (pass) : 9 - 14 points Level 4 (outstanding): 15 - 17 points The lower levels I think seem to be a strange breakdown and are set too low. Our ideal would be Level 1 (fail): 0 - 8 points Level 2 (review): 9 - 10 points Level 3 (pass): 11 - 14 points Level 4 (outstanding): 15 - 17 points However, I can't see where to set these levels (if at all) or how I can match my rubric points to fit into that criteria (or even come close). Could someone please offer some advice/help on what I should be looking to set and where, or where in the code that the calculations are done? Thanks in advance",

Possibly they are a non-edititing teacher in the course, instead of an editing teacher. To allow them to add content to a category (including new courses) you need to be logged in as an administrator, click on the course category, then add them as a teacher. If you in the course iteself when you assign their role, it only affects tha one course, and everywhere else they remain the default role, which is \"authenticated user\". Assigning them at the category level can bite you later if you need to transfer a course from one category to another (an english 101 class goes from category \"English\" to category \"Beginning English\" for example.) The teacher role has permissions in the \"English category\" but not in the \"Beginning English\" category. (You only tranferred the class itself.) Hope this helps, as this is one of the hardest concepts to understand and keep track of in Moodle.",

I guess GCSE and Diploma exam boards will be producing tracking and assessment vocabularies as well. Any LP that includes course management in school will probably need to be able to automatically update it's tracking and assemnet tables with these vocabularies. As far as I am aware Becta intend to organise a web service and download services for LP to do this automatically. Is there anywhere in Moodle where you can track coverage of a programme of study against authoritative vocabularies? All I can think of is the scales section?

Now, to the issue.  G-Daddy is one of the most secure virtual providers in the industry.  It is really hard to adjust anything with them. Most of what I will tell you is relative to what type of hosting you have with them.  If you have access to cPanel then you can go to your root directory and you will see php.ini there.  If on the other hand you are on shared hosting, you will need to put a php.ini file in your /<Moodle>/ directory.  So if you can give us a little more info it will make it much easier to help you.",

I only know how to change the max upload as I hit the help with this page feature on my moodle site. I can see tons of php files in the FTP site that I use to upload my courses. As I'm sure you know once I create a course and then go to upload my SCORM content I create a folder which I then use the FTP site to upload my zip file into the proper numbered folder. Even though my max upload says 32mb I've already loaded and am currently running 4 course above that threshold (50 - 65mb). The course I'm enter now are around 178mb.

          "Text": "Stefan, thanks for this information. First, I see that you probably purchased the GoDaddy Economy VPS.  The 1GB of RAM might cause problems.  I have a Value VPS, and when I check, I have only 800MB of the 2000MB free, so my \"simple\" install is needing 1.2GB.  Having said this, maybe you will be okay.  I have just always purchased the \"Value\" VPS, which has 2GB of RAM. Here is what I have running on my VPS: PHP Version 5.5.7, MySQL 5.5.34, CENTOS 6.4, Apache 2.2.26.  The VPS comes with a basic configuration, but you can bump up the versions of PHP and MySQL yourself.  Not know what else you might be doing with your VPS, you have to be careful of versions of all of these things.  I am just running my website and Moodle, so my configuration is running fine. If you want to explore a little, from WHM, go into \"EasyApache\".  This is where you can modify your system \"easily\".  You should see that you can change the version of PHP, mySQL, and many other things.  Eventually, you will need to add a few features for Moodle using EasyApache, so exploring will be beneficial. Remember, if you mess up your VPS, you can simply \"reprovision\", and this puts you right back to ground zero. I find this to be a really great feature, and I do mess things up (on my experimental VPS). As you have probably learned, one disadvantage of a GoDaddy VPS is that you are expected to do many things on your own.  I have learned much on my own over the last 4 years, and some other guidance that you are getting is based upon what others have learned.  Often, there are more than one way to do things, so you will probably have to digest everyone's input yourself. I want to tell you, however, that this GoDaddy VPS really does work!  I teach around 15 courses a year, about 300 students a year, all on my own install of Moodle.  I can easily upgrade, and the GoDaddy system is very solid.  Some folks don't prefer (like) GoDaddy, but I am one who believes that with size (GoDaddy might now be the largest server company), comes some knowledge (they seem to know how to set up these VPSs), which delivers some comfort to me. It might be fine for you to experiment with the basic Economy VPS, you might not be able to run \"Opcache\", but Moodle will still work for you. Keep asking for help, and people will try to help.  I was swamped with my online courses over the last week, and traveling, but for the next 5 days I will be watching for your posts.  Let us know if you decide to upgrade to the Value VPS.",

Quite honestly, if you do the move yourself you would learn a lot more, and you would know what you had done so that you can repeat it, if necessary.  But I understand your situation. On my production VPS, I am still running a copy of Moodle 1.9 (upgraded, of course).  When I went to Moodle 2.0, I started from scratch.  But I preserved all of my Moodle 1.9 files so that I could get back to historical course data.  What I find interesting is that Moodle 1.9 runs just fine on my upgraded VPS. If you happen to buy a new Value VPS, you can install the new Moodle on it.  I would suggest the latest Moodle, 2.6.2+.  Then, eventually, you can move your old Moodle to this VPS.  I think you said you were willing to start from scratch with Moodle 2, but my memory can be wrong. Incidentally, on your VPS, you can have many installs of Moodle.  For example, www.yourdomain.com/moodle , www.yourdomain.com/moodle19 , www.yourdomain.com/moodle-experiment , and so forth.  Then, when you want to experiment and not disturb your \"production\" moodle, you can.",

Are you using a Moodle you have built for yourself or the Moodle created online for free? In either case, PDF files are a mainstream file type so should be able to be uploaded with no fuss. If you are talking about MoodleCloud, then as long as the file is less that 200MB in size it should upload without an issue. I don't think that the MoodleCloud restricts PDF's in any way. For your own Moodle, the filesize is restricted by several factors, the upload limit of the server , the upload limit of the PHP server, the site upload limit of the Moodle and the course upload limit of each course (if it is lower than the site upload limit).  That, however, should not throw a non-recognized file type error.",

I have been trying to find a way to do this for a couple of weeks on and off now and it's driving me up the wall as it must be possible! The end point is I would like a 'group' of users (e.g. staff) to have moodle/course:view permission to all courses in a given category. I can do this individually by assigning them a role at the category level that has the moodle/course:view permission (eg. giving them the role of Pupil after adding pupils to be able to view without enrolment. But cannot find a way of either automatically giving them the role as an individual based on an AD group or any other way of achieving this. I have managed to do it for the 'Authenticated User' role, but I want to be more specific. The actual scenario is that we would like to create a category 'Staff Room' and have multiple courses in the category relating to Risk Assessments, School Policies, Trip Forms etc. each of which will have their own course owners and 'teachers'. I could enrol them all into each course but it will make their course lists very long. Any help greatly received. Thanks,",

Also a dummy name for the question has to be set (since it cannot be blank). Then you have to select the correct answer choice using a drop down box. Meanwhile you have to scroll a fair amount while doing all of this. So what I want is two options: \"Tell me the number of questions you would like and number of answer choices per questions\"",

For example I still have to denote answer choices, which in my case I don't. I just want it to be a, b, c, & d. I guess I can copy paste this part, change the question name to the number, and change the correct answer to the right multiple choice letter? Any other ideas?",

          "Text": "Thanks for that link Ashley, from what I see j-close is for fill in the gap exercises which is not what I'm looking for. Here is a paraphrasing of what I want again: Students will read questions and answer choices from the hard copy textbook exercises . Suppose the answer to #1 is c, then they would simply fill in c for #1 on a Moodle (or HotPotatoes, or some online) quiz. The Moodle quiz has no question material or actual answer choice material, just a way to fill in the multiple choice answer. Then when submitted it will check the answers against my key. If #1 was actually d, it would be marked wrong. Then the student will refer to the textbook and check answer choice d to see what the correct answer is. Really similar to how a scantron works. My reasoning is that I have great paper based resources, and do not want to convert a whole textbook worth of questions/answer choices to Moodle, because of the time factor as well as possible copyright issues. Hope that clears it up! Thanks again for everyone's input.",

If you have programming skills you should not find it to hard otherwise trial and error. Who said Life Long Learning was just for the students?

However, doing so in 2.0 yields the error \"Could not find answer\" (no error code yet, although there is a tracker entry for it, with key MDL-22240 ; there's also a similar error resulting from a blank field in a different part of the Lesson activity recorded in the Tracker as MDL-22688 , which has already been discussed a bit here in the forums), and from that point on, editing the Lesson is impossible: the same error just pops up every time the Edit tab is clicked on.

There is no confirmation email send and if I try to register again it tells me that username and email address already exists. If I login as administrator I can see that a new user has been registered and needs confirmation, so I confirm the new user. Then when the new user types the username and password and clicks “login” button, it takes the user to “new user registration” page but it logs you in at the same time, so you can navigate away! But if you logout and login the second time, it logs you in fine. Thank you.",

IF they fail, I know where to find them - moodledata/temp/backup/ If they succeed, having a designated directory means I can see them by humanly recognizable names ... with date/time stamps in the filenames themselves (they might have reference in the DB but are NOT lost in the sea of moodledata/filedir/) If Logged on and manually doing the backups via Course Admin menu, those go to moodledata/filedir/ and they will display in the GUI - tagged as private area but they are still the 'sea'. I actually setup a file system repo .... /moodledata/repository/backups/ and then point the autobackups to that location. I can still get to those backups for restore by setting up the file system repo in a course, then pointing that to /moodledata/repository/backups/   Don't have to have that setup in every course ... just one course. Now if autobackups is still messed up ... possibly related to the DB tables that reference backups.  Found that when I played with it too much setting different options I manged to confuse the system (and myself) and somehow got the dates for a scheduled backup already past the present or upcoming date ... in other words, that one course would *never* be backed up ... not for a year! So, the only way to gain control over autobackups again was to truncate the tables storing auto backup information. ﻿ mdl_backup_controllers mdl_backup_courses mdl_backup_logs That 0'd out any tracking Moodle was doing with all backups.  No harm done cause it's not working anyway! Then ran the autobackups as manual just one time ... moodlecode/admin/cli/autobackup.php That will take whatever defaults there are for course backups and create ONE backup for all courses ... to Moodle none have been backed up and place them in a directory where I can find them ... see them ... and IF desired, even tinker with them. Once I saw that succesful, then set the schedule to be non-prime time at such a time where I thought they would all complete ... like 12:30 PM on every other day. They have been working since and have not had to fiddle with any of it.    Fingers Crossed. Now if there are 10 courses added and a couple of those are huge, then things might start to degrade and I might have to revisit the planning, scheduling etc. 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

A working party did look at it earlier this year at MootAu15, and if I heard correctly, there has been a proposal to make it part of core in the future. How long this will take I don't know. While this is a good idea for a small Moodle, or perhaps for Categories or even courses, a site wide zipped file could be  of massive size. Even with using the .tar.gz format just creating the zip would likely break the Moodle, use up all the resources on a server which may not be welcomed on a shared server. I have seen some courses, particularly those using videos, higher end graphics and even sound files, going well over 4gb, so this sort of functionality needs to be very carefully considered as to how it is to be implemented in a site.",

The structure of moodle is perhaps (?!) *fairly* inflexible, (moodlers, please show me I am wrong!) but most often *entirely adequate* for teachers. 'Inflexible' often means good because it is simple and easy to understand. ( Ilias for example has, perhap,s a more flexible resource heirarchy but it looks reallly difficult to use to me.) Generally, in Moodle at the top of the content tree/heirarchy one has the site (course number 1) and on that site/course page there is the list of courses OR categories of courses, and the courses generally have serval \"topics\" or \"weeks\" with \" activities /resources\" (\"modules\") inside them. These activities/resources are in a sequence, without structural depth. The categories of course can be nested indefinately. Facitilities for the structure of content at lower levels (such as modules within modules) are fairly limited, perhaps. The Lesson and Scorm modules have the functionality to provide depth of a sort. There is some new code somewhere for heirarchical topics/weeks.  I looked for the past 15 minutes but I can't find the forum. Please will someone remind us where it is? You may also be interested in this thread where we are discussing other possible heirarchies. Timothy",

I am creating the same groups and put the same students in the same groups for each of the courses.. I must do this for all the grades from 1 to 12!!! This is a really crazy job!

I read the topics posted on Moodle and elsewhere regading this and the availablility of an EXE file run from Windows that will automatically take care of this once set up. I have downloaded, set up and run this EXE file and while it does its job after set up, I discovered that the next day I get a notification on Moodle indicating that the Cron has not been run for 24 hours. My Moodle site runs off a Linux server managed by a service provider. I do not have access to running the Cron from its Cpanel and hence have to run it from my PC using this EXE file with the hope it will perform the Cron job effectively. But it fails. Can anyone help point out my mistake? OR how I can get it to run off the Linux server without access to its command line or its Cpanel to set up the Cron from there? Many thanks.",

          "Text": "Hi Mike, It may start being the same bits of code pasted into the two sections , however the output is that the code in the main section of a wiki page is getting mangled as it is being interpretted as wiki text. Since the allowScriptAccess param is being changes from always to never, then I suspect that it is based on the different options which are being used to call lib/htmlpurifier on the text being processed. The key to the problem seems to be trying to embed a flash object which has a separate loader \"bootstap.swf\", and a data file listed in the flashvars parameter - content= http://content.screencast.com/users/DoorCountySolar/folders/900%20-%20Marketing%20Plan/media/e91f54cd-f049-4694-a773-479e5ad68253/gfgdfgdfgdfgfdg.swf . The flashvars param seems to be working the the summary area, but disappearing when the code is included in the main body of the wiki. There might be a way to sidestep all of this complexity.  If you have swf option turned on in the moodle media filters, have you tried just including a simple link to the content of the screencast: <a href=\"http://content.screencast.com/users/DoorCountySolar/folders/900%20-%20Marketing%20Plan/media/e91f54cd-f049-4694-a773-479e5ad68253/gfgdfgdfgdfgfdg.swf\">Screencast 1</a> With any luck, the moodle filter should write out a flash object to embed the swf file.  You can also specify the height and width by adding  ...fdg.swf?d=640x320\" With screencast.com, be careful to use the file specified by the content= variable hidden in the flashvars instead of the bootstrap.swf file. You may lose some of the advantages of using a the bootstap loader and having a nice poster image while loading, but it might work for the situation you describe. -- Sean Farrell Edinburgh, Scotland",

While I was waiting for help I continues to play around with it and ended up with an even better alternative. I opened a sample SWF (presentation video) Did a sceen-capture of the video and saved to .png Pulled the image into Fireworks, sized it to fit and placed a \"Click Anywhere to View Video\" over the top. Grouped the two into a single .png FTP 'd the image to my regular website Navigated to the web page, right clicked and used \"copy image location\" Tabbed over to my Moodle site and inside the Description box Clicked on the Insert Image and then pasted the URL of the image Tabbed back over to the Web page again and opened the SWF which places the URL of the Flash into the URL line. Copied that path. Went back to my Moodle site, clicked on the image and then on the Moodle Media icon (2.0). Pasted the URL of the SWF and added a title. There are a number of things I like about this in lieu of my previous embed of Object Code: The page loads much faster because it is only loading an image rather than part of an embedded video When clicking on the image the video opens full screen based on the settings of the Flash video (set to allow resizing) If I want to use the same image and video somewhere else I can just copy and paste it. That picks up the image URL and the SWF URL If I change the image (via my website) or the SWF on my website then all of those changes are updated on all uses in Moodle. In the Wiki it works the same up top in the Description block as it does in the lower (wiki) section. No issues like I had with the embed code. Much easier to explain how to do this to others authorized to edit the wiki. They do not need to go into the HTML to perform this task. P.S. I did find it was even cleaner if I 1st created a single row/column table, placed a background color in it and a 9px border then placed the image and linked video inside that single cell. The table obeyed my request to center itself in the block whereas the image without the table wanted to hang to the left. I would say that is \"still having the cake and eating it\". Thanks for all your help. Let me know if you see any flaws in this method. Mike Here is sample. Enter as Guest http://workshops.therenewablenetwork.com/mod/wiki/view.php?id=3",

I have been reviewing our database growth and already have a process in place to replicate the activity log to a separate DB so that we can let the cron job prune our Moodle DB.  I would like to be able to do similar things for our largest tables (in # of records) as the top 6 have hundreds of thousands to millions of rows each: question_attempt_steps question_attempt_step_data certificate_linked_modules question_attempts log question_answers grade_grades_history question question_multichoice question_usages quiz_attempts grade_grades quiz_grades But I want to make sure I better understand what will be left in the active system for grade history, and to make sure I capture all of the tables that we might need to reference later in the separate, logs DB. Another table on the list is certificate_linked_modules.  It really seem like it is just 1.5 million unnecessary records.  Anyone have any idea purging it / preventing future growth? And I need to dig some more about our quiz setups to see if we might just be able to log less of the audit stuff there.  And though we have a lot of students, we do not offer all that many different courses so it seems strange that our question table makes the list.  We tend to clone existing courses for new iterations so I would only have expected references to that table to be growing, rather than the number of question entries themselves.  So if anyone else has been digging in these areas it would be great to collaborate. I have added some (ms sql ) scripts if anyone wants a head start doing the same type of separate log DB.  Just create the db and then play in the scripts in order to create the tables and Stored Procedure.  You can then schedule the SP to run daily prior to the cron job.  It will keep backing up the new activity log entries, and then also gives you an entry in the history table to help check back that the process is working properly. If I end up having to dig into code and test to find the answers about some of those tables then I will post back to this thread.  And hopefully by then I will have dug up my epoch to sql datetime function so I can put together a purge job for the second db as well.  That way we can purge Moodle at perhaps something aggressive like 90 days, but keep the secondary records for a few years.

They have 150 classes and need to separate students by group, with each group having one teacher. Is there a way to globally assign a teacher to a group? Students currently log in and are assigned to a group using an enrollment key, but have to do that for each course. If there was a way for them to automatically be enrolled in all courses in a certain category (and in their assigned group) that would be helpful, too. So, to summarize my ideal scenario: Create one group with an enrollement key tied to it, assign a teacher to that group, and let students enroll in that group using an enrollment key. That group would be propogated to all courses in a category specified. I'm probably just missing something here, so if someone could just point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it. Glen",

I've to design a course with 2 parts: Part I: diverse materials taking 1 day with videos, docs and self-progressing lesson . Students can progress themselves without any teacher interaction. Part II: a synchronous exchange session with a teacher plus a final quizz evaluation. Students will be able to enroll at Part I when they want all year along. But as the Part II is sychronous, there is a need of a day/hour plannified (eg each thu at 4:00pm during one hour). Last constraint: the students will be able to follow only one synchronous session. Could anyone suggest me a cours structure (weekly? topics? ....) ? Thanks a lot Michel",

I know, lots of work, but you can make it a bit easier for yourself, write it once, in a label at the end of the course, then copy the raw text, in code format, paste that into a label in a course. If it requires an image, then you can use the image once and the absolute reference made by the code to the image should make it work properly.

          "Text": "Students cannot see their own grades on our Moodle 3.4 install. After much searching the forums I note that: - The student role has been granted permission to view their own grades. A look in the roles capability tables shows the student roll has a \"1\" for permissions. - The course itself is set to allow students to see their marks and - In the quiz setup grades are not set to hidden generally, nor are they set to be hidden until a certain date. When a student clicks on \"grades\" in the course navigation block they get this message, \"Sorry, but you do not currently have permissions to do that (View grades of other users)\" The url that opens upon clicking in the course navigation block is \"grade/report/grader/index.php?id=10\" (10 being the course id#) Just in case it matters, the template I am using is \"clean\" That's what I've got after boiling down the last 3 hours, lol.

In the process of creating a new user role \"Guest_User\", which I want to have more permissions than Guest but less than Student, I seem to have managed to lose the Authenticated User role. It does not show up on my Defined Roles list, nor does it appear in the User Policies, \"Default Role for All Users\" drop-down. I want Guest_User to have access to certain course material and quizzes, but not to be able to see or do anything else including changing the username, password, and email address. Here's what happened as best as I can reconstruct. I was trying to define the new Guest_User role and managed to shut off my admin privileges in the process, so that I could no longer login as admin. I ran adminfix.php, which restored my admin access, but now I don't see the Authenticated User role any more. Any ideas on how to restore Authenticated User? I'll be happy to provide additional information if needed. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help. Sorry to be such a newb.",

I've check the flv's more than once on an offline flv player at the work fine the whole way through, so it seems like its an issue in moodle, either in the loading process, or something else. Could someone PLEASE help me with this!!!??? Many thanks!!!",

This allows students to take 2 weeks' vacation. This arrangement prohibits deadlines, since it is possible for students to be working on different lessons and we allow students to go back to make up work. Each lesson ends with an essay assignment. Each lesson also has a workshop (forum discussion) in which several essays are posted and students comment. Students who come to a lesson late have the advantage of looking at the workshop to get ideas about what & how to write for their essay. We would like to prohibit entry into the workshop forum until after the essay assignment has been uploaded. (It occurs to me that we would also have to change settings in advanced uploading of assignments to prohibit deleting of files in the event a student decided to rewrite her essay after viewing essays in the workshop.)",

          "Text": "We are upgrading from Moodle 2.9 to Moodle 3.15 and have custom pages outside of Moodle, that we have built that replicates the navigation structure used in Moodle 2.9. This navigation works in 2.9. However, when moving to 3.15 this navigation menu is broken as it won't expand or collapse. This is the code that we used to get it to work in 2.9. \n```text\nYUI().use('node', function(Y) {\n     M.util.load_flowplayer();\n     setTimeout(\"fix_column_widths()\", 20);\n     M.yui.galleryversion=\"2010.04.08-12-35\";\n     Y.use(\"core_dock\",\"moodle-block_navigation-navigation\",function() {\n\n    M.block_navigation.init_add_tree({\"id\":\"5\",\"instance\":\"5\",\"candock\":false\n    });\n\n});\n```\n I noticed that YUI is going away for 3.15. So how do I call the tree navigation so it would work? I have searched help and tried the suggestions in the documentation, but didn't work. I have tried putting this into my php, but didn't work. $PAGE->requires->js_call_amd('core/tree', 'Tree', 'ins5'); Any help would be appreciated.",

This is not a problem, we can manage this through the user profile fields mechanism. However, what we need is to insert this information for each course. So for each course which the user participates in we need a field to input some information about the specific user. Is this something which is possible in Moodle?

Upload your zipped folder NOT your original (it will end in .zip ) as if you were uploading only one Then when it is done click on unzip. You will get a list of the files and just click OK at the bottom. Go to the middle section of your course. You can either then do Add a resource>link to a file or website and display them one at a time (boring and hard on the eye) or else you can select : add a resource>display a directory which will give you the option to choose the whole folder as a kind of yellow suitcase - and students click inside the link to see all the docs.",

Usually this means someone has moved something or the config.php file is using a static path statement like: $CFG-> wwwroot = ' http://mysite.org/moodle' ; when it might be better using something like: $CFG->wwwroot   = 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] .

My main file server, a Sun running Solaris, is fine for file serving, but was too slow with Moodle. I have made my server accessible from the Internet, but it has different domain names on the Internet side and the home side. This seems to cause problems when I upload files. I uploaded image files from the Internet side and included them in a glossary, and images display fine from that side, but not from my home side where I just get the file name in the glossary entry. If I right-click and get image properties it has the domain name from the Internet side included, and that will not work when I access if from home. However, if I follow Adminstration->Files and hover over the file names they include my home-side domain name. Is there any setting that would make file names self-relative?

The next question is how to setup the new user registration email to send out it doesn't send the users? The final question is with these videos it here a plugin or something to keep progress of the video for later viewing and start back at the previous spot and track progress and mark complete once it is fully watched?

Each course consists of approximately nine lessons, or in Moodle terms , topics. Is it possible to allow students to access certain topics within a course so that as they submit the assignment for topic one, they are allowed full access to topic two and as they complete assignment two, are granted access to topic three, and so on? Im thinking that if an assignment submission can be an event then it could trigger access permission for the next topic. Ive found discussions around this area here and here , but Im stuck as to the best option to take. I fear Im getting it all wrong: I see the entry level to the college as the first page in the moodle site for the college, with a full list of courses (approximately 40) where students log into whichever one theyve enrolled for by email. Then, the topics comprise our lessons of those courses. It would be perfect if each course had that same level of control and an enrolment key could be issued for each lesson after submission of an assignment, rather than for each course. But I assume this would mean re-installation of moodle per course, i.e. 40 times. What I need is a higher level of moodle. Am I totally off the mark? Thanks, Sinéad",

The language gets in the way, because a lot of words like Course and Lesson have special moodle meanings which may or may not coincide with what you mean. I think the answer to the last bit of your message is no - if one of your 40 university courses was, say, Archaeology, and you wanted 9 sequential bits of learning to happen, I would set up 9 moodle courses, Archaeology 1 to Archaeology 9.  This leaves you with the problem of mechanizing entry to the 8 higher levels - a lot depends on how many students you have and how you define a pass mark.

If I am right, then you may be able to open the SCORM package in something like RELOAD , then reset the display sizes in the imsmanifest. xml file I think it was.

Basically, you unzip the plugin and put its folder in the folder with the appropriate name. Themes go into \"Themes\" and such. Obviously, turn off your Moodle first. Copy folder into appropriate folder. Turn on Moodle. Login as admin. You will be taken to \"Notifications\" in Site Admin where you confirm the install. It really is quite simple, and with a local install, if you *truly* mess up, just delete all and start again. Practical example. I use Joseph's RegEx question type. As of Moodle 2+, it requires two other pieces. Each time I forget to install the two other pieces, Moodle notifications tells me I'm a fool and it won't run. I go get the two pieces and put them where they belong, and Moodle says thank you and runs.",

          "Text": "Hallo, When I go into a Moodle v2.8.1 Lesson block to change a text by editing a page, the TinyMCE HTML editor opens of course. However, when I copy new text (from Microsoft Notepad) and paste it in the text field, then this sentence now is blue after submitting it. So every time I make an update, I need to open the 'under water screen' to delete multiple spans on HTML-level. The code has been unnecessarily stamped, looks like this <span style = \"color: # 0088cc;\" color = \"# 0088cc\"> ... my text ... </ span>. What am I doing wrong, or do I use this editor incorrectly? How can I avoid removing that 'blue code' every time again and again, after a copy/paste action? Regards, Rges",

My first reaction would be, use something else, like NotePad++ or Crimson Editor or any one of any number of free UTF-8 editors. It is possible that the native Notepad charset is the Dark Side standard, mmm UTF-16 I suspect they use now, not the generic UTF-8 which some bright spark programmer has programmed to produce this effect on copied text to differentiate it. Alternatively, copied text has a bytemark with it so that may be the issue, Moodle recognises it as a foreigner so the text editor differentiates it. In either case, I suggest a move away from NotePad.",

Problem is the shared ip site logs you out after less than 1 hr, I have both sites the same, both have the same PHP Info, this is as far as I can see the only difference. Could it be the problem, should I change to a dedicated IP? Advice is really really needed as I need to use the shared IP site as its so much faster with more redundancy, so is anyone out there had this problem or has knowledge of this being a problem please reply.

If you are going to break students into specific classes, then you can just have an ordinary course, where all students are enrolled, and use groups within that course. You do not need a meta course for this. However, having had over 150 students in one course, and 6 groups, with three teachers, believe me, meta courses appear a far more attractive method.

As I say, I can find a way around this problem if I don't link to the given web page as a resource, but then I lose one of the nice things that resources offer which is to be able to see the web page within a frame and keep the site navigation visible.

After all discussions and pointers I've just a few last things I wouldn't mind some advice on... Firstly, I have a parent course with a cost applied to it. Once you've paid and enrolled your able to take a series of quizzes. Ideally I'd like to have the quizzes as part of the parent course and award a certificate for completing each quiz (not for completing the parent course). I don't think this is achievable though as to get a certificate you need to complete a course, right? So that would mean setting up meta courses as children of the parent course (Scenario 2 http://docs.moodle.org/en/Metacourses ) to house each quiz correct? The thing is I really need for the child courses to appear as a list once you've clicked through on the parent course link. I'm not sure if I've gone about setting up the courses the right way but at the moment my child courses are appearing under the available courses section on the home page: http://ultracec.riverlab.com/ Is there a way for the child courses to be hidden until you've followed the parent course link? Thanks for any help... Mark",

          "Text": "Hi all, Before I get to my questions, let me explain how my instance of moodle is set up. It's for a corporation. There are about 100 short courses, each covering a different topic - how to create a case, how to activate a client, how to read a contract, how to set up your vacation responder, and so on. Each manager has gone through these short courses and chosen the ones they want their employees to take. Analysts might need to take these 20, while account managers take those 18, and support staff take another 35. It's like a buffet, everything's available and people choose what they want. So, first question: is this a crazy way of setting this up? It was the only way I could come up with to not have multiple instances of the same content, but it doesn't seem like the intent of moodle. If anyone has a better way to set up this \"buffet line\", I'd love to hear it. Second question: what's the best way for students to see all the courses they're in, and their progress in each? I'm using the course meta link for enrollment and (maybe I just don't have it set up right) but I don't see an orderly way to display how many courses they've passed and how many they have left before they complete the meta course. Any recommendations on that front would be awesome.",

For account managers, they only need to know how to upload , edit, and download inventory. Campaign managers need to know that and basic trouble shooting. Support needs to know all of the above and advanced troubleshooting. My fear in making multiple copies of the course is that, if we change the \"best practice\" for how to upload, I have to make sure all three instances are updated. Our product and industry change so fast and so often that making sure instance of the information is the same seems unlikely. That's why I want that module thing. Does that clarify things? As for the tracking, I have activity completion turned on and have been using the gradebook. I'm wondering if there's a clear way for the student to see their progress. Like, if they have completed 5 of the 10 required courses, a place they can see they're at 50%.",

I say that since you seem to imply that people can choose additional courses beyond what their managers have chosen. Moodle does not having true tracking at the site level except for the grading functionality, which does not seem like the right way for you. However, look at the customizable reports.

Now...as for customizable reports...I use the configurable reports plugin.  I did have to learn sql ...but honestly, a one day training (to be fair, I already knew how to write rudimentary Crystal Reports, so that helped and I'd spent a good bunch of time looking at Moodle tables) isn't too bad for being able to design some decent reporting.  And there are some pre-writen reports available that are pretty good.  Most of the reports I use started out as reports available on the Configurable Reports thread.  And you can set them up to only run for the specific individual (transcript) or specific department/groups or all (for you).  I have a my employees report that allows supervisors to view a list of their staff and look at their individual transcripts which is quite popular (you have to assign the supervisor to the employee profile, which might take time but isn't hard).  Technically it is two reports but...it works. Core moodle does have an overview report which will show individual people and all the courses...it is clumsy to get to, though.  Through the grade book and the user must be enrolled.",

I have around 90-100 MP4 videos, which I want to ( batch?) upload into Moodle and have each of these videos serve as either a course or a part of a course. I am looking for recommendations for: Plugins or modules that give me the capability to record a presentation, or a screen recorder that can save directly back into Moodle. A way to bulk upload each of my videos and tag them after they've been uploaded. And any other video recommendations people may have. Thank you! Brawta",

For background information, I am told that the bulk of the contant in this LMS will be short videos - now and always. I was basically told that a colleague of mine would be going to town on creating video content, while I built the LMS out. Now that they're done creating the videos, it's as if someone plopped down a stack of papers on my desk and said \"go file these\". Each of the videos can be categorized based on our product lines - which is around 5. I am not a native English speaker, so I am doing my best here with my words. I've set up L,MS's before, but mostly home-grown systems. Moodle is new to me. Along with English. So basically I need to organize these 90 or so videos, and I want to do it in Moodle, and I just want to get some pointers as to the best plugin to use. Hopefully this additional information is helpful for anyone kind enough to help out with a few tips. Thank you, Brawta",

Put it this way, you bulk upload all the videos, what do you expect to see then? If they will just be resources on the course page you could just drag and drop each file into the location you want it to appear in the course page. See here: https://www.oit.umass.edu/support/moodle/about-adding-resources-a-moodle-course If you want them to be just on the server , so that later you can add them to quizzes or other areas of Moodle as you build learning content, then you want to use the File System Repository. You can just upload ( ftp /sftp) to a directory on the server and access the files from within Moodle. http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/File_system_repository There might be an integrated screen capture tool for Moodle, but I am not aware of it. People ask me about it sometimes. Personally I take the screencast using Quicktime or Screencast-o-matic and either upload it to my course , or to YouTube and link to it from there. That workflow may not be so appropriate if you are expecting students to make the screencasts though.",

          "Text": "I see. It is helpful to try to structure your vision in Moodle terms . Either each product = 1 course or There is just a single course, and each product = 1 course section In either case the videos will just be \" activities \" within a section of the course. You probably should play around with Moodle a bit to get familiar with all that. There are a number of course formats (grid, single topic etc) that you can use to make the layout of a course close to how you want. So check out the course format section of the Moodle plugins database . To embed your videos, here are three ways way 1 Upload and embed the video into a \"label\" ( under \"add activity/resource\" when in edit mode.) Sadly, then the video player itself will be right on the course page and there won't be a thumbnail. way 2 Use the label, but just display the thumbnail image in the label , and link it to a separate resource/page( under \"add activity/resource\" when in edit mode.)  that contains the video. I don't want to overwhelm you with info, so I will leave it there, but later you would need to hide that resource page so it is only accessible via the thumbnail. way 3 Forego the label approach, and just add a resource/page with your video file in it, and in the description area for that page add the thumbnail. Then check the \"display description on course page\" checkbox. You probably have the most flexibility with way 2, because you could put several thumbnails on one label etc. There are other ways to do all this too, but perhaps you should play around a little and then you will have a better idea of the difference between how it works, and how you want it work.",

          "Text": "Yes, there is. Some years ago, I did it in the following way: Look at the list of import formats and the list of export formats. Find some formats that you can both import and export. Create in Moodle 1-3 questions of the type you would like to import. Do not make it too difficult. Choose one type of questions, especially the straightforward onces that might become your big time saver. Export these questions while using the formats identified in item 1. Open the exported files to study their structure. Look for a format that has a clear structure like: <fixed lines of xml text><your question><more xml text><your correct answer><again xml><your first wrong answer><and more xml><your second wrong answer><and again xml>. Select the format that looks most appropriate. You are going to prepare an import file for that format now. Create an excel file with (e.g.) ten columns: reserved for first xml text your question reserved for second xml text your correct answer reserved for third xml text your first wrong answer reserved for fourth xml text your second wrong answer reserved for fifth xml text wait, I will explain below Fill column 2, 4, 6, 8 with your questions and answers. Fill column 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 with the various xml texts (the same on each line) Place a formula in the cells of column 10 that concatenates the texts of all earlier columns, e.g.. =A1&B1&C1&D1 etc., maybe you have to add some spaces her and there as well. Copy the tenth column to a text file (Notepad) Maybe you have to copy some fixed lines at the start and/or at the end from your export example file as well. Import your text file. It sounds like a world trip. However, I had to enter 300 questions. When I did it in the interactive way, I didn't like it anymore after 3 questions. It was so time consuming and boring. Then, I figured out the \"world trip\" described above. Peace of cake!",

Yes, for a normal installation of moodle we will probably have to do that but as I said above we use Fortiweb for SSL offloading (in reverse-proxy mode) wich means that Fortiweb acts as the SSL/TLS terminator wich bears the load for encryption processing instead of the web server using the web server's certificate. Therefore from what is written in this page in my case we should only set $ CFG-> sslproxy to 1 in the config.php file and not use SSL because it is Fortiweb that is responsible for encrypting and decrypting with the moodle server certificate that we have to upload in Fortiweb anyway, I will set up this solution and we will see",

I do not understand why, I had to do all this, we have Fortiweb which is configured to make SSL offloading ie the moodle server does not use its own server certificate. Instead, FortiWeb acts like an SSL proxy for the web server, possessing the web server’s certificate and using it to: authenticate itself to clients decrypt requests encrypt responses and according to this doc I will only have to put $ CFG-> sslproxy to 1 and not use ssl in the moodle server . anyway, I do not master Fortiweb at all, I am discovering it, maybe I have misconfigured or I have not configured some things, or this document does not apply to my version of Moodle (3.0) Thank you all for your help",

          "Text": "Hi all, This is my first post, and I'm fairly new to Moodle (although I am a PHP dev), so please bare with me. I've just installed Moodle 2.9 on our internal server , hooked it up to Active Directory, installed a theme, created a course and so on fine. I've just tried to log on with an Active Directory student account and noticed a couple of undesirable things: 1. User profile settings on initial logon How can we bypass the initial profile update screen on a users first logon? We don't want any user editing any of their profile information. This moodle installation is going to be strictly for courses, nothing social. In addition, we definitely don't want students to have the power to update their own name. We only want network administrators to be able to edit user information, so keep it consistant across all our systems. 2. Email Addresses are required Why are email addresses required? We don't want students to be able to enter personal email addresses, and the don't have school emails (yet). Staff do have emails, but again, we don't want them to be able to change them themselves. How can I stop users being able to edit the email field 3. Sending emails on initial logon Again, we don't want emails be sent by moodle to any user. Even if they forget their password, or username or whatever. If they need a password reset, they contact the network admins. If they have an issue with a course, they can contact their teachers directly. There is absolutely no need (from what I can see) for Moodle to be sending out emails. Again, how can we disable this feature. Thanks for your time. Phil",

For the example in a previous versione Moodle the city was required.

We provide both the URL and embed code for redundancy in case one does not work.

          "Text": "Hi Chye. Yes I agree, it does seem that the auto_increment_increment is the one causing this. If you are using master-master database, the two settings we are discussing cannot probably be changed. It has been a while since I've looked closely at this, but I do not think Moodle supports Master-Master database setup. In fact it broke Moodle on older versions a few years ago when master-master db is used, and more than one front-end web application servers are accessing two different databases. If you are using Moodle with master-master databases in this way, you probably cannot safely change the increment settings. To this point, it is also highly dependent on what type of replication is being used between the two databases. At this point I would recommend some caution. Find out if you are using a master-master db setup, where both master databases are being used simultaneously. I think it is important to understand this before making any changes. Also a database backup will be very important to have before making changes. The reason I am advising so much caution is because the id numbers are so critical to Moodle. If you are not using multiple databases with master-master, and it is currently working fine, perhaps no change is needed. Though based on my experiences from a few years ago, I don't recommend using auto_increment_increment. If you have a \"young\" site that is not in production, or just in \"testing/evaluation\" phase, then perhaps starting with a clean slate, a fresh install, is in order. My worry is that continuing as-is may end up with irreversible and unrecoverable damage to the db. Again this all depends on: if you are actually using a master-master setup, if both masters are being used simultaneously, what replication engine is being used, Moodle version, plugins that may behave differently, and probably more considerations. I would like to find more recent information on Moodle and auto_increment_increment. I did a quick search and didn't find what I was looking for, something more from a very technical developer perspective.",

However, once I have taken a laptop to my office and logged in from there, when I take the laptop to any other location, every page in the site is either very slow to load or times out. The problem occurs in IE , Firefox , and Chrome. I have stopped and restarted the DNS Service and done a DNS flush, as well as having our IT department flush the DNS cache on our work servers. I have also run the event viewer, and no errors show up there. I ran a tracert, and it looks like the error is right in the machine. It takes a very long time for the ping to get from the machine to my router, or it times out altogether. A straight ping of the URL shows the correct IP address. This problem started to occur after my moodle host moved the site two weeks ago. Prior to that we had no problems. I believe the problem is related to some ghost of the old DNS addresses. The site has only been active for about 50 days, so I am sure this is not a logs issue, but I have reduced my user logs to 90 days anyways.

At this point I was able to log into the site and do many things, just not create directories or upload files. I installed a fresh copy of 1.4.2 (moodle-latest) and then was receiving the  \"Internal Server Error\" on the main page and could not access my site at all. The server tech reset permission for me (755) and all seemed ok. I could login and do things. The this afternoon I could not login and had to change permissions on a few files to allow me to login, and all files in my data directory became 755 and I had to have them reset. Any ideas??

I know that would be a very silly joke but I´ve heard that there should be some silly people in this world. Some permissions changed in my moodle,too. Perhaps you may not change all to 755? Do I understand you right, when the permissions changed you couln´t reach your site? If you don´t come in to moodle, you can use a ftp -programm to change your files. My moodle is installed on a server, too. With this ftp I reach all my files and folders and also can change the permissions. I live in germany, so I don´t know canadian programms. I use wise-ftp. It´s not the best I think, but it works. Greetings from Heiko,Germany",

I've managed to get the server running again by deleting a few files, but the database restart gives this error: Incorrect key file for table '/tmp/# sql _ba4_0.MYI'; try to repair it I can now log back into Moodle BUT the forums site news does not load. I've placed the site into maintenance mode whilst we try figure out what is going on here. I've looked at the various forums and  I suspect this is all related to lack of disk space which we are working on. I'm curious though as to what has taken all the space - could there have been some sort of injection attack as part of the DoS that has blown out the mySQL database size. Rather than speculate too much, I've got some hard and fast questions that would be useful for some advice of possible: My /var/moodledata/ directory is 120GB - this is largely made of video files from one dance teacher that uploaded them into Moodle directly rather thanusing a video streaming site like YouTube. I have her migrating these videos to ETV.org.nz which will then be embedded rather than hosted on our server. If I delete her course will it delete the associated video files in Moodle or will it leave them in her personal repository? Is it possible to directly delete content within /var/moodledata/ ? The /var/moodledata/temp directory is around 16GB - can I manually flush this, or does that impact on Moodle's performance? Any easy ways to tell the size of the mySQL database directly? Any help with this would be greatly appreciated Regards, Sam",

So what do I need to do to change a user photo?  And if everyone else is seeing a laughing face with this post instead of a puzzled one, what do I need to do so my display updates?

          "Text": "Moodle 1.94 - Embedded Video in Labels slows page load Searched for solutions to this, but can't seem to find an answer. Background: We have several courses (12 weeks long) that contain multiple embedded videos ~10 videos.  I have been placing the videos in the course via inserting a new label (view HTML) , and then copy/pasting the embed code from various - usually youtube. Typical code looks like this: <iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2uJN3Z1ryck\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> or <iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lVzMhwwAO74\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> These videos display/play great in the courses. The issue: When loading the course page in any browser (with all 12 weeks visible), the page will take much longer to load (5-10 seconds) if the videos are embedded, compared to the same course with no videos (loads under a second).  While this 5-10 second load is occurring I can see the browser progress hanging on getting the video content from youtube or wherever. So the issue is one of the Moodle page (or the browser) waiting to get certain content before loading the rest of the page.  Is there anyway to code/tell Moodle to simultaneaous load these items rather than wait for video1, before going to video 2......etc.etc. Ken",

You can, AFAIK , only delete users from the Moodle by removing them manually from the database . The problem is that you always miss something. This causes orphan records, or part records, and will likely crash your database eventually, if there are enough orphan strings or part records. The idea is you can remove a student from a course but if the student retakes that course, they have access to work they have already completed.",

They use Blackboard, but I am using Moodle for special needs students for my capstone project. So . . . I'm turning to my fellow K-12 Moodlers for help! So is anybody out there, with all the free time they have as educators, willing to answer some questions for me? I have been using Moodle for almost eight years. Let me know by reply, as I need to have this done in the next week and a half. Here are some of the questions I would ask: 1. How long has your online program used Moodle, did you switch from another CMS? If so, why did you switch to Moodle? 2. Is your program a major transfer of classes from facd-to-face to online? If so, how did you train traditional classroom teachers to transfer their classes to online. 3. Do you have official professional development courses to train teachers on how to use Moodle, transfer courses, give tech support? If so, do you hold face-to-face workshops or do you use Moodle? 4. What kind of tech support is available at your institution? In your opinion, is it effective for the teachers? For the students? 5. How involved are your parents involved in your online learning program? Do you have parent accounts? 6. How do you ensure that your courses are as accessible as possible for disabled students? Do you follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)? 7. How do you host your online program? If hosted locally, do you have proper server space, memory, and broadband access for your online program? Who is in charge of the server? 8. How do you assess the effectiveness of a particular course? The entire program? 9. What is the workload of an online instructor vs. a traditional face-to-face instructor? Do they receive more or less compensation? Is tenure affected by whether an instructor teaches online or not? 10. Do you have a blended or online only program? 11. Are your courses using media-rich content? If not, why? If so, do you have problems with compatibility? 12. Do you integrate third party Web 2.0 tools in your program? If not, why? 13. Who owns the course content in your program, the institution or the instructor? 14. How does your institution monitor fair-use, plagiarism and copyright infringement. 15. What provisions/accommodations do you make for LD students? Sincerely, Jamey Barber jbarbercsueb@gmail.com",

My courses are too short for anyone to bother uploading one and I think the smiley face with the glasses looks really unprofessional on a site that charges for courses. b) Is there a system wide method  for me to stop Moodle from sending any emails (other than the authentication one) to my students? Again my students are only coming to do a few short courses which don't require any interaction with other students so I don't want to bombard them with irrelevant emails. I guess I could just turn off the forums in each course but I think they can be useful. Thanks Jared",

Then I  try  to create a new question(i fill the form, past images from my disk, then  save and so on ),  I  can see my question with image (in a preview window) then  I click  Preview icon. bu t the site  doesn’t show  image of my new question (only text) at the list of questions (Question Bank page), I can not understand  what is the matter? The second question -How to  add questions (from question bank) to quiz/test (at course)? And at last is there the files menu (like in old versions of moodle) and  how can I find it there? Thank you in advance for any comments! Best regards!!",

          "Text": "Hello. I am using Moodle version 3.1 on a server with Linux 4.9.51, and our users are reporting that after setting their password and logging in for the first time, upon the next login their password has changed and they are unable to log in. When I check the report logs, I can see the following message for each user after their first login: \"The user with id X changed the password of the user with id Y\" The origin for this log entry is \"cli\", and these entries tend to occur in bulk at the same time, always on times ending on some multiple of \"15\", leading me to believe that it is a scheduled task that is updating user passwords after their first login, preventing them from logging in again. We upload users in bulk and create password and send via email, but do not force password change. I am wondering how to disable the user password update after their first login? I am having trouble narrowing it down to what is causing this, even if I suspect it is caused by a scheduled task.",

I see them as not only performing user password updates, but sending out the automated emails about Moodle updates when I review the logs. I have checked our scheduled tasks, but the last run time for the ones related to the users/accounts and passwords all match the logs, or else are more recent than the logs, for last runtime, and their Next Run is scheduled as \"ASAP\", even though it has been over four days since the last run for all of them. For reference, the last incident I see in my logs of a user password update is 2/4 at 12:00 am, which is the last run time for about half of my scheduled tasks. I also do not know if a scheduled task could have run more recently than that time and simply not found any new users to update the passwords of, in which case it would not register in the logs. Checking those that are scheduled to run on 15 minute increments, the only one that matches the criteria of both having run at or more recently than the last incident of password reset and acting on 15 minute intervals is \"Global search index optimization\", which does not sound like the likely culprit from the name alone. For reference, these are the scheduled tasks that sound relevant to users/accounts that I see that have run at, or more recently than the last incident of a user password update: - Send New user Passwords - Send Failed Login Notifications - Cleanup Password Reset Attempts The full list is much longer and includes scheduled tasks that from their descriptions don't sound like they are the cause of the problem, such as \"Background processing for caches\". Poking through the back end, I have also begun to try to follow instances where user_password_updated.php is called, which is the source of the message that appears in the logs, to try to see if I can find out what might be calling it for this particular issue, though I haven't had success with this so far.",

Check your host for the maximum of Mb's to be uploaded. Mine allows a max of 64 Mb. You need to change the php.ini file in order for the system to accept larger files. If you can't find it request your host to make it available to you. Look for this string in php.ini: \n```text\n; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.\n\n\npost_max_size = ##M\n\n\n where ## presents your current max size\n```\n Apply the changes and save the file. Copy this file into ALL the subdirectories of your moodle. Once done you can upload larger files. Hope this helps.",

I had manual enrollments int he settings ticked, so I went and made self enrollment an option and now each new student must enrol first and they appear in the course completion settings. Luckily all who made progress in the course had their progress saved so when they next entered the course they were forced to enrol first whcih brought their progress along with them into the course completion tab. all worked out fine.",

What I recently found is that if a user is enrolled in multiple courses and has accessed at least 1 of them, that user will not show up in this report.  From what I can tell it is because of the test for \"u l . timeaccess IS NULL \"(where ul is prefix_user_lastaccess .  So in reality this is limiting it to only users that have never logged in. Does anyone have an idea as to how to change this query so that it checks if an enrolled user has actually started a course versus logging into the system? Below is the query from the documentation. SELECT user2 . id AS ID , ul . timeaccess , user2 . firstname AS Firstname , user2 . lastname AS Lastname , user2 . email AS Email , user2 . city AS City , user2 . idnumber AS IDNumber , user2 . phone1 AS Phone , user2 . institution AS Institution , IF ( user2 . lastaccess = 0 , 'never' , DATE_FORMAT ( FROM_UNIXTIME ( user2 . lastaccess ) , '%Y-%m-%d' ) ) AS dLastAccess",

Now, I want to add new functionalities to my web service. For this work, I need to use new PHP files with some class, function and constants, but I don't know how to reference this PHP files from my webservice (from my externallib.php file). I use the typical \"require_once $CFG-> dirroot .'./lib/utils.php';\", but it doesn't work. I think that when install the new webservices, Moodle does not upload the librari folder. One solution that works is to use $CFG->dirroot variable to point the Moodle local folder that is where I put the new webservice to install in Moodle: require_once $CFG->dirroot.'/local/ws_myservice/lib/utils.php'; Is the solution that I have used correct? Is another better solution? I think that must have another better solution because the webservice is not running from the local folder, Moodle install the webservice in another place.

You could do this on your Moodle home page or perhaps in a dedicated course for your local Moodle News. That way, you can add details of changes in your Moodle, new courses etc as forum/blog postings which can be fed out to other RSS clients (e.g. desktop RSS clients, other websites, Mahara e-portfolio, even RSS client blocks elsewhere in Moodle). In order to make use of RSS feeds produced by Moodle, they need to be enabled by an administrator. Enable RSS feeds for the site in Settings > Site administration > Advanced features Enable RSS feeds for database activities , forums and/or glossaries in Settings > Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules In the settings for the individual activity you can then select the number of entries you would like included in the RSS feed. See http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Category:RSS for more details on RSS feeds in Moodle. Hope that helps.",

I have now put everything into one calendar.css file (attached) so that all the settings are together.  The only other change needed is to fusion/config.php where you add to line 61 (in this case) that you're using calendar.css. To make it even easier for you, I've attached the two files as a zip file that have the changes for the fusion theme. Sorry about the terrible colours that come out - our corporate colours that I'm stuck with - but hopefully it will get you started. Just remember this is for moodle 2.0 and theme designer mode must be on at least until you set the colours to what you want. Regards George",

I'm trying to develop a portal where more than one university will be involved and enrollments are going on the basis of those universities. Here the basic idea is to categorize Moodle users with its University. Following are my questions, requirements and research. University A has 50 users (Students). Manager of University A can create course and all 50 members (students) will be automatically enrolled in that course. I took a deep look at Moodle LMS and found the \"Cohorts\" section which can do this part with \"Cohort Sync\" enrollment method. University A and University B have to pay certain amount to site owner (No Payment Integration needed just a database field with cohort ID and rate would work). I may need to create a local plugin to extend Moodle. (Any other way would be appreciated.) How do I assign roles based on Cohort (University)? For e.g. University A Manager will have full authority to create course, adding students, initiate forums but University A Manager should not have permission to view/edit/delete University B Manager's section. Please note that, University is nothing but Cohort in Moodle.",

The Left Column has general training info, Category block, and Course block. The Middle Column contains the course list. The Right column contains the calendar. When a student first logs in, they are sent to the MyMoodle page (that is, the url has /my). However, only the Middle Column appears. The Left and Right columns do not. And so, the students are stuck just looking at one long ugly list of courses. (They're not even grouped into categories!). This is a problem because we'll probably have 40 courses soon. When a student selects a course however, then they are on the Course page and they see the layout just fine. So the Sticky blocks set for the Course page works, but not for the MyMoodle page.  Any ideas on what could be wrong?",

'hiding' the excercise module  - this worked. c. upgrading the excercise module - this seems to work also. The excercise module is not a part of the standard distribution. So you need to check regularly if there are new versions. I'm no expert, so I do not know for sure which of the 3 suggestions is the best one. The most doubts I have on a). Perhaps someone else has a definitive solution. .feike.",

When a user on a Windows (XP or 2000) client tries to download the file it takes forever (3-5 min on machines on the same speed connection and swtich as the server). Im not sure about dialup, but Im sure it is slow as well. The funny thing is that when a Mac users tries to download it takes about 3 secs (same speed connection and switch as the server). I know that the way Windows and Macs handle downloading pdfs is a little differnt, but there should not be that big of a speed difference. I am going to try and set up a method to download the file outside of moodle tommorrow and change the resource to a weblink to the file instead of the uploaded file option and see how that works.

The logs show that it is not downloading twice. The double download problem only occurs so far on a mac with IE. So what I did was created a download directory in the sites root and have changed the resource from an uploaded file to a webpage and put the link in. The speed is improved, but not what is should be (now around a min. compared to 3-5 min before). Either way I have it set up, the speeds when downloading on a mac are much faster (less that 10 seconds, even when IE downloads twice). So I feel that this is probably not a moodle or a server problem, but a problem with the way XP and 2000 and Acrobat handle pdf files from a web page(which to me has always been a little slow).

The moodle was already installed and appeared to be working.  1.94 ruining on a virtual host with 5.2.8, Apache /2.0.63 mysql 5.0.67 . moodledata (correctly in the root) file folder permissions are 777 My first clue of trouble was when I went to upload a pic and it failed. GD was not enable. Got that taken care of. Looked at config php and deleted a return at the end. Now pix do upload and display. Here's the weird part, I go to files ( front page of in a classroom) and I get a blank page. I ran a backup with the intention of seeing what that does and it completes I can see the backup inside of files when I access the files through the cpanel. When I hit continue after backup completes I hit a blank page again. I am of two minds. There is an instinct to finish the class and run but I can't just let this ride. I contacted her that I think she needs an upgrade since that fixes odd behavior so often. She says they did that 2 weeks ago so she is not interrested. So does anyone have a specific idea of what would cause this?",

I also noticed that this corresponded with whether or not you could see this course's events on the site-level calendar. If the course shows up on the filter, then it functions properly, and course events that are added can be seen at the site-level. If the filter doesn't show that course, then that course's events will not show on the site level (only for administrators if you add the setting under admin panel). Is this a bug? Thanks,",

SO, can anyone tell me why using a RESTRICTED ACCESS block in a forum to limit access to the forum to users with a specific DEPARTMENT (field name is selected from a pull down list) where the users have the same department name value (and DEPARTMENT is a user profile field) would cause the problem noted in the original post above? If the department value was mis-keyed (e.g. TWO not TOO) I would anticipate the restricted access condition would just fail because the field values were different.  But the error message says - 'user profile field does not exist'.  But, but, but - I selected the field from the pull down list Moodle provided.

I realize this post is lots late but...to find score/points stuff for quiz--go to  the quiz, click Edit Quiz (not quiz settings) and you'll see your max grade and the grade for each question.  You can also go to the Grades area and edit individual activity grades to indicate a grade to pass (you may have to expand it--grade to pass is hidden by default, I think)... this will change course completion from blue check to green check.  Depending on how other things are set up, it may give a red X for non-passing scores. Some of your display issues may be related to theme.  Different themes do different things and you just have to find the one that works best for you.",

          "Text": "Not as such, but.. I would suggest you download a copy of it and install it, just not for your production site. Play with it.. get used to it, so that when it does come you will have an idea of what to expect. Given the overall complexity of the project and the enormous technical challenges of the product, what has been achieved is excellent. I suspect this is such a quantum leap in so many areas, I would not be surprised if there is no production version of Moodle 2.0, and Moodle 2.1 becomes the first. You cannot make this kind of change without there being some hitches. Remember that Windows 94 became Windows 95 (and ME became Multiple Errors, but XP did not become Extra Problems, Vista barks and 7.. well the jury is still out...) and they have billions behind them. Martin is doing this on a lot of goodwill and not a lot of cash, so patience is really required. I agree that simmering excitement is hard to contain, and disappointment over unfulfilled expectations will hurt Moodle, but even with what I have seen.. WOW!!! I hope it comes soon, but \"soon\" may not come that quickly. I am just sorry I cannot offer anything more than a kind word of encouragement to the development team.",

If there is 1 member or 150 members, the entire group gets assigned the role. As an additional example: We have 15 instructors. Create a global group called \"Instructors\" which has all the instructors or just those chosen. Then when in the classroom, under \"Assign roles\" there could be two listings; all members and all global groups. Then by choosing either an individual or a group, the system installs them. This procedure could save time and energy. So, What'ch think? Harvey",

Perhaps the easiest I can think of is to use the meta-course functionality to manage the enrolments of your groups - yours would be scenario 2 where you have a (probably hidden) course for each group (eg \"From New Jersey\") of students then individual meta-courses for each required class. The Meta-course functionality needs to be enabled at site level and works by filtering the enrolments from any child courses (the 'From New Jersey' course) to the meta-course/s (the required class courses).

          "Text": "Teresa, Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately it doesn't solve our problem. We have approximately 450 members from all over the world, on our site. Let's say that 20 or so individuals from one area get together and form a \"Study Group.\" And let's say that we have 30 different classes that we teach on line. This study group purchases access to class number 1 for \"X\" dollars. When we receive notice that a Study Group has purchased the course a single user (or the group name), the one who paid for the course will log in and project the course material via a projector and everyone within the group learns together. When the students are ready to take the exam, the teacher/administrator goes to the exam room for this course and assigns the role of student to the group. The role assignment within the classroom/course, recognizes the entry is a group then adds the individuals from the group to the course. Imagine the amount of time it would take to add 50 students to a particular course and then to do it again a few weeks later for another course, then again and again. Look at the amount of time that would be saved if the software could do it directly from the global group; create the global group once and use it where ever an individual can be used. Then as each individual passes the exam, remove them from the course after recording their results. To create a global group: Add new user to \"List of Users\" if the individual isn't already a member. Then from \"Site Administration/Users/Accounts\" and below \"Add a new user\" have another item called \"Add a new Group.\" The group item should contain the same items as an individual; name, password etc. Once the group is created, the window opens to list all groups and all members. Members can be added or removed from the groups here as well. The teacher/administrator then chooses the group and clicks all the members who are to be part of the group. Members can be in more than one group. As far as logging in to the site, the name of the group and its password will be like an individual logged in. That way any member of the group can initiate the log in and then the group can purchase a class or classes. The only difficulty that I see from a programming stance it the possibility that two or more groups is placed into the same classroom and a user happens to be in both groups, therefore showing two instances within the classroom of the same person. Not being familiar with open source, but having been a computer programmer for many years, I don't believe the coding could be all that difficult. True, additional items will need to be added to the DB (Groups and the membership within) plus coding to test for duplicates but \"Wouldn't it be Loverly?\"",

          "Text": "Tony, it's hard to comment based on the information you have supplied.  How fast is fast how slow is slow, how many people are logging in? is it 10, 20 100 etc. Later versions of Moodle deliver much more functionality and so require more hardware, something that some Google searches on Moodle performance comparison will help with. However one thing is for certain, the performance of code on shared hosting such as Bluehost will vary according to what other people are doing on the same machine. So if another user of that web space suddenly gets popular by having a page linked on Slashdot (or whatever) all bets on performance is off for everyone else on that machine. It might be nothing to do with the version of Moodle and everything to do with some other user of the web space getting a big surge in hits. This would explain why the performance varies.  I use very cheap hosting (£GBP 50 per year) and the performance is generally fine for about 20 users, but I am entirely aware that sometimes the performance might drop to unusable and that is the cost of cheap. Touch wood this has rarely happened.",

We upgraded of Moodle version from **** to **** with Moodle sessions handled by the database. Since this migration, from time to time, one webserver unexpectedly consumes all the connections to the database. When it occurs, a \"show full processlist\" mysql command shows that no sql requests are made by any connections. Moodle is then blocked and the error shown is \"too many connections to the database\". Our max allowed connection is set to 200. Because the moodle cron scripts are executed only on one webserver, we can exclude them as being the cause. We are thinking that the handling of the sessions can be one possibility. Do you have any track or ideas about this issue ? Thanks a lot !",
