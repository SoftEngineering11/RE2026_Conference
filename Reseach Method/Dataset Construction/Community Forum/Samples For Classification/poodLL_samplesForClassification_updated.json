          "Text": "Hello everybody, hello Justin, We have been using Poodll, this great tool for language teaching, for four years now, and it's really fabulous. There are so many things you can do with it, especially get students of foreign languages to speak, which is not an easy task given that they are often very numerous in a university class... Wo use Read Aloud a lot, but I'm new to Minilessons, and haven't been using the widgets much either. So here's the question: in some cases, like in Minilesson or Speechcards, Poodll seems to consider my answers as incorrect how ever hard I try. In the Speechcards items I get like two stars out of three but I'm stuck there (I would love to use this to create structural exercises like Does he like it?|Yes he does - that's a great additional possibility!). I can't see any settings to configure the way it is graded, like I do in Read Aloud - would anyone know if that's possible, and how to do it? Thank you!",

Another possibility if you have the PoodLL Repository set it up is to set the assignment to allow for feedback files.

Student reads a question Student records an answer with PoodLL Student compares their own answer to a model answer in \"general Feedback\" Student grades their answer (so the Teacher doesn't have to\") Steps 1 through 3 are obviously already standard quiz steps. The fourth is important for me since the objective of the exercise I'm trying to build is the checking of the answer (and not necessarily the answering). I realize this is probably a general Moodle question rather than PoodLL specific, but since I got no answer in the general Moodle forums, I thought maybe another PoodLL user had experienced the same need.",

I think this is because we use the Amazon AWS SDK in Poodll, and Moodle does some verification on the code, and there is a lot of code. Can you check what the reported max execution time on your site is when you visit: Site admin -> server ->php info It should be 90 or more. If you really can't get past this, I am happy to look into it for you. But in that case you should start a ticket via https://poodll.com/contact . Then we will be able to share passwords etc in private.",

Some students created a Poodll video with their ipads which converted properly and was visible when the students posted it to a forum (Moodle 3.2). I saw the video playing. However, now it isn't visible. All that shows in the forum window is \"upfile_468814434.mov\". In the html I can see \"<p><img src=\"https://XXXXXX.XXXXXX.xxxxxxx.ac.jp/draftfile.php/5/user/draft/851821148/upfile_468814434.mov\" alt=\"upfile_468814434.mov\">\" which means it should be showing doesn't it?

          "Text": "Hi Eric As a super Poodll 3 guy you can, and probably should, send support requests via the contact form at https://poodll.com/contact or send email directly. The reason is that in Poodll 3 there is a support info file that you can generate. That tells me all your versions and settings, and it speeds things up. Find that at: site admin -> plugins -> filters -> poodll -> support info ( I think its probably best not to attach it to forum posts. ) To answer your question. It sounds like \"cloud recording\" is off. In that case the mov file has not been sent to the Poodll cloud conversion service. So it is stuck a mov file. Try turning on \"cloud recording\" on the Poodll filter general settings page. This is really the best thing to do. You could maybe play ,mov file back as is.  As long as the player selected was good with mov files. You could try the Media Element Video player in Poodll. This page explains how to set up Video JS, but the principles are the same for Media Element Audio. https://poodll.com/poodll-3-docs/video-js/ Finally there is a Poodll App these days. Read about that here, https://poodll.com/poodll-3-docs/using-the-poodll-mobile-app/ That makes it easier to record audio/video off iOS devices. But it also works best with cloud recording. So you should have that enabled.",

Also, when we attempted to submit an audio assignment, the recorder would appear, the audio would be recorded and could be listened to but when submitted, the recorder showed up again on screen and the page was still loading (spinning).  I noticed a brief glance of some debug information and realized that moodle was set to debug email sending.  If I stopped the page, and went back to view the assignment, the audio was uploaded and working (blue flow player).  When I turned the debug off, it appeared to work. Also, for some reason, a tester indicated that they were unable to use the recorder but then it started working.  I know this is minimal information but is it possible that cache needed to be cleared or permissions for player needed to be accepted? Any advice would be appreciated.  If I have more additional comments, I will add them. Thanks Eric",

          "Text": "Hi Eric Sorry for the slow reply. Those error messages about .png files can be ignored and they are annoying. I think I removed those in the latest version. The other issues are a bit hard to pin down. Sometimes debug and other output can get mixed up in what should be meaningful ajax responses and even into the recorded files themselves. Of course this shouldn't really happen but I have seen it before. I would consider this not a likely cause of the other problems you reported. There are many ways recording can fail, let me count the ways The recording timed out during upload The user's mic device is not recognized or not available The user has not given permission via various popup dialogs to access mic device The recording can't be uploaded due to bandwidth or network issues There are file permission issues on the PoodLL files There is a bug in PoodLL somewhere There is not really a problem, but the user thinks there is The file is recording ok, but its in a format that can't be played back The PoodLL filter settings are to convert with FFMPEG but ffmpeg is not set up PHP security settings, mod-security or suhosin are killing the file upload And that won't be all of them. So its a bit of a minefield at times. Its most likely a permissions, network or device issue. Try really short recordings, and see if they work. If they do, and big long ones don't, then try using the red5 audio recorder (ie not the mp3 one).",

The Atto PoodLL Anywhere buttons will let you do recordings in the forum, database , glossary, newest version of journal, or just about anywhere you can use the Atto editor. All of those options allow for easy deletion. If you also install the PoodLL repository plugin, then you can also do recordings with the Podcast (pcast) plugin, which was my favorite way of having students submit recordings.",

          "Text": "Hello Community; I am struggling to get consistent and good performance out of Poodll/Moodle specifically regarding mobile uploads of video assignments. I am evaluating Poodll in a self hosted virtual instance of Moodle, and have found that although small mobile video files under 10MB will generally upload via Poodll and play back without issue on the source device, once the file size exceeds roughly 15-20MB, then things start to fall apart. Background... My use case requires that all students will be submitting assignments via mobile device platforms, which if I understand correctly would be best served by converting submissions via FFMPEG for widest mobile platform compatibility. Therefore, I have built FFMPEG on my test server from sources, and have verified that when called from the system path, it is working correctly. I have also verified via shell command that the FFMPEG switches used on the poodll demo site are working. Therefore, I assume that the Poodll Filter settings to auto convert mobile submissions to MP4 and to use FFMPEG for the conversion are also working, although I have yet to determine how to verify this as I have not seen any entries in any server logs. Back to the problem at hand... Without FFMPEG settings enabled in the Poodll filter, files of any size, up to the server limit of 512MB, will upload from a mobile device without issue. Playback is choppy over mobile data, but plays smoothly via WiFi, suggesting that playback quality is bandwidth dependent. With FFMPEG conversion settings enabled in the Poodll filter, mobile uploads above approximately 15MB in size will cause a browser error on Chrome, or will simply never complete the upload process in Firefox . In Chrome, after selecting a mobile video larger than 15MB to upload, the progress bar never appears and within about 15 seconds Chrome will throw an \"Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage...\" error. In Firefox, after selecting a mobile video to upload larger than 15MB, the progress bar will appear, but no indication of upload activity will be evident and the process never completes. Obviously, in both cases Mobile uploads will fail. Since it is possible to turn on the mobile upload processing error, and turn it off, by enabling and disabling the FFMPEG conversion settings in the Poodll filter, I assume that the root issue is with the filter and not my environment, but I would appreciate some other perspectives or troubleshooting  suggestions on the matter. Moodle is running on a Debian (Jesse) instance, with 2GB of RAM, 60GB HD, and PHP.INI settings that allow up tp 512MB uploads and 640MB of script memory. Regards; Michael",

This will mean that the browser won't wait for the transcoding to finish. It relies on cron to kick off the transcoding. So it won't start till cron runs. Though it does sound like the real issue is with uploading. There are settings that affect uploads on your web server. Apache mod_security and the PHP extension suhosin are two of those. I would look into that. Both of those by default limit the size and nature of uploads.",

The usual suspects are suhosin and mod_security. In php.ini there are also: memory_limit upload_max_filesize post_max_size Apparently the values of those should follow this pattern: upload_max_filesize =< post_max_size =< memory_limit So the simple way is to make them all the same, but upload_max_filesize should never be greater then post max_size, which should never be greater then memory_limit. I am not an expert in this, though I have learned the hard way about some of it. Another thing you might try is recording over at https://demo.poodll.com . This is using the new PoodLL3 and Amazon S3 for uploads. If that all works for you, perhaps PoodLL3 would be a good solution",

          "Text": "After a fair bit of consideration I recently made the decision that PoodLL 3 will be a premium set of plugins. i.e. it won't be free. PoodLL has had great uptake from the Moodle community and the users have been positive through the good times, and patient and understanding through trouble times. So going premium is not something I have taken likely. At its heart is the reality that PoodLL needs a lot of work to make the full transition to HTML5 and for a host of other feature improvements and better support options (incl. documentation). You can read more on an this here: http://poodll.com/?p=2107 It will be available as an annual subscription with 3 tiers of membership: i) individual teacher (aka little guy) ii) single institution/organization iii) partner The pricing and some other details are yet to be decided, but from now on there will be more no more updates published on Moodle.org or the existing GitHub repositories, other than bug and security fixes. In the past I maintained a mailing list of PoodLL users, but these days that list doesn't contain the large majority of users. So currently there is no direct way for me to communicate with the PoodLL user base.  It would be very helpful for me if as a PoodLL user you could take this quick 8 question survey. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/63DJ529",

          "Text": "Hi there, I've just installed the latest version of the filter and the online assignment plugins in my Moodle 3.0.1 site, so students can submit assignments by recording themselves. It all works flawlessly on Chrome and Edge, but on Firefox (v43.0.4, the latest one with the latest flash plugin), it doesn't work. I can start the recording (after giving Flash permission to use my microphone), I then proceed to stop it and I see an \"uploading\" spinning symbol, but when it finishes the recording hasn't been actually saved, nothing plays when I click on the play button of the plugin, or when I save the supposedly recorded audio and use the media player to listen to it. Not even if I submit the assignment. One thing I can tell is different from when I try this same action on Chrome and Edge is that on those browsers, while I speak, the volume bar in the plugin shows feedback (with green and red bars), while on Firefox that doesn't happen. I've been able to test this in a couple computers running Windows 10 and the latest version of Firefox, both with exact same results. In those same computers, using Chrome or Edge works fine. Is this some sort of bug in Firefox (or the plugin) not actually enabling the microphone? Any way around it? Thanks so much in advance for any feedback, this plugin is awesome! Edit: I forgot to mention that I also tried with the audio submission example in the Poodll demo site ( http://demo.poodll.com/mod/assign/view.php?id=87&action=view ) with same exact results, so it's not something related to my Moodle site or my server ...",

I linked the file they send us We installed ffmpeg in the moodle server and we activated the conversion options. Maybe our version of poodll is buggy.

          "Text": "That is not the latest version of PoodLL.  However the later versions are only for Moodle 2.9 and greater. But even if you did upgrade you will still experience some of those problems. Files recorded on your device will not necessarily play back in the same device's browser. For example iPhone records mov files, and Android records different file types depending on the device model. But those are mostly rotten for use in a web environment. PoodLL can't do much about that, except to receive the recordings and then convert them to a better format. You will need to convert them using FFMPEG to a file format that can be played back generically. By email last year I sent you notes on the FFMPEG setup. The javascript whiteboards should work, but there were issues in Moodle 2.8 with Literally Canvas, so please try drawingboard.js. It is one of the options in the PoodLL filter settings. Regarding being logged out when trying to upload, I have heard of this but have not had a chance to look into yet. Justin",

I'll look closely to the file you sent me (definitly forgot about that one oops ! ) There is something in the poodll-red5-webapp (as we are not using tokyo.poodll.com ) that is not compatible with the mp4 conversion in moodle When we activate the ffmpeg conversion for videos in moodle server and we use flash recording to our red5 server,  poodll tries to download from red5 server a mp4 file but it does not call the conversion function before. so there is a flv file but no mp4 file. And I didn't see any error message. we just notice that when accessing to the course that we cannot se the video. We are going to upgrade in april to moodle 3 do you know if  the last version of poodll will be compatible with it. And sorry i didn't answer your last email. I was working on something else and as we are about to update i didn't know if your proposal would be very useful for us. have a nice day Mamadou",

Last week I decide to update Poodll plugin (filter and Question types: Recording) of my moodle. unfortunately all Whiteboards questions didn't work now! When student has completed the whiteboard with their answers, after validation of the question, Moodle tell them that they don't have answer yet. And if teacher try to see student's work, it's the same thing. I try to use all diferent whiteboards : nothing change... modify a question and save it again : nothing change... Also purge all cache of moodle : nothing change... It's the second time I have this problem. First time, to solve it, I do another moodle with an installation of the new plugin poodll and after restore all courses. Actually, I have no time to do this (and I really want to know what's happen and solve the problem).",

Since then I haven't seen anything on this issue.  With the release of Moodle 3.0, this becomes a bit more pressing.  I've nothing against the premium concept, and given how important I find Poodll, I'm principally in favour of the move.  But I would like to know what the situation is. For example, will the current version (which I understand will not be actively supported in future) still work with future Moodle versions?  I guess ony Justin can answer this, but for many people this could be important. Has anyone tried  Poodll with 3.0?  Have there been any issues? Given that a lot of language teachers rely on Poodll in their courses, it would be nice to have an update so that the planning can begin. (If I have missed an article/post about this, then I apologise and would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.) All the best Andy",

          "Text": "Nobody likes to see this. But what should you check when it happens? Well first of all its a general error. And it tells you/the student that your recording will not be saved. That is important. At this point your recording is already gone. There is probably nothing you can do but re record. Things to check i) is the microphone capturing sound? Or the video camera capturing your picture. If not, then there is nothing to submit or convert. And you might get this error. ii) does a very short recording get submitted ok? Sometimes longer recordings have problems at the server or browser level. iii) what recorder are you using? The two audio recorders look similar but are completely different. The video one is different again but in terms of troubleshooting its identical to the red5 audio recorder. MP3 recorder: recordings get less reliable as they get longer. Best not to venture over 2 mins. conversion to MP3 happens before the upload . If the file is too big it might spin forever and give up if the upload begins but throws an error, the connection to the Moodle server is problematic. Check the browser console for errors related to the file being posted. Some servers restrict the upload file size. Thats a whole new ball game, but if thats the case small uploads will be working. audio recorder/video recorder (red5): if you can't play it back after recording.... then the file never arrived on the Red5 server. Check the connection lamp on the recorder. Should be green. If its red or yellow your connection is bad (firewall? ) or the red5 server is down (happens.) If you can play it back, but get the error message above ... then the problem is that your file can't be collected from the Red5 server and copied back into Moodle. Turn off auto convert to mp3/mp4 in the filter settings and try again (or uncheck the mp3/mp4 checkbox on the recorder BEFORE recording). If conversion is the issue then its best to set up FFMPEG on the Moodle server and have PoodLL do its magic with that. Check the port settings in the PoodLL filter settings for HTTP. Your Moodle server will need to be able to do a server to server connection to that port on the  Red5 server to pick up the recorded file.",

Depending on the browser there are two places permissions need to be granted. Flash will show a permissions dialog which can be reshown by right clicking over the recorder and selecting \"settings\" or \"properties\". Chrome and other browsers may have their own permissions dialogs which will be shown after flash tries to access the mic. Other things to check might include that the microphone is plugged in, or if there are multiple microphones in the machine, that the correct one is selected. (again right click ->settings and choose the microphone tab ). Occasionally it is necessary to mess with the microphone tab settings there to spark the microphone into action. I do not know why. Flash is a black box in that regard.",

The second time I try, I can record but it never finishes the upload process...if I let the computer sit, the uploading spinner just continues to spin but never completes, no matter how long or short the video is. We are all selecting .mp4 as video output. I moved the PoodLL filter above multimedia plugins when I did the installation. I have read that the text cache lifetime is no longer an issue for 2.9.1 (Build 20150806) I purged all caches today but to no avail.

One of the biggest problems is that it was very confusing for students because they couldn't tell if their audio actually submitted, as no notification was given, and after saving, they can't see the file there, or listen back to it. The instructor had the same problem in leaving voice feedback for students. Is there anyway for students and instructors to listen to files after they've been submitted? Or for instance if an instructor uses PoodLL to give feedback and two weeks later wants to hear it to remember what they said can they? Currently that doesn't seem available.",

The recorder does allow you to playback the recorded file, and should display an \"uploading\" dialog. And after the page hosting the recorder has been saved, there should be a player (audio or video) in the feedback area for the student ( or on the submission summary if its an assignment submission). And when the teacher returns to the page they should see a recorder for re-recording and a player for listening to the existing feedback recording. If none of that is happening, it should be, and so there is some problem at your end.",

I battled for some time to make the buttons visible to screen readers and in the end found that it was not going to work ... because of limitations of the framework I originally wrote the recorders in. Though it did not occur to me then, since that time I have found a way around those limitations and have implemented it in one of the recorders. Basically by hiding the flash widget and handling all user interaction via html buttons and javascript a far more accessible interface can be made. Effectively we are introducing skinning to PoodLL. It is just a matter of finding the time, to get it all done. But accessibility goes beyond just screen readers, so any comments or advice would be welcome.",

The other recorders require similar work, but at least we have a pattern to go with.

Information on how to do that is here: http://poodll.com/flash-and-poodll/ In short, in the PoodLL filter settings, widgets, players and recorders can be limited to HTML5 only in the \"When to use HTML5\" section. The default whiteboard can be selected in the \"Whiteboard settings\" section. N.B. The non flash whiteboards (LiterallyCanvas and DrawingBoard.js) are not working properly in Moodle 2.9 yet. I am not actually advising anyone to turn Flash off. I will leave that to people more knowledgeable than me.

Or are you doing something else? If you are using PoodLL to record/upload, does it state the file was uploaded successfully?

I am pretty sure you have not set up that, so I think we can ignore that avenue. Let me know if I am wrong though. So the files Moodle is attempting to play will be .mov files. Flowplayer should play those back fine. As of course, should the iPad. But I have seen it go wrong. I would really need to see the uploaded file to check. So here are two things to try. i) turn off the PoodLL filter, and try to reload the page and play the video. Does it work? If so, PoodLL is messing up the playback somehow. If it still doesn't play .. lets do ii) ii) Turn the poodll filter back on. And turn on \"show download link\" beside players  in the PoodLL filter settings. Then there should be a download link by the player when the page is loaded. Download the file to your desktop. Can you play it there? If not, can you post it to me here, or by email, so I can look at it?",

Can you try the same thing into the \"forum(with video)\" activity on http://demo.poodll.com ? (login creds are on the front page ) If it works there, it is a server specific thingy we need to figure out. There might be an error in your logs. If you can find the error log that apache generates, check it and see if there are any recent errors that look related. It can be necessary to turn off or configure a thing called Suhosin. And your server's maximum file upload size could also be a part of the problem. If we are at this point and there is no good error in your server logs, it gets quite complicated unfortunately. If it doesn't work on demo.poodll.com I think that maybe PoodLL has in issue with receiving uploads from your ipad. One thing that I have seen occur, is when people select \"choose existing video\" from the popup dialog, rather than \"take a video.\" The uploaded file is compressed and this can cause problems with the browser/server interaction. The best reply right now to this is to recommend people select \"take a video.\"",

My understanding is that the camera has a definite orientation (Home button should be either down for portrait orientation or on right for landscape), but will flip the preview of the video or photo if held upside down. This flipping will continue if viewing the photo or video on an Apple device. When viewed on other systems - that don't read or understand the encoded \"flip this image\" instructions, the image is displayed as it was recorded - upside down. This became more of a problem when Apple enabled the volume buttons to act as the shutter release. This made it more natural to hold the phone with the shutter release (volume) on top - like a camera. Which is really upside-down. David",

Using a voice recording app said that the generated mp3 uploaded successfully, but Flowplayer won't play it. General questions: When using the HTML5 recording for audio, the Red5 server isn't needed, correct? It's up to the device to provide a file of type audio, and if FFMPEG conversion is installed/configured, that's what translates an ogg or wav to mp3? Is audio likely to be problematic for iPads in the way Eric was experiencing in the other thread? Thanks!",

          "Text": "Hi Hilary. Yes, you are pretty much correct. Red5 is not used when recording with iPads and other mobile devices. The device usually has a \"record now or choose an existing file\" type of file upload dialog. That is out of our control. In the case of iOS there is no \"record audio\" option on that dialog. Just record video. And yes, that means it is hard to predict the file type that will be arriving, though in the case of iOS it is .mov. FFMPEG does the conversion if it is installed and configured. Most PoodLL/Moodles don't have it installed I suspect. Is Audio likely to be problematic, as in Eric's experience. All I can say is \"maybe.\"  As I said in that thread, I now feel that the file upload approach, at least in the way that I have implemented it, is too fragile. The possibility of a student having a device I have not tested on, or sending up a file that doesn't convert, or that doesn't make it through the upload , is quite real. I hope to re work things in the very near future, but for now I think we should assume that recording with mobile devices needs to be handled carefully.",

I do have it installed on my server and it works from the command line. For example, I can transform an ogg file to mp3. However, when I submit the same file via a quiz, it shows conversion (\"Saved: upfile_146395184.mp3\"), but the result won't play in flowplayer. When I dig into the actual file location from the hash table, it's still the ogg file (original size, & if I download & add .ogg it plays, .mp3 won't). The phone voice recorder app creates .amr files; same thing, I can translate with ffmpeg, but what PoodLL names .mp3 and stores seems to still be the amr file. I know this is labeled experimental, but is there something simple I could be missing, like file permissions? It's strange that the conversion does actually work on the one hand, and PoodLL seems to think it has successfully performed it on the other, but the result is not saved. thanks!",

          "Text": "Well. That is interesting. If the mov files convert to mp3 correctly. We would expect that the ogg and amr files should also. The conversion process is the same throughout PoodLL. So it is possible to do the testing for this outside the quiz. If you turn on \"show download link beside players\" in the PoodLL filter settings, a little download arrow will show beside the player. Even if you don't download, rolling your mouse over it should show you the url in your browser status bar. So you will see if it has in fact been converted by noting the file extension. PoodLL will first try to use the FFMPEG that it finds in the [Moodle]/filter/poodll directory. If it doesn't find one there, it will assume there is one available on the path and just bravely call \"ffmpeg -i blahblah.flv blahblah.mp3\" . So it is possible that the ffmpeg you are testing with and the one that PoodLL is using are not the same. It is also possible to set some parameters to the call to ffmpeg. The default is not to, but if you have some set and it might be that they work for mov but muff it for other filetypes. I have attached a document that I use to help people get up to speed with PoodLL and FFMPEG. See if anything in there helps. Also try it out on demo.poodll.com. If it works there, but not on your site, we might be able to see why. Justin",

The link ends in mp3. Downloading the ogg>mp3 file results in a playable file. However, it is smaller (187KB) than the mp3 generated from the same file at the command line (196KB)--which is exactly the same size as the original ogg file. And actually I think it is still an ogg file... if I change the file extension it still plays in Windows Media, because I have the codec for ogg installed. Ahh, I uploaded it to TrID and that says it's indeed an .ogg. I'm attaching it, in case that helps. Downloading the supposed amr>mp3 file won't play as an mp3, but will if I change the file extension. TrID confirms it's still an amr. Also attached. .mov successfully converts to a genuine mp3, and plays in flowplayer. I tried to add \"-report\" in the mp3 options to get a log file on my server but can't get it working... On my server, ffmpeg is in /usr/share/, not in the PoodLL directory. But I installed it when installing PoodLL, so there's only one version to be called. It must be working in a similar fashion to the demo system, since on both .ogg and .amr don't work, but .mov does? If you get this/look at this before 9am, I'm users 06, 16, and 26 with submissions to the first audio assignment ( http://demo.poodll.com/mod/assign/view.php?action=grading&id=87 ). Thanks, Justin!",

First, the video is linked using Moodle's <A> method, and the default media filter converts it to a <video> tag. \n```text\n<a href=\"http://player.vimeo.com/external/VIDEO_ID.mp4?s=f586954a8dbb3f76de13aa\">My Video</a>\n```\n Insert this code in the HTML editor immediately after the video to remove the controls and begin playback: \n```text\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n\n\n  $(\"video\").prop(\"controls\", false);  // hide the controls\n\n\n  $(\"video\").get(0).play();  // play the video\n\n\n  $(\"video\").bind('contextmenu', function(e) { return false; });  // disable right-click\n```",

It goes on to say \"All of the components are already in their necessary directories and should arrive in the right place\" and that \"Moodle will set up most of the specific elements of PoodLL for you. We just have to let Moodle know we installed it. To do this, after you have copied the PoodLL modules, make sure you are logged in as admin, and click “notifications” in the site administration block. Moodle should recognize that several plugins need installing. It will recognize four new mods(filter, assignment type, question type and repository) and guide you through several install pages.\" Problem is Moodle hasn't recognised the plugins and I can't get on with the rest of the set up that follows this initial upload. Do I need to move any of the plugin folders somewhere else from the poodllall_2013022200 folder I've uploaded. Any pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks",

It is cat and mouse trying to keep up with the devices. And you simply don't have one of each to test with. So I have decided that I need to have an app, and have one in the works.

Mobile browsers (mobile safari in particular) can be quite fussy about the certificates they accept. demo.poodll.com is not using https. This would be the first thing that I would check.

If it does not play back on demo.poodll.com then it is some sort if issue with the file or how it is created.",

I have implemented a solution where each question was video recorded, ie not the whole test in one video, but one video per question. However that is not in the public domain , so I believe that I can't share it with you. Another approach would be to house the quiz in an iframe (via LTI ?) and do the video recording from outside the iframe. Then it would be a simple one video / one quiz scenario. But there would be coding involved. Justin",

We are going to be using this primarily with mobile devices (though there are plans to also use the computer lab with it as well). Currently, mobile devices upload video to the system which is completely unnescessary for us. What I'm hoping for is a demux ability in poodll that I haven't seen before. Something that strips the video bitstream out of the file and leaves me with just the audio stored on the server. Is there a setting for this that I am missing, or is it currently not possible?",

With flv, you could just remove video and the remaining audio would play (as flv). I don't know how that would work with mov files though. There is the ability to specify encoding options for ffmpeg, there on the PoodLL filter settings page, but it does assume the end format will be mp3. In my own experience the conversion to mp3 is not a significant drag on the server, but it depends on how many conversions you have going on simultaneously. Related to this, I hope to implement background encoding sometime soon, so that the user doesn't have to wait for conversions to finish.",

So it is done. Not all the options for each type are listed, but the main ones are. The URL is here: http://www.cheatography.com/justinhunt/cheat-sheets/poodll-filter/ The PDF download is attached to this forum post, but in the future you should get the latest from the url above. For those who don't know what this is all about, Poodll has a whole bunch of widgets that can be inserted into Moodle. eg a stopwatch. You do that by inserting a crafty little string that looks like this: {POODLL:type=stopwatch} which turns into stopwatch when you view the activity. The cheat sheet contains information about those crafty filter strings. You can play around, and see them, over at http://demo.poodll.com **NB DON'T COPY AND PASTE THE FILTER STRINGS** The encoding of the text on the PDF and cheatsheet website is wrong. Even without that, invisible html characters often sneak in and break things. Just type the strings out longhand. Enjoy *edited 19/06/2014 added warning about copy/paste and file encoding*",

Most of them are at the browser end of things. Did you try rebooting and using a different browser? Google Chrome has a permissions dialog that is very hard to see. It pops up when you first try to use your webcam/mike on a site. It appears just beneath the address bar in the browser. Almost everyone misses it, even I forget about it. And of course there is the standard flash permissions dialog. If permission is not granted to the camera/mic then the recording will usually fail in the way you describe. Also if Skype or another application is trying to use the webcamera, it can be unavailable for the browser. Sometimes it happens that the other app doesn't release it. Even when the other app is closed down the camera is unavailable. I wonder in these cases if there is a problem with the driver software. I sometimes get this on my mac. Anyway, rebooting and trying a different browser are good steps to take. Finally depending on the recorder you are using, try not selecting \"mp3\" or \"mp4\" on the recorder. Sometimes the conversion process is failing because the server is too busy, or the recording too long, to respond before the browser gives up waiting. Justin",

Has anyone encountered a similar issue and if so, were you able to resolve it? Thank you, Susan",

Your first link you have listed above downloads directly from Justin's site and if you get the Kaboodle, it will include all you need to get going.The second link is also ok, just have to download the different parts, one at a time. The main add-on of the bunch that all the other parts depend on is the filter. Their installation depends on the filter being installed, too. If your site folder permissions are set right and your site is registered with Moodle, an admin can actually do all the installs right in Moodle 2.5.x, by going to Administration > Site Administration > Plugins > Install add-ons then click on Install add-ons from the Moodle plugins directory.

Most people probably don't use the 2.2 assignment type anymore or the database activity field(though you can do fun stuff with it) . So if you install piecemeal from Moodle.org, you might leave those off. The one mod you must have is the PoodLL filter. Everything else uses stuff from there. Stuff generally goes up on poodll.com earlier than on Moodle.org. But at the moment everything is up to date everywhere. Just to confuse things, there is a new mod, PoodLL Anywhere. It adds recording icons to the TinyMCE editor. If you use that you probably don't need the PoodLL repository anymore either. PoodLL Anywhere can be downloaded from the page you referenced, but it is not in the Kaboodle bundle or available from Moodle.org yet. Hmm, lets summarize this a bit PoodLL Add-on On PoodLL.com In Kaboodle On Moodle.org Notes PoodLL Filter Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Question Type Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Repository Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Assignment Submission Yes Yes Yes for new Moodle assignment (avail. from Moodle 2.3) PoodLL Assignment Feedback Yes Yes Yes for new Moodle assignment (avail. from Moodle 2.3) PoodLL Assignment Type Yes Yes Yes for old Moodle assignment PoodLL Anywhere Yes No No adds PoodLL icons to TinyMCE HTML area PoodLL Database Activity Field Yes Yes Yes",

Noticed there as no overwrite messages as suggested in the Poodll docs  but Moodle upgraded my database and declared the whole thing a success, Added an assignment and sure enough there is a Poodl voice recorder and whiteboard option and I ticked the mp3 submission. The assignment does not show the recorder widget though- what have I missed? The assignment does not have any sort of recording feature available.

There are two main possibilities for this situation that are really just about learning how to use the Moodel assignment. ( I am assuming this is the new Moodle assignment (new as of Moodle 2.3). If you didn't know that there was an older version of the Moodle assignment, then you are probably ok. Since it should default to the new one.) i) did you configure PoodLL recording for the assignment submission? Or the assignment feedback? The assignment submission is what the student will do. The assignment feedback is how you respond to them. ii) Are you testing this by logging in as a student? By default a non student can't actually even do the assignment. So you have to be a student, then you will see a button saying \"add submission\" and it all starts from there. Justin",

I think many of my students usually access the net through Android phones rather than from computers and the recording looks well suited to accessing using Android. The recording app looks great but where to from here? I might try a poll of students to see how many use the same sort of outdated technology as me.",

You can tell them what to do. If they record audio regularly the nervousness and pressure fade away, but the first few times it helps to take it slowly. So I might ask them to practice their speech/introduction a few times with different partners before they record. Also if you make the thing that they record basically a no brainer, eg say some tongue twisters, sing a nursery rhyme, or read a dialog from the book. That lowers the bar too. You will possibly run into technical quicksands the first time you do it. eg The browsers are too old, or half the microphones are broken . So it pays to do the activity yourself on the student machines first, so you know what will happen for them. Not doing this still catches me out sometimes. And making the first activity obviously not important ( some tongue twisters etc) means you won't get students too frustrated if things don't go right.",

I have not heard of that specific problem, but there are a few things you might check. Does it work from a different browser? And if you are using Chrome, did you see the little popup permissions dialog that Chrome requires for webcam access?  If you didn't see it, and it is very easy to miss, that might be the problem. It shows just below the address bar of your browser. Also is the little connection lamp on the lower left of the recorder green? If not you won't be able to record until a connection to the recording server is made. Do other PoodLL feedback types work, eg mp3 recording or whiteboard? I made a lot of changes \"under the hood\" recently. So it is possible I missed something in the PoodLL Feedback mod, so please let me know how you get on.",

That would not explain why you can record as a student but not as a teacher though. If you try lowering the capture size of the video from 480x360 to something lower. Does that make a difference? If so that would indicate your connection couldn't handle as much video as mine. Also I notice a bit of flickering when the players load. You might want to check that the multimedia plugins filter is not also trying to display flv videos. If so uncheck flv on the PoodLL filter settings page, or on the multi media plugins equivalent at site administration - > appearance -> media embedding. Justin",

Before you commence recording, try checking both the device settings on the recorders settings tab, and the webcam settings on the flash properties page (right click the recorder).
