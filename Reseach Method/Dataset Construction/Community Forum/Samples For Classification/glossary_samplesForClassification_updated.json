          "Text": "Hi everyone, I recently upgraded our Moodle installation to version 5, and since then I’m encountering a fatal memory error when trying to enable or use the Glossary plugin. Here is the error message: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 805306368 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 20480 bytes) in ../cache/classes/cache.php on line 1350 This only started happening after the upgrade to Moodle 5. Before that, the Glossary plugin worked without any issues. Some details: PHP memory limit is set to 768M The error seems to occur during caching or loading of glossary entries We have a relatively large number of glossary entries, but nothing extreme Clearing the Moodle cache did not resolve the issue Has anyone experienced similar problems with the Glossary plugin after upgrading to Moodle 5? Could this be a change in how caching or memory management works in the new version? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

          "Text": "All Q: I would like to use the Glossary to search on exact terms based on the title of the CONCEPT field, NOT every time the term is mentioned in the definition field for any other entry. We have HUNDREDS of terms... when students query them - lets say they query the term \"attack\" ... EVERY ENTRY with that term will display... NOT JUST THE EXACT ENTRY FOR THAT TERM. In other words - JUST the exact entry with that exact string value as the stated in the CONCEPT FIELD for that term or phrase of the glossary, NOT EVERY ENTRY WHERE THE TERM IS MENTIONED IN THE DEFINITION OF ANOTHER TERM... The way the glossary currently works is contradictory to how humans actually use a real life glossary... in real life, they go look up the term exactly relative to what Moodle considers the CONCEPT FIELD. They don't and ask the glossary to barf out every reference to the mention of that term in the contents of EVERY ENTRY. So, I want to eliminate this design flaw by using what I think was a feature implemented to mitigate the problem, Match whole case words - from https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/Using_Glossary: \"Match whole words only If automatic linking is enabled, then turning this setting on will force only whole words to be linked. For example, a glossary entry named \"construct\" will not create a link inside the word \" constructivism \". Click Save changes to save your entry.\" Fine. Sounds like that if I check this box for the concept, the term ATTACK will NOT show up when I query anything with the term ATTACK nested in it OR any aspect of the definition, including and especially the content as listed in the definition field of other terms.",

It will link “Ice” as a concept but will not highlight that concept when the word justice is displayed. And it only highlights concepts, not content in the description. With the Glossary auto-link filter, you can choose whether to highlight the first occurrence of the concept, or every occurrence. The search functionality will search all of the glossary for occurrences of the concept word/phrase. It works more like the “index at the back” in the “how humans actually use a glossary” example you have given - ie. multiple occurrences will be shown. There is also a tick box under the (Glossary) search box which allows you to also search the full text of the entry (ie. concept and description). The alphabetical index at the top (depending on how you set the Glossary up) allows someone to browse directly to an entry (again, using your example, more of a “I know what I’m looking for”). The Global search takes things further and will search multiple contexts for the phrase, not just the glossary. So - are you talking about Global search, the Glossary search, or the auto-link functionality? The “match whole words only” tickbox will have no affect on the Global or Glossary search functionality.",

Really appreciate it 1) Its all technically \"self\" hosted, just in a different cloud 2) I will look into the behaviours of the glossary and get back to you. There are some things that I find really odd in the logic... for example, the way the query takes a full string and breaks any terms into multiple queries.... Is there any more complete documentation on the auto linking capabilities that will help me discern whats going on without bothering the forum? Thanks again!",

There are grammar rules for plural so it *may* be possible to add those to the filter so that if the concept is linked, any plural version of the concept would also be linked.

I put these direct link in various documents outside of Moodle and the problem is obvious : the ID changes when I create a new course with new enrollment. I know Moodle haven't been designed to do this but I am looking for a workaround and I have a couple ideas. 1. Is it possible to link to a glossary entry based on something else than the eid ? I think it's doable for course or activity but what about glossary entry ? I don't mind if it opens on an \"entry not found\" page. or 2. Is it possible to share a glossary between courses in the same Moodle instance ? Obviously I can create 2 course and set up the same enrollment but maybe there is a different way. or 3. Is it possible to move completely an activty (glossary) in a different course ? I know I can import or restore but that would create different eid's.",

While this can be useful, it is also useful for sort by other fields. For example, if the teacher wants to review the entries by a particular student, it would be useful to sort by author. This can be very, very helpful if the teacher has asked students to post a certain number of concepts. Alternatively, let's say that a teacher has challenged the class to define a specific concept. The teacher will then approve the \"best\" definition of the concept. Being able to sort by concept would make this much easier. (Yes, you can limit concepts by a specific letter, but even these are not in alphabetical order, they are in \"update\" or \"creation\" order.",

That is prior to approval, all potential Glossary entries are ordered by chronological date only. I'm afraid I was a bit too deep in the problem and didn't accurately nor completely describe the issue. Students are creating \"personally\" glossaries. This is accomplished by setting the Glossary to need approval and then not approving entries. This way, only the teacher and the individual student can see entries. However, this makes follow up for the teacher hard. Glossary entries can only be viewed in chronological order, not by student. Additionally, the teacher would like to approve certain exemplars for the entire class to see. Thus, viewing by Concept alpha order would be beneficial.",

For example, user Aya opens a Glossary in course Colours, and starts making their own entries for 'mauve' and 'periwinkle'. Ideally, an individual Glossary would hide these entries from other users. The workaround I've seen is to allow student submissions, require approval and then never approve them. But I don't want to have to rely on teachers+ remembering which entries not to approve, as this is bound to fail at some point. I've had a look at Databases as well, which also lack this feature. This link ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=51992 opens in new window) discusses this more. Finally, Wiki activities (or the simpler 'OU wiki') allow individual settings like I need, but both wikis require a large amount of overheard for user training. I'm trying to keep these courses as accessible as possible, and I want to include users with minimal tech experience and confidence.

I have not explicitly tested glossary links in Moodle, so cannot give a definitive answer about this. I haven't come across any issues with this so far, but it doesn't mean they don't cause issues. I would suggest testing this yourself in several ways: - a quick check to make sure you can navigate to the definition and close it again only using the keyboard. Many visually impaired and blind screen reader users will be accessing web pages using only the keyboard. - assuming you don't have access to Jaws you can test it directly using the free NVDA ( https://www.nvaccess.org/download/ ) screen reading software. - you can also use the Wave accessibility tool ( https://wave.webaim.org/ ) to see what accessibility issues it finds on the page in question. I think the browser plugin will work best with Moodle, since you will probably have to log in to gain access to the page. I hope this helps. I'd be interested to hear what you find out. If you want to post your results back on here I'm sure that would be useful for others too. Kind regards, Jess",

(Someone far more techy installed it; I sort courses' structure and content.) One of my courses had a Main-type Glossary activity (2) that I'd imported from a different course (1). I deleted this activity (2) since deleting every entry in it would take too long -- public release is coming up fast. I added a new Glossary activity (3) but it's stuck as a Secondary glossary only. Problem: Any new Glossary (4, 5 etc) is now stuck as Secondary too. Is this as expected or a bug? I hope it's just a mis-clicked setting somewhere. Attempted fixes: I thought it was from uncleared caches etc so I cleared them and ran the relevant scheduled tasks. Just in case, I then logged out, closed all tabs ( Firefox 65.0.2, 64-bit) and reopened the site on our test server. After no luck, I purged all caches (very few test users so nbd). Still nothing, and no upgrades have been pending (except v3.5.5 and 3.6.3+).",

This is outdated already, because I didn't have to go through \"Plugins\" to get to \"Filters,\" and there is no \"Manage filters\" anymore.  So I'm kind of working blind, as the directions are not up to date. I have changed the filter to \"yes,\" and have the single entry turned on for auto-linking, but it's not linking to that word in eClass.  I see no hyperlinks.  I've done two steps.  There has to be a third step.  What's the third step?",

The first instruction is for Site admins to make sure glossary autolinking is available throughout your site, so you probably didn't see it as you are only working in a course. The glossary instructions are in the documentation on Glossary activity and there is also a video you can check in the documentation page Filters However, if you feel you have done everything correctly, then one thing to try is to go back into a glossary entry and edit it - even if it's just a tiny edit, or simply open it up and then resave it. Sometimes that 'kicks in' the auto linking. I'm sorry I don't know what eClass is - but I presume it is standard Moodle.",

Were you for example using course back up, selecting only the glossary, with or without the users in the course, and then I'm lost with the disabling calendar entries. Did you mean don't put a tick in the 'include calendar event' in the backup selection process? Thank you Heather",

Can entries that were made in a course, later be imported to this glossary? Yes. The way I have been doing it is by having secondary glossaries for each unit and then pushing them to the main one. This way the students are not bombarded with a mammoth list. One thing I have not been able to figure out is how to restrict a word list and not have it show up in the main one. Currently, I am forced to do little things like this manually which is tedious work. What is the relationship between a courses main glossary and making spelling / vocabulary lists? As I understand it glossaries can be used for any number of things including the things you have mentioned. There is no reason why you could not have them all and even have them under the main glossary or separate. Do I create a separate physical glossary for each word list (spelling list) or do I just create a category? I myself am also fairly new with Moodle. So far I am not using categories but that may change. My workflow has been to create a secondary wordlist for each unit. Making the list in Libre office (calc) and then importing in bulk saves a metric ton of mouse clicks. Summary: I am teaching an English class.

          "Text": "Hello, We're in the process of building a bank of 'scenario based' learning activities for vet students, using the lesson activity to enable our students to practice clinical decision making and professional judgement. Rather than displaying a long list of links to the cases (initially 8 but will grow), I thought a good way to present this supplementary content would be to add a link to each case in a glossary, then present this as a 'case of the week' using the random glossary entry sideblock. This seems to work perfectly, but I'm concerned about how it might work in future versions of Moodle. We're about to upgrade to 3.3, and it looks as though Moodle have taken a decision to phase out the use of sideblocks to be more mobile device friendly - for a start, the new mobile moodle app doesn't display sideblocks even if they are present in a course. If Moodle does do away with sideblock functionality completely I'm sure we'll cope - it just means having to redesign all of our courses so that they don't rely on information presented in blocks. I'm concerned that this \"feature\" needs a clear exit strategy to give us time to adapt - eg \"sideblocks will be discontinued in Moodle 3.5, prior to that the mobile app will still display sideblocks\", and guidance on which tools can provide equivalent functionality - or will we have the option to add (or move) existing sideblocks to the main screen? Apologies for this becoming a bit of a rant - my actual question was Can anyone suggest an alternative to sideblocks as a way of serving up the case scenarios, either randomly or sequentially in a way that doesn't clutter up the page? I'm anticipating we will have 30 scenarios by next year so don't want to simply list all of them. One reason for wanting to randomise is that real-life vets can't predict which cases they'll have to deal with on any given day. Regards, Gordon.",

I tried to solve the problem with a Glossary - I made an entry named one of my custom profile field names, and linked it.

          "Text": "Hi all, we’d like to organize a hieracal „glossary“ – structure. By\ndefault it is possible to have a standard glossary „connected“ to a main\nglossary in the same course. By „connected “ I mean the possiblity to export an\nitem inside the standard glossary manually by klicking on a plus sign to the\nmain glossary.  Is it possible to export\nan item that way from a standard glossary in a course to a main glossary on a\nhigher level (e.g. start page)? Basicly we want to let the students fill a glossary inside a\ncourse. By default each new item is invisible. It should become visible after\nour approval. If an item is useful for a wider audience we’d like to\nexport it/(better map it on the fly by a klick)  to a global or main  glossary on a higher level preferably on the\nstartpage in order to let each user share it. At the moment I’m reading the forums ... would cool if can\nget me started here ... ideas? Experiences ? Another approach I thought of is to  put one central glossary on the start page\nand set a link to it in courses.  This is\nnot exactly what I want. I’d like to have specialized glossaries that\ncorresponds to particular topics inside a course. However , if  I’m forced to do so, is it maybe possible to\ndefine particular views of the main glossary. Maybe it is possible to call a\ncertain category by a url parameter. ... Looking forward to your answers! Best, Sonja",

          "Text": "Hello all - I am creating a course in Moodle 2.6.10 that contains a glossary. I have auto-linking enabled, and glossary terms are appearing as links which, when clicked, open the definition in a pop-up. The pop-up is causing a problem as far as 508 accessibility goes - when testing the course with a screen reader, the screen reader proceeds to read the popup definition, but then does not go back to the next word after the glossary term, it jumps to the page footer instead. I think a better solution might be to disable the popup and just have the link direct to the glossary page. Then the user could just go back to the page where the term appeared.  But I have been unable to figure out how to do this. Can anyone help/advise on either how to disable the glossary popups, or have a better solution?  Thank you!",

Is it possible to restrict the browsing by author so that they would be able to see ONLY their own glossary entries? If not, then is it possible to only PRINT just their own entries.? My goal is to have students print a vocabulary study guide that they themselves created. This will allow students to, in a sense, create vocabulary and/or other types of study notes that belong only to them, and if needed, to share their notes with other students who have other notes. In that way, the entire class can collaborate, but they can also have their own private notes. I thought of using the database , but its print function is poor, only being able to export as Excel or ODS files. The glossary print function is much more robust. Thanks.",

In my \"waiting for approval\" screen, there is a drop down menu to rate the entry, but when selected it throws the error \"Rating of items not allowed!\" I think it is good to have the rating there on the approval screen because it would save a lot of time.  Unfortunately it doesn't work for me on the approval screen which means I have to approve, then go find the entry to rate it. Anyone else have this problem and would like this feature to work? Otherwise, why have the rating drop-down menu there if we can rate it there?",

Did it work for you? See this discussion . Unfortunately in Moodle 2 autolinking no longer works in uploaded HTML files. This bug completely ruined my Moodle courses, which were based on uploaded HTML files containing lots of words needing autolinking to the course glossary. Fortunately (for me), this happened just when my university switched to Moodle 2 and at the time I retired from my teaching job! However, I am surprised there have not been more protests at this regression since Moodle 2 has gradually superseded previous versions. Reported as bug MDL-37830 for which you may vote. Joseph",

The Search function in glossary does return any results for an entry consisting of only one character , whatever that character is.

I will enquire some more and open an issue in the bug tracker. Joseph",

We tried the \"groupings\" as mentioned in here, but (1) I can't find any site administration level settings when I do a keyword search with keyword \"groupings\" (only came up with \"Version 1 import\" which I don't even know what that is). So I'm assuming that the \"groupings\" should be enabled by default in Moodle 2.4.6. Now, if this is enabled, I wonder why there is no such setting at the Glossary level for me to choose \"Groupings.\" I do have groupings set up at the course level, but couldn't find related setting in the Glossary level.

          "Text": "I have recently migrated some tutorials to Moodle. In their former location they had a facility where the user could add URLs of referenced sites that they liked to a 'links basket' which they could then export at the end of the tutorial to add to their bookmarks or a file of links.  An experienced Moodle user suggested that I use a glossary to replicate this functionality in Moodle. I set up a glossary with the export feature enabled and added links to the relevant part of the glossary (anchored by initial letter of the glossary entry) from the main part of the tutorial.  It would have been nice if the 'autolinking' to the glossary could have been used here, but it didn't work because it just popped up an isolated definition without the chance to export the glossary entry.  Linking manually to the glossary as I've done is a reasonable substitute, though if you look at the tutorial on a laptop you tend to see only the header part of the glossary page rather than the entry! I have the impression that some at least of the functionality I've used is fairly new in Moodle (because it doesn't appear in older documentation).  So may I suggest the following ideas for future releases? a) a bit more flexibility in autolinking (e.g. optionally allowing you to export the glossary link, or taking you to a page of the glossary rather than a popup). b) a rather shorter header on glossary pages for glossary entries beginning with a particular letter.",

          "Text": "Dear moodlers, we are currently discussing how to use glossaries across a number of courses. One way is to create a metacourse which includes the glossary, and having several child courses with students. 1. Autolink does not work from the metacourse glossary entries to the child course text. How do students know that the phrase is in the glossary? 2. In order to enter the glossary, students will have to switch from the child course to the relevant metacourse. Isn´t that confusing for students? 3. The platform wide glossary is no solution, as we have several countries and this way languages on the first level of course navigation, and in addition to that I (= admin) am not responsible for course content. Is it possible to have several glossaries defined in the context of a course category (e.g. = country)? Do you have any better solution to share one glossary across several courses? Best regards, Marcus",

For several reasons we today have most of the content in html learning objects created by an authoring tool (EasyProf which supports nice interactive features). The LOs are attached to the moodle courses via static links. This gives us the option to link one resource to several courses (single resource), and to produce offline learning CD ROMs for those who have no access to our intranet. The downside of this is that we can´t use autolink. But for us today, copying resources to several courses is the bigger pain (\"version chaos\"). It would be nice to use glossaries on context levels, just like question buffers. Than, in our structure, we would have one glossary for one course category (e.g. country). Best Regards, Marcus",

The only thing that is not working are the links to images that I've included and the automatic linking of glossary terms. I'm going to work on a solution to this. The ability to share a glossary is crucial as I'm using Moodle to teach music lessons. Each course is going to change to fit that particular student, but I want the same glossary to be shared throughout all of the courses in one particular area of study. If I have 50 vocal students each with their own unique course, I would like the glossary immediately available at the top of their course and shared between all of them.

The only options for how to display items was (random / last modified entry / next item)  which meant that if items needed to be presented in a specific order that had to be the order they were first uploaded into the glossary.  This is necessary if you plan on putting 2 glossaries in sync (puzzle today and yesterday's solution). At the time (2009) I was told that Moodle 2.0 would allow for that type of presentation (alphabetical).  QUESTION: Does Moodle 2.x do that?  My school's version doesn't but that could be (most probably is) because the admin hasn't checked something or downloaded something that is in Moodle 2.x.

I see that one way to get around this is to make each of my topics a separate \"course.\"  But conceptually, they aren't really courses, they're just part of one course. So what I'm wondering is how to do one of the following? 1) Put a glossary inside of a topic instead of making it it's own. or 2) Customize the numbering so that, for example, the glossary can be \"topic 2a\" and then the next topic would be \"topic 2b\" so that the one after that comes out as topic \"3\" instead of being \"4.\" PS - If I go ahead and make my topics into separate \"courses\" but use the automatic linking feature in the glossary, presumably that won't work, right?  ... As I would expect that the glossary's automatic linking of terms would only work within the course....",

Here's an example of such a definition wiki: http://demo.moodle.net/mod/wiki/view.php?id=570 (in Dutch but hopefully you get the idea!)",

My current version seems incapable of doing this.  I can paste arabic script into the definitions box during the \"edit\" phase, but the script is displayed as a series of \"?\" after finishing the editing.  I tried different formats: moodle auto format, html, plain text, and markdown format.  Nothing works! First, I would like to know if I can have a glossary that mixes languages in the definition portion.  If so, how would I do this?  Second, I can see that incorporating different script into glossaries seems reoccur regularly.  Is there any documentation that discusses this issue?

While the glossary contains only text (and no attachments or embedded media) I can export it as XML and do bulk edits in the XML but as soon as I attach files it appears that I can't edit the glossary outside of Moodle. Does anyone know of a way that I can edit the glossary in an XML format and still maintan the links to the attached files or embedded media?  Thus far I have tried editing the BACKUP file and then using RESTORE but the results have not been sucessful. The background is that the glossary is based on the excellent Moodle FAQ from the University of Bath at http://moodle.bath.ac.uk/faq/ They have made it available to others as an Open Educational Resource http://andyramsden.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/oer-faq-database/ Thus far I have massaged their XML file to get it into a format that the Moodle glossary will read. Editing the XML is useful as bulk changes can be made throughout the file but it appears that as soon as we attach files to the glossary entries or embeded media we are forced to edit the files only in the Moodle Glossary interface. We will be talking about our progress at the upcoming Australian MoodleMoot. http://moodlemoot.org.au/ Peter Evans Moodle support at ANU",

Another problem I've noticed is that when only the first instance of a concept is linked, other instances further down the page, such as headings, which you might like to link, cannot be linked. It's either every instance or only the first instance so far. I wonder if it would be possible to have, someday, a force autolinking button to go with the prevent autolinking button, so that additional instances could be linked if desired. A possible workaround in the meantime would be to disable the link only first instance filter and use the prevent auto linking button to suppress instances you don't want linked. I assume whole sections of text can be prevented from linking in one fell swoop. Not elegant, but probably feasible.",

At the moment I have setup a dictionary using glossary and then when I add each new word, in the KEYWORDS section I add a translation in Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese. Now when I search a word, I can search by any language. THe problem though is that all languages show up at the same time (no button to select the language I want) and English is ALWAYS the main language. I'd like Chinese learners, for example, to be able to access the dictionary in Chinese and then get an English translation of the word. I could set up an excel file in each language and then import into 3 or 4 different glossaries. The students could then select which glossary they would like to access. It would be nice though if I could link all of the glossaries together. Any suggestions? thanks Steve",

It offers the powerful feature to automatically generate autolinks to the entries in many of the various resources and activities on a moodle course. If you need to retain the autolink feature, then you would need to enter your \"dictionary\" into a glossary. But... buidling a glossary or dictionary is a tough task, it is really a job for professional lexicographers. On top of that you want your glossary to be multilingual, which will stretch things even further. If, on the other hand, you do not need the autolink feature and all you want is to provide your students with an online multilingual dictionary, the simplest solution is to provide in your courses a link (or links) to one or more online dictionaries - there are plenty available, in all the languages you need.

You cannot just import the Moodle Glossary activity into a non-Moodle website, because that activity requires the Moodle API. You can only export a Moodle Glossary's data and re-import that data into a database of some sort which is available on your other website and link that database to some PHP (or Java or Javascript ) script which will retrieve the data and display it on your website.

I can go into any course (within any Catagory) and see the Global Glossary words highlighted in grey. So far so good, but here's the problem: When I click on a grey highlighted link it opens a window but doesn't desplay the glossary term. Instead it shows in the 'Link-chain' (I don't know the actual term but it is the link bar below the header of the page showing how I got from the front page to the current page) that it is trying to search glossary terms for the course I'm in. Which there are none because the Global Glossary is on the Front Page. Ex of 'link-chain': frontpage->coursecategory->search I checked the source on one of the links and this is what it showed: <a class=\"glossary autolink glossaryid4\" title=\"Masters Program Glossary: Blood\" href=\" http://mysite.com/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=7&amp;concept=Blood \" Xonclick=\"return openpopup('/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=7\\&amp;concept=Blood', 'entry', 'menubar=0,location=0,scrollbars,resizable,width=600,height=450', 0);\">Blood</a> I think to find the Global Glossary listings it needs to search the front page.

          "Text": "Hi all, I have a small development project about to get underway regarding glossary and am wondering if people would want this feature in core Moodle (2.0 or 2.1) so I thought I'd post here to see. Basically the idea is, a global glossary search for teachers which they can use to find definitions in other courses on the site, that might be relevant to their own course (ie so they can copy/paste it). The intention is, let's say you are working on a science course and you are about to write a glossary definition for 'photosynthesis', then you think, hang on, we've done loads of other courses, I bet somebody already wrote one. So you search across the whole site or across the Science category, you find one, you copy it, then just add a new glossary entry as usual, paste it in, and maybe tweak it a bit to be more relevant to your course. So there would be a link from the glossary to a 'search across glossaries' page. You would then be able to choose to search all glossaries across all courses in (a) the current category, or (b) any parent category, or (c) the whole site. The search would just be on the glossary term (wildcards permitted, so you could search for 'photosy*' if you're lazy or if you think other teachers probably misspelt it), and not a full text search. Results would be shown as normal paged results 10 at a time or whatever, you could click on them to go to the glossary entry or just copy/paste it straight from the page if desired. There might be a button you could click next to a glossary entry to add it to your own glossary, this would just open up the glossary add form, with the text from the existing entry filled in, so you could edit it and hit save. I haven't figured out quite how permissions should work, but presumably it would only include results from glossaries you are allowed to actually see. The link itself would appear to anyone who's allowed to add entries in the current glossary. I can code this thing locally just for us, but if there is an interest in having this in Moodle 2 core (and if I can agree it with Martin etc) then it would be nice to add it to that. Seems to me it might be useful to other sites.",

That is the glossary in the second topic, you should do automatic link in the words that are inside this topic 2. 2. Sign the word \" flame \" in the glossary. In my course have a sentence like this: Paul is called Paulinho. And he created the link but in fact the word has nothing to do. Want to know how to make it not happen. And you have to do this.

Each entry a student makes in the Glossary is worth 2 points, up to a maximum of 30 extra credit points for the course/Glossary. The problem we're having is with the grading of the Glossary entries. What the instructor would like is to provide the students 2 points on the rating scale for each of the entries they have added and then have all of those entries totaled in the Grade Book. Unfortunately what happens is that after the instructor rates the first entry (2/30), the student's grade stays at 2/30 regardless of how many additional entries are added and rated by the instructor. This Glossary is a semester-long activity, so having the Glossary as a non-gradeable activity and adding a manual grade book item to total the extra credit points isn't an option - the instructor wants the points totaled automatically within the grade book. Does anyone know of a workaround (other than a manual grade book item) to get a Glossary to be graded similar to a Forum's \"Sum of Ratings\" Aggregation type?",

Please search these forums for \"max file size\", and you will find tons of discussions, mostly in the General problems forum. For instance that discussion . You might consider re-posting your question to the General problems forum for help. Be aware that some providers limit that upload max size to e.g. 8 MB, especially if you are on a free or cheap provider. ATB Joseph",

I managed to add this functionality to the glossary and I am curious if anyone else is interested enough for me to clean it up and contribute it back to the module? I simply added a field for selecting a language pack and modified the alphabet function to use the alphabet string from the selected language pack. I am also having some unicode problems along the way with the section headings that are printed in alphabet mode. Variants of Greek vowels with differing breathing marks are not being recognized as the same letter. It works fine with letters that have modifiers, since the first \"character\" is the same. However, using modifiers for diacriticals does not display well in Firefox for capital letters, so I am using pre-composed letters such as Ἰ.

Would it be possible for the teacher to make changes and/or comments to entries but the entry remaining hidden until approved?? I'm afraid the answer is 'no'. That's why I thought of a possible solution to this handicap. Maybe it would be useful if the same parameter existing in databases which works like 'x' entries required before seeing the entries already published was also present in glossaries. Just thinking out loud, but could this possibility be taken into account in future versions of Moodle?",

I strongly advise against doing this. Pasting text from Word into the HTML editor is prone to all kind of formatting problems!

When you run the macro it has three checkboxes for you to tick and it will populate columns c-f with 1's or 0's. Use dyna link - (dynamic linking) is the setting that allows the definition to be linked to from other moodle activitie. Setting this to 1 means that wherever that definition appears in your course it will have a link to the glossary entry. (For example see the term HTH in this message) Case sensitive - whether or not the matched word has to have the same case structure as given in the definition inorder for linking to work. Full match - does the definition have to be on its own or can it be part of a larger word, eg definition is \"Start\" should it match with \"Starter\" or not. Category - in the glossary you can have categories, there can be only one category per definition for this spreadsheet. HTH Dave",

So the word \"개관\" ( (outline - for the curious) does not appear in its correct placement under the first letter \"ㄱ\" but in a newly created division \"개\". Of course, it does not even register in the English alphabet index of the english users glossary. It just shows up in a list format categorized under \"개\". In other words, it seems that moodle (i am running 1.7) glossary is not indexing korean characters correctly. Above that, the use of two languages is confusing it even more - specially at the user interface level: where would the word \"개관\" be indexed using latin characters?

          "Text": "Hi everybody! In a glossary, it is possible to display a selection of articles belonging to a category; or in alphabetic order by selecting all articles beginning by one letter; or using the Search or Search full text facility. Then, from the display screen, one can click on the Printer icon to print the selected articles. One would expect the same to be true for the Export entries facility. Unfortunately, whichever selected articles are displayed on the Glossary page, Export entries will always export ALL entries from the current Glossary! I am attaching PATCH files against current version 1.8.3 for mod/glossary export.php, exportfile.php, lib.php and view.php . These patches enable the user to do all kind of selection of articles and to export to file only those articles which have been selected and are displayed. It goes even further than the Print facility, as articles selected and displayed through either the Search or Search full text facility can be exported to file. This new facility can be tested on my moodle test site: http://rezeau.info/moodle . Log in as teacher1 , password teacher1 , go to the Questionnaire module Demo course and experiment with My Test Glossary . If there is enough interest in this little hack I hope the Glossary maintainer will accept to commit it to current Glossary files in moodle regular distribution. Please vote for MDL-12653 . Joseph PS- Attached zip file contains both complete hacked files and patches. Please use with care, on a test site and report any problems here.",

The range of entries among the 12-20 books we'll eventually put online varies a lot. Some are \"selected glossaries\" of only a page or two while others run to many dozens of pages. I'm specifically wondering whether it would make most sense to do each book's glossary as a secondary, or to make a monster primary glossary using the books as the categories. The only factor I've been able to come up with so far is the (frankly far-off) possibility that online courses may be built around the texts, and in that case we'd want a stand-alone glossary. So I guess I'm leaning that way, but wondering what I might be missing by not going the category route. Ideas? Thanks in advance for helping me think it through.",

This of course limits the usefulness of the block as a sticky block / especially as a sticky block on a MyMoodle page outside of any course. Two possible solutions: I could give you an ugly hack which allows every teacher to choose every glossary in every course, BUT then the links at the bottom of the blocks will no longer work (because they point to a specific course). Tell me if that's ok. I am working at writing a similar block which displays random entries from a database activity. That one allows teachers to reuse database activities from all courses. There is however still a problem with images: because they are stored inside the files area of a specific course, only students from that particular course have access to them. I really don't know how to solve that issue.",

          "Text": "We are using Moodle 1.6.4+. Many of our departments have used 'courses' as repositories of information i.e. worksheets, course details, assignment sheets etc. resulting in 'courses' containing huge list of semi-organised, difficult to search for content. In many cases it was necessary to know where the content was before you could search for it. These 'courses' were not for student consumption but for tutor reference purposes. After completing an exercise to create a searchable glossary of the NLN material (UK based ' SCORM ' content), I began to realise the potential of glossaries and started to suggest that tutors use glossaries to create searchable 'repositories'. A number of tutors then contacted me, passed me the information and asked me to create glossaries, using the excellent spreadsheet supplied by David Fountain . At this point I should note that I am aware of the database module but I seem to have some sort of mental block when creating tables as I cannot visualise their appearance from the set up page. It has now become obvious to me that creating glossaries for this type of resource is useless without attaching or linking to the 'document' that is the subject of the glossary entry. Using the view source option in browsers I have been able to recover the 'addresses' of the resources but cannot find a way to use this information - my knowledge is sadly lacking, it comes from being self-taught - and not too well at that. So far I am only able to create these links manually and it is 'mind-numbingly' tedious and prone to errors. Is there to anyone's knowledge a way of automating this process? Although I have been an administrator for over a year, what I know about php, xml , macros and scripting would fit on the head of a pin, so please be gentle. ian",

But in the short term, it sounds like the situation is this: - You have content sitting as resources inside the courses - You have one or more glossaries which act as the gateway to those resources. I don't know a way of automating the resource collection. I'm sure it can be done, by reading the course's XML file (in the backup) and creating a glossary from it. But, like you, this is beyond my current abilities (and time to learn). The quickest (and safest) manual way of getting the resource's URL (address) is by right-clicking on the link to it in the course, and copying that into the \"insert link\" dialogue box in the glossary entry. It's easier than trying to find the URL using view source. Or have I misunderstood what you're trying to do? Cheers, Mark",

Create your own glossary, make a note of all the various choices you make for the parameters. Then create one or two categories, create half a dozen entries, trying each time to change the parameters offered. Finally, export your glossary and look at the generated XML file. You can easily deduct from your choice of parameters the value that is required for each field. Also, the schema I posted will help you understand what kind of value is required (numerical, text) and whether the fields are required or optional, etc. But you really have to familiarize yourself with the workings of the Moodle glossary first of all. Joseph Example Glossary editing XML file Students can add entries: <xsd:element name=\"STUDENTCANPOST\" type=\"xsd:int\" /> Duplicated entries allowed: <xsd:element name=\"ALLOWDUPLICATEDENTRIES\" type=\"xsd:int\" /> for each entry <xsd:element maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" name=\"ENTRY\"> Concept: <xsd:element name=\"CONCEPT\" type=\"xsd:string\" /> Definition: <xsd:element name=\"DEFINITION\" type=\"xsd:string\" /> This entry should be automatically linked (tick box = 1; not ticked = 0) <xsd:element name=\"USEDYNALINK\" type=\"xsd:int\" /> etc.",

Is there a difference in encoding between the two systems? 1.6 supports UTF-8 databases. If there is an encoding problem then you could try unzipping the backup, converting the ecoding of the XML inside and rezipping. How about creating a test 1.5 moodle with the glossary and upgrading that installation to moodle 1.6. The upgrade routine may do more checks than the backups. I know that the upgrade has in the past sometimes checked for known database issues. If the worst came to the worst, there is probably a way of reformatting the database XML (again inside the backup zip) into a blackboard style glossary and importing it as a flat file, somewhere on the forums. But you would loose keywords and other information. Tim",

Previous categories I had prior to updgrading are OK - new ones go in without spaces etc. as per above - if you insert the spaces in the categories directly in the database it holds the changes but also keeps the entry without spaces?. Work around for me, is to add new categories and fix them in the database (deleting extra entries in the glossary and database when required). Regards H",

          "Text": "I was wondering if anyone has any ideas about how to use the Browse by Alphabet when it doesn't make sense--for example, with an FAQ, all of the entries begin with I (I need to....) or H (How do I....). This looks rather silly and doesn't add any value to the glossary. There is no option to get rid of the Browse by Alphabet tab (although I could comment it out in tabs.html). Here's what I was thinking for a workaround. Add a keyword to the begining of the entry so it is picked up by the first letter in the keyword (e.g. Stress--How do I... gets sorted under S instead of H). Then change the word Alphabet to Keyword for the tab. But, I was wondering if it would be possible to define an alphabet for that glossary with keywords instead of letters. That way, the category header for the alphabet would show keywords instead of letters, so S would be shown as Stress. (And show alphabet could be set to no so it wouldn't be too cumbersome) It seems like having the ability to define an alphabet for a glossary (rather than a site-wide alphabet) might come in handy for other reasons too.",

Selected items can then be easily exported to a separate \"approved\" list. The glossary category, comments and display options appear to make it more suited to this purpose than a forum.

I\nbelieve the the problem is that there are too many simultaneous\nconnections to the database . The hosting company told me that there is\na limit of 10 simultaneous connections, that this was plenty, and that\nit could not be increased. It has just occurred to me that the\ncause of this problem may be that the auto-linking function of the\nglossary is causing too many connections to the database. Is this\npossible? In both my online courses there are student created\nglossaries. The idea is that as English language students they add\n'difficult' words and phrases they come across in the online course\nmaterial. This has been very successful; after a month of classes there\nare already 700 or so entries in each glossary. All these entries are\nautomatically linked.

In other words, how do you design the link to appear on your site? Or, does it make a difference to you?

I am using ADSL. My textbook has about 600 terms in the glossary I would like to upload . Short glossaries are okay for content teachers but for language teachers longer ones are needed. So, as a solution, is it possible to autolink the glossary * only to certain pages *, e.g. Solution A) page with a tag in them saying \"autolink to this page\" (Ideallly) Solution B) pages of a certain type e.g. resource pages. Either of these would kill two birds with one stone. If users were aware that they are opening a page with a special, wonderful, auto linked feature then they would be prepared to wait.

It seems that I read somewhere that I could insert a \"<nolink>cli</nolink>ck\" tag and that item would not be linked. However, that doesn't seem to work. When I insert the code into the WYSIWYG editor it just shows up in the final page as written. When I open the HTML view and insert the code, it gets changed to an XHTML empty element: \"<nolink />cli</nolink />ck\" and does not turn off the automatic link.

A cache is a collection of duplicate data, where the original data is expensive to fetch or  compute (usually in terms of access time) relative to the cache. Future accesses to the data can be made by accessing the cached copy rather than refetching or recomputing the original data, so that the perceived average access time is lower. Caches may mark the cached data as 'stale' when the original data is changed, but this is not always the case. The reason caches work at all is that many access patterns in typical computer applications have locality of reference. There are several sorts of locality, but we mainly mean that often the same data is accessed frequently or with accesses that are close together in time, or that data near to each other are accessed close together in time.

We have set up a Main Glossary with the Automatically Link Glossary Entries option set to Yes. The Display Format is simple, dictionary style, and the options Show 'Special' Link , Show Alphabet and Show 'All' Link , are all set to Yes. We have chosen not to allow ratings. We have created two entries so far and the text within the course that matches these entires is highlighted by a grey box. When you are within the course and click on the highlighted text a small window opens but does not show the glossary entry for that word. Also when you go directly to the glossary it does show all entries but when you try to browse alphabetically, for example looking under A , it shows no entries even though the word annotate has been added to the glossary by a teacher and even though when we set up the glossary we slected yes for Show Alphabet . Can anyone suggest what we may be doing wrong or if perhaps there is a setting in Moodle's overall administration that may need tweaking by our technician. Many thanks and kind regards Sue",

I agree that ideally the data in the glossary should ideally be maximised in this way. Export files from the glossary might be imported to the lesson module, or the test module, or both, possibly using the GIFT format (perhaps that is not necessary). So getting the modules to speak to each other more, rather than extending the glossary itself in that direction seems more Zen. Please try the lesson modules flashcard fucntionality. There are two types of Flashcard setting. Please let Ray know on the Lesson Module forum , which (or both) is the better type. I confess I have not tried it yet. Sorry Ray! today...today...he says.

Since links that contain the glossary title will probaly be quite common, perhaps adresses/links not have auto insertion.

I get this: \"Course Module ID was incorrect\" if I click on a category name outside my main page, say, within another course. I can work around this for a while by fooling the category linking system and naming my Categories in all upper case letters; i.e., FRUIT instead of Fruit or fruit.
