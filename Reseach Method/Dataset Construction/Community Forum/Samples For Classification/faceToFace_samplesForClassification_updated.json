          "Text": "Hi @Dan, We've recently noticed that for workshop registrations, the format of the listings for those currently enrolled in a listed workshop has changed from the order in which registrations are received, to A-Z listings based on first name when viewing as admin user. As the formatting has changed to A-Z, it's now unclear whether the waitlist function would still be able to track next-in-line if someone registered cancels their registration. Therefore, if a workshop becomes full and several individuals are waitlisted, is the first waitlisted person still offered a position first? Does the waitlist function recognise a time-stamp of when people register to manage this, or is this new A-Z listing structure likely to impact the waitlist function for students? We look forward to your advice.",

I have recently joined a new business who uses moodle as their LMS, they currently don't use face to face plugin (we require our service provider to update moodle version), at the moment F2F training is kept on a spreadsheet and separate etc. I am trying to show them the benefits of adopting the F2F plugin and how it will a more automated system and move away from manual tasks (calendars, emails etc). Does anyone have a video they can share of the F2F in action - planned calendar, booking people on, emails sent and taking attendance. I hope someone will be able to help me with this. Thanks",

If someone wants to re-register for a future session, they would have to be marked as \"No-show\" for the session that they registered before. However, we have very large population of participants and very few people to actually watch the attendance. It would be hard to compare each person and mark people who didn't show up as no-show.  Is there a way to just open up the registration list to allow multiple signing up? Thanks!!",

I found nothing that has the functionality of f2f...attendance might be more what you're looking for...but I think it tracks more of a day to day thing and, again, requires marking. At my prior job, we customized f2f to add an attendance by id option. We all had magnetic strip ID badges that had our id numbers coded in, so we could connect a usb swiper (or use a keyboard with a swiper) and as people walked in, they could swipe for attendance. Or the teacher could type in their ID's manually. Or could copy the list of swipes and paste it in for additional sessions (we frequently had back to back classes and people were required to attend several on the same day). It was pretty slick. The guy who wrote the code said it wasn't too hard. But that was a code hack and I can't share it...I don't work there any longer and they a) stopped using moodle and b) were resistant to sharing (I don't know why, the director was like that. Didn't like Moodle or open source, liked secret squirrel, now he's paying over $50,000 a year for something that doesn't have the flexibility Moodle has).",

We will be offering computer training classes on this platform. Most of the students will have access via LDAP or OAuth, but there will be times when we have some warehouse folks taking courses as well, and most of them do not have either of those login options. (We were, of course, not informed of this until way into the process of setting up the server and the software, go figure). We were also told late in the game that some warehouse managers might want to bulk enroll their employees. The biggest issue is that (as near as I can tell), Moodle requires each student to have an email address. While I completely understand the need for that, it really limits our options for solving the problem. HR won't let them use personal emails. I'd just have them all register under their manager's email address, but I'm pretty sure Moodle doesn't allow that, either. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",

So if course completion is tied to activity completion that will still mark as complete despite the no show. In some plugins there is an option to restriction completion to a passing grade, but F2F doesn't support that. So in this use case I would set the required course grade to 75 or 100 for course completion rather than rely on activity completion, or if there are other activities I would use a grade restriction instead of an activity completion to restrict access to the later activities.

We are switching over to Moodle and have data from or old system which has the structure of multiple Classes within a course, the equivalent to multiple Sessions in a Topic in Moodle. Moving forward in Moodle, the structure we have set is: 1. within a course there are multiple topics (doing different things), 2. in one of the Topics of a Course there are multiple Face to Face activities (1 for each state  the course is presented in 3. In each fact to Face activity there are multiple sessions which are run in each State We want to be able to import all the historical classes into the session within each state activity of face to face. We have tried it, and each imported class becomes its own course with blank topics in them. this then makes it hard as there becomes so many courses, and a mess. some of these courses prerequisites for future course, and instead of just making the prerequisite for 1 course, we will have to create it for every course (Too many) Please Help, I am a novice at this and the person which was assisting (which was more experienced) is no longer working for our company.",

His description of the issue: There is an issue\nwith the Name and Introduction text fields. It seems like we only get ‘one\nshot’ at defining these.  If I want to make any changes to either the Name or Introduction text subsequent to creating and 'save and display'– these are not being\nsaved. The consequence is that we cannot make any changes to these\ntwo fields (quite important ones) in a F2F once it’s published…It means\ncreating new ones all the time. Also, even after duplicating an existing F2F\n(to save some time), it’s only changes in the “first” edit that are being\nsaved. Any subsequent edits do not display. Does anyone know of a solution to this problem? Thank you Ruthine",

I have a face to face session integrated in this course.  I created groups because I have a few face to face sessions in the morning and in the afternoon. I put conditional access to the morning or the afternoon sessions depending on group affiliation (group A or group B). It would be so practical if one can add a cohort or a group directly to a face to face. So far this is done manually. which is a pain because i have to upload users, enrol them in their cohort, add them to their groups. But I have also to add them to the face to face manually.

This results in the user being added to the course but with no role . The user then has no ability to participate in activities . Users who were previously enrolled into the course have the student role as expected. When added to the session they retain the student role and can participate in all activities. Is this normal behaviour for Face-to Face? OR is there a way to add users to a session (F2F) so that they are given the student role ?",

Example: I have as many as 5000 users at any given time (far more accounts at this point) and a few hundred classroom events (topics) going on each year.  Those users are eligible (mandated!) to attend specific topics in specific locations.  Each topic has a F2F section with all the available sessions people can sign up for...If we teach Sexual Harassment (don't do it) 10 times, and there are 250 staff who can sign up for the class, I create one activity with 10 sessions, each, in theory, accommodating 25 people.

          "Text": "Hi all, As you may be aware this plugin is sometimes supported and sometimes not. There are a few reasons for this and I am trying to rectify some of those as I go through things and sorry for the delays. One problem that the community of users can help me with is the way in which issues are being reported. At the moment there are many different threads being opened - here, in the plugin directory feedback, github, private messages to me etc - sometimes reporting the same issue or something that might be resolved within a different version. This means that it is difficult to track the exact issues and clearly identify where and when things should be corrected and to let the community know of updated code. I have switched off bug reporting on the github directory itself in the hopes that the Moodle tracker itself becomes the only place for issues to be reported. I'd like to also build a roadmap for coming versions and feature improvements so having all the issues in one place will really help this plan moving forward. There have been, since I took over maintenance, a few things I'd like to add and alter but first I need to get the current code into a consistent state. If you experience a issue please first check the tracker to see if there is an item already reporting this which you can add to and/or vote on and if not then please create a new one. The forums and plugin comments should ideally be used only for questions regarding general support such as configuration questions, suggestions for features and their related discussions and general use or feedback of the module. I will not be able to support bugs reported in these locations. In the meantime, thank you for your patience, Stacey",

Sometimes, no invitations are sent out, even though I have received a confirmation. Other times it sends some invitations out but not all of them.

Or for the course completion to work properly with the prerequisities would they have to sign up for each session? Sorry if that is really confusing...

You can test this by setting up more than one session for a face to face and see if the same student can sign up to multiple sessions. To accomplish this in our setting we have to set up separate face to face activities , each with its own sessions. Your bigger problem might be that F2F counts any attendance status (Fully attended, partially attended, no show) as being a valid completion. This is also a problem for us but I have not had time to look into the solution that the followup message to this thread offers: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=225026",

My other answer to the above is - I have remmed out the lines that have partially attended or no show - if someone doesn't show, the facilitator actually removes them from the session. This way, they have to get a \"Attended\" to get a course completion. Obviously this may not work for everyone. Incidently, I have a cancellation report, which picks out students that have cancelled sessions and why, and when the person cancelling the session is not the student, puts it as a \"No Show\" Cheers Peter",

We are working on a custom addition to Face to Face that adds another layer of approval after the manager approval so that an account number can be entered by a fund manager. In addition, the approval links that take the approvers to their approvals filter the approvals on the page so that only their own approvals show, AND the approver does not need the permission to the entire Attendees page if they use the link to access the approvals page. I hope that we can eventually get this code and some other code we are customizing in F2F incorporated into the main F2F module. Will tell more as it develops in case others are interested.",

Please contact the site administrator. ! Of course I am the administrator, but I couldn't find the answer in the documentation. The FAQ says \"Starting with the Moodle 1.9 version of the Face-to-face module, a custom field called \"Manager's email\" is added to the user profile page\". But I don't see it in the user profile (I mean the one under site administration). Furthermore, adding the address to each student manually seems very cumbersome! So I guess there should be another way: is there a step-by-step guide? The only place to insert an email seems to be in the module settings \"sender address\", (as the sender should be the manger, I guess), but it doesn't work. There is a section \"Manager emails\" on the same page, but I couldn't understand those settings, particularly \"Ask users for their manager's email address.\" confused me. Should the student set their own manager's address? Could I be driven to some documentation that explain these issues, maybe starting from what a manager is and why should be different from the teacher? Thanks in advance for your patience",

          "Text": "Hi Piersante Once you setup Face2face every user will need to go into their individual user profile and enter an email address of their manager or a person who will approve their enrolment.  This is a must. The Face2face add-on uses a two-tier approval process. The first tier is the manager. Once the user sets their managers email address, they can go to a course and enrol. Upon their enrolment an email will be sent to their manager. The email will contacin a link for the manager to login and approve the enrolment. Once the manager has approved the enrolment, an email will be sent to the course coordinator /s. The course cordinator is anyone who has been given teacher or manager role within the course. You need to set these roles for every course. To approve the enrolment as a course coordinator, the person who has been allocated teacher or manager role for the course will log in and go to Site pages (left had side under home) and select Course coordinator approval. This is where the lis of students who have been approved to attend will show up for the course coordintor to approve to attend the course. Once the course coordinator approves the student, this completes the process. Please remember to set your course to use the Face2face add-on. Go to the course and under Users > Enrollment methods select Enrol Approval and move that to the top of the list (select the blue arrow). I normall delete the \"Self enrolment (student)\" if that is on the list. If it is grey out you dont need to worry. Manaul enrolments is normally at the bottom when using the Face2face add-on. You now need to set up your Face2face add-on by adding an activity. Go into the course, make sure editing is on and on the first topic you need to add a activity. Find the Face-to-face activity and select Add. You must add a name. I suggest you type in the name of the course as this will show up on the 2 emails as part of the enrolment process. You must check the following boxes: Approval required. Send notice to manager (confirmation message) Send notice to manager (Reminder message) Send notice to manager (Cancellation message) Click on Save and return to course Get a normal user with only student role to find the course and see is it asks you to enrol and put a justification in. Hope this helps Peter",

          "Text": "Thanks a lot. Very clear and enlighting. The only information that was missing is that you must create an user field in the user profile and populate it with the manager email for each student, This is very different from what the FAQ say, as they suggest that the field is already there. Not only this was not clear from the documentation, but it is cumbersome, as the default manager address is only inherited by new (or updated) users. I had to open and save all the students profiles one by one, to let them to get it (I suspect that I could have added the email address to the data user field table directly in the database , but I didn't dare to try). I find it also illogical, as the manager would usually belong to the activity rather than to the students (students might have different facetoface activities , each with a different manager), so one would expect it to be defined in the session properties, rather than globally. Nevertheless, thanks to your note I was qickly able to put the module at work and I find it wonderful and very flexible. I now have one more question: the confirmation email has fields for venue, room and location, which in my case are empty. Where do you set them? thanks, piersante",

The previous message (which referred to https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=200970 ) called out a location in course/lib.php. The code has changed, however, and I believe in Moodle 2.5 the place is in course/renderer.php , in the course_session_cm_text() function, at about line 775. However, just adding this code at that spot still leaves the link to the face-to-face activity in place, so you see both the list of sessions and the link to the activity.  I didn't like that, so I made another change, as follows. In the same course/renderer.php file, but in the course_section_cm_name() function, near line 670, there is code like this: \n```text\n   $url = $mod->get_url();\n\n\n    if (!$url) {\n\n\n         return $output;\n\n\n    }\n```\n Following that code, I added a clause like this: \n```text\n  if ($mod->modname == 'facetoface') {\n\n\n       return $output;\n\n\n  }\n```\n Between these two changes it seems to do what I want. However, I tried turning on debug messages, and found a number of warning messages, even though it appears to work well enough as described in the link above.  I have not yet had a chance to try to fix those warnings.",

I hard coded it into the module instead of making the feature selectable because I was in a hurry and am not a pro at PHP. Nevertheless, as a result of poking around in the code, I do know where the lines are that simply need to be commented out if you only want to remove the ability to cancel. But, you said you don't have access to the php files right...? I don't think it would be that hard to simply add a toggle/tick box that allows for canceling or no canceling. If I get some time I'll work with it a little and if I actually managed to get something working I will offer it to Alastair who I think is the current maintainer. Regards Jason",

(Actually, anything which is held in the mdl_facetoface_session_data). However, if you do the backup with user data, and restore without user data, then it works. The issue is within the backup_facetoface_stepslib.php - line 128 $session_data_element->set_source_table('facetoface_session_data', array('sessionid' => backup::VAR_PARENTID)); which does the back up of the data only if user data is selected. I would recommend it be removed out of the user backup section and place it in the data backup section. (I moved it to line 121 before the line if ($userinfo) { This allows things like location to be backed up without user data. Cheers Peter",

To resolve these I had to make changes to mod/facetoface/db/upgrade.php, I've attached the patch to this post. To summarise the issues: $dbman->add_field(), create_table() and drop_field() appears to return void so don't assign this to $result. (This appears to be already known: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=217299 ). $OUTPUT->notification() is an empty object, add $OUTPUT to the list of globals at the start of xmldb_facetoface_upgrade(). Property $DB->debug isn't accessible (protected) so remove these. The second parameter for $DB->get_records() should be either null or an array. The field list for $DB->get_records() should be in the fourth parameter. Unless of course there's something very wrong with my installation. All the best, Leon",

A 'wait-listed session' in the Face-to-face module is a session for which no date is currently set.

There is no way at this time to \"exceed\" the capacity of a given session but this can be approximated by adding a second session without a date on which users can sign-up if the other one is full.",

Of course, as I have customised both, I went back to basics to find it, and here is what I found. Regardless of the result of the Face to Face session, (Fully attended, partially attended, no show) Face to Face still injects a completion status of 1 into the table mdl_course_modules_completion . (Note - if course completion is set to require 100% to pass, this is not an issue - just reporting through Activity Tracker, which utilises the completionstatus flag in mdl_course_modules_completion ) Now one could argue either way for this - that they technically have completed the module, however got a pass mark of 0%, or they have not completed the module because they didn't turn up. Myself - I argue the second option - but interesting to see other thoughts out there. Any one with thoughts? Cheers Peter",

An email is sent to the manager, and the student - all is good. However, the student is not given an indication on the screen that they are waitlisted, so they can sign in again. The big gotcha, is once they sign in a second time, even once they are approved and the status as an admin says booked, the end user still has the status as being able to sign up. They will NEVER see on their screen that they are booked in - they will always get the option to sign up. Of course, if they sign up again AFTER they are approved, then they get un-booked and put as waiting for approval, and the whole cycle starts again. Any thoughts? This is latest iteration of F2F and moodle 2.4.3+ (Dated this week) Cheers Peter",

Having tested it a bit I can get the student grades to flow through to the grades book; manually add and remove students and take attendance as intended. Apart from unselecting the site role it seems to work well for me. Cheers Mark",

My idea was to: 1- Enable the Completion tracking \"Show activity as complete when conditions are met \" for facetoface to unlock the conditions \"Require view\" and \"Require grade\". 2- Create a third condition call \"Session is over\" which, if enable, will consider the course module for the current user as complete IF the current user is still signup for a session with the status \"session over\" 3- implement the condition \"session is over\" in the module facetoface and in moodle. For now it is working, I based the condition \"session is over\" on the condition \"require view\" and now every time the course page is view the condition check if the current user is still signup for a session over. I had to modify many things, I explain all the modifications I had to make in the .txt document. I am still working on to try a maximum to not modify the moodle code but the facetoface code instead, I would be very happy to have your opinion or your ideas to improve what I have done so far. Also i create a php file : Session_over.php to put at the root of facetoface.I wanted to give you the modified php files but when I create this discussion I couldnt upload more than 100kb.",

For example, on a Debian system running Apache , that's /var/log/apache2/error_log Also, another thing to check would be your version of PHP. Are you running PHP4 or PHP5?

The default setting is to show on calendar, and if you're co-ordinating training sessions that sounds like the right thing to do. The tick box option can't be disabled by the administrator without hacking the code. If the calendar populated was the course one instead of the site calendar it wouldn't be an issue. After testing this I've also found that if someone saves the event with those default settings then edits to uncheck the calendar box the events remain visible in the global calendar (I'd call that a bug too).",

I'd also say that the other two complaints are best served by feature requests as neither are technically a bug. A bug is when something doesn't function the way it was intended, in this case each function behaves exactly the way it was designed and are perfectly usable for many scenarios. However, I would agree that adding a way to set the global default for whether an event appears on the calendar or not and an easy way to remove events from the calendar would be useful new features.",

I haven't used them before, but it seems like they provide a way to post notices for particular sessions, dependent on the custom field values for that session. So if you have some special instructions that apply to a particular session or group of sessions you can use it to inform the attendees. Apparently the notice appears in the new version of the face-to-face block (not yet on moodle.org but available here: http://git.catalyst.net.nz/gw?p=blocks-facetoface.git;a=summary ). > Currently they can only be defined as one phrase. In a multi-lingual site this may be > problematic as different users using different languages may need to see different translations >of the field. This is a difficult issue, because at the moment there is no way to add new language strings using the language string editor, so if you create a new custom field there's no way to create a language string for it. The session custom fields is based off the User profile fields code, so presumably this is also a problem for user custom fields too? Simon",

It doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes sessions appear on learner calendars with the times from a different session. For example, let's say that Joe is signed up for two different courses: Tuesday at 10:30 AM Wednesday at 10:30 AM In Joe's calendar, the Tuesday session appears correctly as being at 10:30 AM. However, his Wednesday session shows up as being at 2:30 PM (which happens to be the time of another available session, but he isn't signed up for that). I've verified that Joe is enrolled in the right sessions, and Joe can see the correct time if he enters the activity through the weekly outline rather than the calendar. Everything in the activity itself is right, but somehow the information is getting lost when it gets shared with the calendar. Any ideas on why this might be happening? -Christy Tucker",

The second is for the online learning content where we have uploaded scorm content. The course is sequential meaning that the online content does not become available until the user completes the live instruction course. I tried using Activity Locking (I'm don't fully understand all of its features yet) but the problems I have are two fold: 1 - We run the same live instruction course in dozens of cities. Each instance/session is its own face-to-face and a user need only attend one face to face session to be eligible for the online content. It seems as if the activity lock is an all or nothing proposition, I can't set it to say that any face-to-face attendance would qualify to unlock the online learning content. 2 - The online learning content is accessible for 60 days from the face-to-face/live session attendance. Any ideas on how to control this? Right now we do this manually. Thank you",

          "Text": "Hi Jon. As for issue one if you open just one face-to-face activity but then open different sessions for that activity (these can be on different times and in different locations) this should solve your problem. Actually, I think this should be the correct use of this activity. The only times we open more than one face-to-face activity, is when there is a significant difference between the two - e.g. begineer vs. advanced intructor-led training. I have an idea concerning issue 2. If you use groups and groupings, you can then put the online content (SCORM) to be visible only to a specific grouping , and then define the availability of this resource/activity according to when the group had the training. So, if you put copies of the SCORM activity in the course, only the group members would see it according to the availability setting set within the actvity. Using groups/groupings would also prove valuable to track the grades and completion of activities per group. You can distribute the people in the groups or perhaps better yet - avoiding manual work - give each group a unique key for course enrolment and they are then automatically put into their group. One more thing - is there a specific reason you put the online and face-to-face activities in different courses? Wouldn't it be easier for learners if you put it in the same course - say in topic 1 and topic 2? Best of luck. Ask more if I was not clear.",

The more sessions we have the harder it gets to find which session someone attended, it would be great if I could type in a part of someones name and have it list all the names in each session that match. This would work ok as a block but I would like to have it built into the face-to-face module. Any ideas? Finding which sessions a person signed up for is an issue because the way the Face-to-Face module works now a student can only sign up for one session per activity. If they sign up for a session and don't attend, they can't sign up for another session until they are removed form the roster of the first session. It would be much quicker to search for their name then it is to go though the attendee list of all the past sessions to find and remove them. Thanks,",

On my sandbox environment, the email is sent immediately after I assign an attendee to the session, which can cause problem if I select the wrong person in the list for example. I would like to explore different ways: - either having a confirmation button before sending the confirmation email (kind of approving the attendee's list, that would send the email to the whole list at one time) - or be able to setup a number of days before the session date to send the email for ex. 7 days before (my session events are often de-scheduled ans re-scheduled so I do not want to pollute users mailbox for nothing). This feature could also be used for reminder emails some days before the session. I have seen we can disable the email confirmation. If I do so and enable it while having already a list of attendees, what happens ? can we then send the confirmation mail to the list ?? Did anyone already developped something on this subject ? Feedbacks appreciated. Thanks for your help Sandrine",

If you need to remove them from the course before the reminder is sent out, then you can do so from the same page.

If yes, what triggers this email and how can I cutomiez it ? would the workaround be to open the course to guest and what would be the consequences ? - If I follow your tip, then the user will only receive the remider message, and no confirmation message, right ?

How can we do this with the Moodle existing modules ? Thanks for help,",

After entering a session with a duration of a few hours, I edited it and added another date for that session. I change the duration fro, 8 to 14 hours. For some reason the duration shown is now several hundred hours!!! I have tested it more thanm once and it happens each time. My config. is: Latest release of moodle 1.9.5+. Latest version of face-to-face module. If at all relevant I added : Integration in course page: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Integrating_Face-to-face_sessions_on_the_course_page and code tweak by Tiberiu for adding site calendar events of session as described here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=109883 Has anyone experienced something similar?",

We use Moodle to train technicians around the world but one state requires us to provide face-to-face classes for the technician's first training. After they have taken the face-to-face class they are able to renew their training by taking a course online. (Our training certificates expire every 2 years) The problem is setting up a course just for that particular state that has enrollment limited to those technicians that have already taken a face-to-face class. Some changes would probably need to be made to the core Moodle files as well as the face-to-face code but I would love to have the face-to-face attendence be linked to the online course enrolment somehow. I don't want to have them automatically enrolled in the online course after they attend the face-to-face so the current external enrollment modules won't work for me. When a students attempts to enroll in the online course I would like to have moodle check to verify they have already taken the related face-to-face class, if they have they are enrolled, if they haven't they are told they need to take the face-to-face class first.",

          "Text": "All I needed a way to make an individual session unavailable for booking.  Basically the instructor wanted to add students to specific sessions manually without the student signing up themselves.  To do this I changed the code in face-to-face/lib.php as shown below: // Only numbers allowed here $session->capacity = preg_replace('/[^\\d]/', '', $session->capacity); $MAX_CAPACITY = 100000; if ($session->capacity < 0) { //changed from a 1 to a 0 to allow session capacity to be set to 0 so sessions can be closed. $session->capacity = 1; } elseif ($session->capacity > $MAX_CAPACITY) { $session->capacity = $MAX_CAPACITY; } The scenario is this:  The instructor has a session that has 25 seats, but 15 of those seats need to be held for a specific department.  Once those 15 seats are filled then the instructor opens the session for anyone else that wants to register.  Setting the capacity to 0 effectively allows the session to be created but makes the session unavailable for students to book.  The instructor(s) adds the 15 students from the department and then two weeks before class starts they change the capacity to the actual capacity of the class opening up the remaining seats to whoever wants to book it. I hope I have explained this well.  In my testing it seems to be working beautifully, I just wonder if I am breaking something else by doing this.  ANy thoughts of comments? Scott Karren",

First, when adding attendees to a face to face through the add/remove attendees screen I am able to add more attendees then has been set in capacity, is this by design or a bug? Second, When a user signs up and selects to receive email and icalendar they are getting two emails one with the confirmation message and one with the ical attachment, again is this by design or a bug. Third, is it possible to attach an html editor to the details or email message editors so that html messages can be sent? The last is more of a request for information, I am not sure what all is involved in making that happen. The first two, if they are bugs I will log tracker issues for them. Scott",

Please file a bug though if it causes any problems (e.g. display problems). The second issue is configurable in the site-wide activity settings. Some mail readers (e.g. GroupWise) turn iCal attachments into a calendar item and make the email disappear completely. These people will need to enable the dual-email option if they want their staff to be able to read the confirmation email. As for the HTML editor, it would be possible to do this, but it hasn't been implemented yet. It is on our TODO list, it simply hasn't been a priority yet. Cheers, Francois",

I would try to keep the plain text version in there as well for those people who can't get HTML emails (e.g. corporate policy).

User-level activity reports (\"Outline\" and \"Complete\" reports) are also populated. Other noteworthy improvements: The module now uses a custom field on the user profile page for the manager's email address instead of the MSN field. The attendance data is now stored in the gradebook. Important bug fixes: The session key is now checked in all user forms. The take attendance page now displays the actual attendance and allows teachers to untick checkboxes. iCalendar appointments are no longer sent for wait-listed sessions. Remove internationalisation from log entries. Default email messages are no longer set in the site-wide settings page, they should simply be overridden in the language pack. Francois, Catalyst IT",

Yes, my original thought was to be able to display the information as part of the course summary so that students would be able to sign up for a f2f session from the available courses page. Thinking about it further it seems that it would make more sense as an enrollment plug-in. Something that would allow the students to sign up for the session they want without having to first enroll in the course and then sign up. One of the things that is a bit inconvenient is the fact that students need to enroll in the course, then sign up for a session. I now have two course rosters that I need to manage, if the student wanted to un-enroll from the course they would first have to cancel the f2f session and then un-enroll. Does this make sense? I am not a developer by any means but I would be willing to invest sometime to take a stab at it if you can point me to the correct files and provide some advice. Scott Karren",

Perhaps a description of how your courses are organized and how they relate to the Face-to-face activities would help us figure out a way to support your workflow better.",

I will have one class that I teach five different times throughout the next two months. Students will sign-up for one three hour session and then go online to download the materials needed for the class. Once class is completed they will go back online to complete the class assessment and evaluation. I could put the f2f activities in the first topic of a course and then all subsequent materials in other topics, but students still face the inconvenience of signing up twice for the course. What I kinda envision is that a student will select the course they want from the available courses list, the sessions sign-up screen will appear, the student will select the session they want to attend and then be taken to the course screen itself showing what session they are signed up for and have access to all materials. Again, I wonder if this would be something more suited as an enrollment plugin instead of an activity within a course? Let me know your thoughts or if you have additional questions. Scott Karren",
