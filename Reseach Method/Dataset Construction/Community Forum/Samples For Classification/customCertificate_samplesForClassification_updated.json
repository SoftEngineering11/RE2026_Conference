          "Text": "Moodle 3.8 Hi All, I have been trying without success to get the Custom Cert plugin to send HTML emails instead of the plain text. I was able to get our regular emails going out as HTML (new user, password reset, etc) but no matter what I try, Custom Cert only sends the very vanilla plain text email. We'd like to be able to add our logo/brand to the email like with the other Moodle emails to make it look less like a suspicious email. So far I have tried creating custom mustache files and putting them in our theme's template folder as this worked for the general Moodle emails. I even tried putting them in a 'customcert' subfolder in the theme's template folder but the email still draws from the customcert mod template folder. I even tried editing the html mustache file directly in the plugin folder but still only pulls plain text. Purged caches too. I did get it to send HTML email once while I was trying to test, but have no clue what prompted it to do that. Does anyone else have this issue? Any insight would be much appreciated!",

I'm trying to have a certificate (or locked?) hidden until the user has completed (and scored a certain %) on a quiz, which is in the course as a SCORM activity (created w/Articulate quizmaker). I have found where you can link a certificate to a lesson and have it appear only once the conditions have been met in that lesson. The problem is that I don't believe SCORM can be added to a lesson page. Any ideas on how to have a certificate available only once the user has reached a certain score on a SCORM quiz? Thanks!",

It works very well. I have the following requirements: 1. How to add new elements other than those listed in the Add Elements list box under \"Edit custom certificate\". For example I need only the student's last name(surname) printed on the certificate. Currently Full name(Father's+Student's name)appears on the certificate if I add Studentname element to the certificate. Also I like to add new elements from the Student's profile. 2.\nI want the Verify Certificate option to be available in the Moodle Home Page without login. The verification is most needed for Employers who like to check the authenticity of a job applicant's certificates in his Resume. We cannot expect every Employer to create an account and login to moodle to check the Certificate Code. Currently the Verification works only for those who have admin access. There are my immediate requirements. Can anybody help. Thanks in advance.",

          "Text": "In general the certificate activity works. Sometimes there may be some fuss in the details. The certificate module is designed to issue a certificate semi-automatically, so no one needs to create the certficate paper manually, check for prerequisites and send the paper to the participants. You should define clearly, what \"having passed the course\" means. Based on that definition the locking conditions should be configured in the certificate. Some thoughts on things that can happen: Students should be instructed that passing the course and receiving the certificate is a two-step operation. Students do not receive the certificate automatically after finishing the test, they have to open the certificate activity by themselves. Sometimes a certificate can be locked, allthough all conditions are met. In this case logging off and logging in again can do the trick. There are issues also discussed in this forum that certificates stay locked when teachers have changed the grade of a quiz manually. I think there is a fix for this. If the certificate shall be completely user-driven: you can always deactivate any locking options. Then everyone can obtain a certificate, as long as he is student in the course. If the certificate shall be completely teacher-driven: combine the certificate with an assignment activity. Students apply to the teacher that they want a certificate, and the teacher can grant it by giving the appropriate grade.",

Choose one of the user profile fields for your info, good choices are: ID Number, Institution or Department. 2. Same as step 2 from 'Adding a New Line of Text' above. 3. Add a new line below that to print your info like this: cert_printtext(170, 350, 'C', 'Times', , 10, utf8_decode($USER->idnumber)); Or, change idnumber to institution, or department. 4.

Here's what I have...it essentially creates an associative array of your user profile fields, so you can later call them in your certificate file...on my wishlist, would be to create a custom user data object, so we could refer to the fields like $userfields->Cardnumber (so its the same as the $certdata obj). Maybe this weekend I can get to that, but just wanted to put this out there as soon as I figured something out. In view.php, add the following lines after line 67 ($certrecord = get_record('certificate_issues', 'certificateid', $certificateid, 'userid', $USER->id);): \n```text\n // Custom Query For User Profile Fields\n```\n \n```text\n $\nsql\n = \"SELECT f.shortname, d.data FROM `\".$CFG->prefix.\"user_info_data` d, `\".$CFG->prefix.\"user_info_field` f WHERE f.id=d.fieldid AND userid = \".$USER->id.\";\";\n```\n \n```text\n $result = get_records_sql($sql);\n```\n \n```text\n if ($result) {\n```\n \n```text\n foreach($result as $key=>$value) {\n```\n \n```text\n $extended_user_data[$value->shortname]=$value->data;\n```\n \n```text\n }\n```\n \n```text\n }\n```\n \n```text\n // End Custom Query Section\n```\n Then, add lines such as the following to your certificate.php file: \n```text\ncert_printtext(150, 150, 'C', 'Times', '', 30, utf8_decode(\"TEST: \".$extended_user_data['<YourFieldHere>']));\n```\n The <YourFieldHere> part is replaced by the shortname of the custom field you need displayed. I have put the view.php file on here as an attachment, though I can't promise that what I have is the latest and greatest...sometime soon I need to figure out CVS !

The role of the location champion is to coach is collegues in doing the courses, as we are 24/7 company. The location champion is allowed to see the scores of his collegues within his location or location's And also to view the certificates A location champion can be a firstline manager but sometimes he is a one of the guys, primus interpares So to let him view the certificates I allow in this role \" certificate:manage\" (Manage Certificates) This is all-right: He can download /view his own certificate, when he is student (he can have a double role) He can view the certificates of his collegues (ie within his groups in a report (see all xxx certificates)) But he can not see his OWN certificate in this report view. Actually this certificate disappears from this report also when viewed as an administrator Questions: Is this intentional. If I do want this what do I have to change?",

I edited the ceritifcate.php file in the lang/en/ folder, added some additioanl strings, tinkered with the string attributes in the the certificate.php file in the type/ mytype / folder. Since it didn't look like my new strings were taking, I purged my cache. I had done this for other items and it was not a problem. This time it was. The entire site went down for about 5 minutes, and when it came back up, I went straight back to my cert. I could view it (my changes still didn't take), but now, I cannot edit it, either by selecting the \"edit\" icon in the course view, or by selecting the Certificate administration>Edit settings link in my Settings block. I checked various other activities and found I could edit them as usual, but not the Certificate activity. I took a look through tables in the database that looked like they were associated with the Certificate activity to see if anything obvious jumped out at me, but couldn't. My old cert I had generated was still there, and I can look at it, but I can't edit it. I can't even add a new one. Is this something that only is affecting the Certificate module, and that I can fix by reinstalling it, or is this a sign of a more serious problem?",

If not this would be a strong indication that in making some customization you have somewhat broken your mod/certificate/type/mytype/certificate.php file. Last thing : where a Moodle user have a problem it is always good to go to Site Administration > Development > Debugging and to set debugging messages level to DEVELOPPER then to return to the pages where the problem is located to see if any error message is displayed and if it is, copy these messages (the complete text) on the forum.

When a user completes a course via the mobile app (using an Android device), they can access & download their custom certificate after completing the course, but there is not a place in their mobile user profile where they can access the issued certificate directly after they've downloaded it. They have to get back into the course in to access it and save it manually from the downloaded file. When these same actions are done on the PC application, the downloaded certificate automatically shows up in the PC user profile. Do I need to add something into the settings to allow custom certificates in the Moodle app? I have searched all the settings and read the FAQs for mobile, but I can't find anything that shows how to correct this issue. Please advise....",

          "Text": "What is possible : Somebody with php knowledge can modify your certificate code so that questions are asked before certificate issue and the answers to this questions used on certificate printing. The problem is that to do that you will need to modify files outside of the /type subfolder of the certificate folder. And later when you would want to upgrade to a new certifictae version you would have to redo the changes at each upgrade . My opinion is that creating new certificates types (new subfolders in the /type subfolder) or adding new images in the /pix subfolder is safe because you can still upgrade your certificate mod later. But my advice is to avoid any modification outside of the /type and /pix subfolders because future upgrades will become a real pain. Or : 2nd solution You can't create a pdf (interactive or not) with some pdf creator software (like Adobe acrobat) and use that pdf during your certificate creation. The reason is that the TCPDF library that certificate module use to create the pdf is not able to do that. But there are other existing libraries (like FPDI + TCPDF or Zend PDF) that can merge several pdf. So here also a programmer should be able to create a modified certificate suiting your needs. As always with computer programming, nearly everything is possible ... with a good programmer (and the money to pay him). Please when you start such customized developpment, don't forget that later it will need some maintenance !!",

So if I change the Print Date to: Print Date: <last topic - Final Exam> I do get the correct date.  I could go change them all to just use that field, but I want to make sure 1) I haven't found a bug, and 2) maybe I just don't understand what \"course completed\" date means so I'd like to figure that out. The older version that I had installed worked with the \"course completion\"  The version was: 2012010501 I believe. Thanks for the help. Oh and the Moodle version I'm using is: Moodle 2.1.5+ (Build: 20120323) The Certificate Version for branch 21 is: 2012022001 Both should be the lastest for their respective branches.",

I have have a course that has conditional activities : a quiz, viewing an activity and 75% pass grade. There is also a requirement to be in the course for minimum of 60 minutes which is set in the certificate settings. I notice the certificate completion is set to view this activity to complete it. I have tested the course and when I click on the link for the certificate, I get a message that says 'you need to be in the course for a minimum of 60 minutes'. I timed myself to to make sure I was in the course for 80 minutes. Would appreciate it if someone wiser that me could tell me how to fix this. I have spent hours searching Moodle docs , forums and fiddling around - my frustration level is high. Thanks in anticipation. Fiona",

No disrespect to any of the developers, but I have always (since 2007) had trouble with time in a course, so I don't use it as a condition.  This is not just related to the certificate module. I have a new 2.9.2 Moodle localhost with the certificate version below. Sounds like a bug. $plugin->version   = 2015083100; // The current module version (Date: YYYYMMDDXX) $plugin->requires  = 2015051100; // Requires this Moodle version In my certificate course, I have two students.  I setup a simple two question quiz and a new certificate.  I first set conditions that a user had to only spend 2 minutes in the course.   Student 1 took the quiz and passed, stayed in the course for over 4 minutes. Clicked on the certificate and was told they had to stay in the course 2 minutes to receive the certificate. I turned on activity completion for the course.  I left the 2 minute condition in certificate and set an additional restriction that the student needed 80% on the short quiz.   Logged in as Student 2.   Passed the quiz, was logged into the course for over 4 minutes.  Same result. The thing to do is to put in a bug with tracker.  No more time left this AM, may revisit and do it this PM. Chris",

The course I refer to requires that a student be in the course for 60 minutes in order to gain professional development points. Do you think there is any issue with the time requirement being in the certificate settings? Maybe this then requires you to be in the certificate for 60 minutes even though it says 'time required in course'. This may be a silly question as I'm not a coder/developer, but I'm grasping at straws. My only option at this stage is to leave the conditions in place so I can see that a person has met them, check the logs for their time spent inside the course and issue a certificate manually. It's not ideal but is a work around. Do you know if the developer of the plug in is involved in its continuing development? Fiona",

I am working with this plugin, which is working perfectly in my Moodle site, but I would like to make an improvement on it, but before starting I may ask here in case someone has worked on it before. I have looked for something related in these forums but haven't found nothing. The idea is to add some kind of blockchain verification instead of that verification code. I mean, adding the certificate into blockchain so it cannot be edited as pdf and anyone can find it by searching in the blockchain. May sound strange, or maybe it is not possible with this plugin, but I got to ask. If someone knows something about it or related with it I would be extremely grateful. Thank you for reading.",

Certificate is issued only the user views the certificate in the course view page even if user has not completed the course he/she can view the certificate. So, we can put restriction to access the certificate only if course is completed using https://moodle.org/plugins/availability_coursecompleted plugin. It will allow to add the restriction in certificate settings (refer the screenshot in the plugin). So, the certificate module will be disabled until the user completes the course. Hope it helps!

Secondly, if a student re-enrols onto a course for a re-take then they will find that their existing record of achievement will enable them to collect their certificate without retaking the assessment. However, some time back we commissioned Chardelle to develop a certificate option for us which a) allows certificates to be re-issued and b) uses the latest pass date on the certificate itself. We have since granted permission for this to be included in Moodle version 2 development. Printing an expiry date should be possible by adding a calculation to the certificate.php itself, or simply adding custom text to say \" This certiticate is valid for 12 months from the date shown\". I agree with you that a mechanism for alerting students to re-take an assessment is a nice idea but I suspect that this would involve a completely new module and to be honest, should be attached to an assessable activity such as a quiz rather than an optional certificate. Hope this helps. Lester",

I used this to print something that says August 20, 2018 thru August 21, 2018.  But they'd really like it to be the 20-21 thing instead: $dayTwo = str_replace(' 0', ' ', strftime('%B %d, %Y',(strtotime(\"+1 days\" .certificate_get_date($certificate, $certrecord, $course))))); certificate_print_text($pdf, $x, $y + 340, 'C', 'centurygothic', '', 20, certificate_get_date($certificate, $certrecord, $course)); certificate_print_text($pdf, $x + 300, $y + 360, 'L', 'centurygothic', '', 20, \"to\"); certificate_print_text($pdf, $x + 20, $y + 360, 'C', 'centurygothic', '', 20, utf8_decode(\"\".$dayTwo)); Lastly, what fields does certrecord have?

Navigate to to this folder in your moodle installation: mod/certificate/type 2. Create a new folder in this directory called \"wallet\". 3. Copy the certificate.php file in the letter_non_embedded to the directory you just created. 4. You will need to modify elements in this php file to get the position and size right for a wallet card. Get to know the contents of the file and things should start to become clearer as to what you need to modify. What this approach will do is allow the student to print out the wallet sized certificate on a regular letter sized peice of paper. They just need to cut it out and laminate it if they wish. In our design department they are making a mock-up with a dashed line to cut along. 5. Lastly, you will need to add a line to the language file of the certificate plugin to display the new certificate type correctly in the drop-down selector when you create a new certificate in the course. Navigate to mod/certificate/lang/en/ and open certificate.php 6. On line 164 you will see the default types included with the certificate plugin. Add a new line under 167 and put this there: $string['typewallet'] = 'Wallet'; Save your work and you should be good! Hope that helped, or at least got you on the right track =)",

Moodle 2.6.2+ (Build: 20140411) ( server side CentOS) Adobe Reader X and XI (version 11.0.06) (client side) Windows 7 Pro, SP1 (client side) ----------- From my research, this appears to be an issue with Adobe. It is affecting a small percentage of my users but I expect this to change as more people deploy Adobe Reader X and XI on Windows. In Moodle: I created a custom border that is a JPEG (size 502782 bytes, 1024x831). No other image is added to this image by the certificate module, just text. Go to the certificate module and click on \"Get your certificate\" Delivery is set to \"Open in new window\" On Windows Internet Explorer (v11): A separate window opens with another dialog box containing: \"An internal error occurred\". Click on Ok Now here's where it gets fun. You can still save the certificate (which is blank in appearance) to disk. Then, open the image with Chrome (v 30.0.1847.116) and it displays correctly (because Chrome doesn't use Adobe to render, it uses its own PDF engine). From my research on Adobe, it appears to have something to do with advanced security, protection mode settings and the sandbox. I have exhausted changing the configuration of Adobe Reader in Preferences under settings. The symptom of \"An internal error occurred\" is all over the boards but the various solutions (including registry edits) have not worked. Also, if I save my custom JPEG image as a PNG and use the PNG as my border, Adobe Reader works but the PNG is even a bigger file then the JPEG and the display quality is bad. One difference (besides the size) between my JPEG and the JPEGs that come with the certificate's module is my JPEG has the color profile sRGB IEC61966-2. I've upgraded tcpdf from 6.0.031 to 6.0.065 to no avail. As I said, this appears to be an issue with Adobe Reader, however Moodle users may start to see this problem plus I can't prove it is Adobe Reader, tcpdf, or Moodle. I haven't seen anything in the error log either. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

The certificate is saved into the \\moodledata\\2\\moddata\\certificate\\64\\3 folder on the server .

There is no primary key on the mdl_certificate table or the mdl_certificate_issues tables.

We have been using your excellent mod on our Moodle site for a\nnumber of years now but have also had a problem with dates on our\ncertificates.

Just for some background, our courses consist of a SCORM package\ncreated in Articulate Storyline which gives the user a grade for a quiz\nbuilt into the SCORM package. The details of the grade...etc are then\npassed back to Moodle and the user then prints a certificate based on\nthe score attained Our workaround has been to delete the old certificate from the users\naccount. Is there any way you could tell me where this information is\nstored in the Moodle database , and I can run a MariaDB script to clear\ndown this table on an hourly basis to prevent this happening.

The course setup in Moodle is minimal. Each course consists of two sections , one to run the SCORM activity and another to print the certificate. I see your point about picking the current system date as the date to print on the certificate, but this could cause problems for us in that we take the user attempts data out of Moodle and populate our HR system's training history for employees with the Moodle data. This could, if we use the system date, rather than the date the activity is completed, cause confusion if during our internal training audit processes, a discrepancy is found between the traininging history and the certificate dates. This leaves us with little option but to use the SCORM activity completion date in the certificate What do you think ?",

I checked the email routing via \"eMail Test\" within the Moodle/Admin/Server area and all seems fine on that end. What I was going to try was uninstalling/reinstalling Custom Certificate as per some advice I have seen in this forum but I am afraid of loosing all my Certificates. I love this plugin, super useful and I have one to two Custom Certificates in most of my courses. If I were to unistall/reinstall, would I loose all Certificates presently in the system (necessitating rebuilding) as well as the historic Verification data? If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it. Thanks in advance for any assistance you can offer,",

Once of the biggest things that has caused headache that we are trying to see if we can change somehow before we do an upgrade is... is there anyway for moodle/course certificate to automatically update the teacher on the certificate without having to go into the certificate, go into the element and select the 'new teacher (even if the old one has been removed from the role), save before that new teacher appears on the certificate. I.e. CURRENT - Teacher is Jane Bloggs (she is no longer doing the course and has been removed from the teacher role - Moodle still uses it on certificates CHANGE TO - Jane Bloggs is no longer the teacher for the course and we've added the new teacher Barry Brown, Moodle/course certificate uses this new teacher for all certificates generated from that point forward? Any assistance would be greater helpful. Jayden",

First step: under course settings / completion tracking you need to activate \"Enable completion tracking\". Second step: each activity of the course now has a section \"Activity completion\", where you may set a certain logic of your choice (this step is kind of optional, as you do not need to set this for all activities ), however... Third step: the \"Certificate Activity\" has a setting \"Restrict Access\", where you should define a logic for the issuance, resp. access to the certificate. In my example I have a course with approx 20 activities, none of them has any requirements for completion whatsoever. Then at the end I have a quiz, with a \"pass\" logic (i.e. 80% of the max grade must be met to \"pass\". Then the certificate can only be issued and accessed when the quiz has been completed with a passing grade. Good luck!",

Then in the certificate I added a dynamic field \"Course: Grade\" wich then shows me the actual mark (e.g. 29) on the certificate, which is useless as it does not compare to the total. There is also no option for a calculated field, that I could work with. I am now considering changing the marks in the quiz, so that the total equals to 100, which then means that I can add a simple text \"%\" behind the dynamic field \"Course: Grade\" (as the grade then would equal to the percentage).

          "Text": "This is the cause of the problem: When your student completes a quiz and then clicks the certificate link in the course the Certificate module generates the certificate by inserting a new record into the certificate_issues table. This record contains various details about the certificate, including the DATE that the certificate was issued (certdate) and the GRADE that the student obtained (reportgrade). Then, if the certification requirements have been met (required grade, etc.), the PDF library in Moodle creates the certificate and displays it to the student. So far everything is great. Then the student goes and attempts the quiz again. When this second attempt is submitted the Certificate module adds another record to the grade_grades_history table with old values from the oldid , source , timemodified , itemid , rawgrade , rawgrademax and usermodified columns. Then it UPDATES the grade and timemodified values of the record in the quiz_grades table. Then it ADDS a new record to the quiz_attempts table containing the new attempt number , new grade , timestart , timefinish and timemodified values. Then it UPDATES the questions , sum_grades and grade column values of the original quiz record in the quiz table (the original submission). The next thing that the Certificate module SHOULD do is UPDATE the record for the original certificate (that was previously issued) on the certificate_issues table (which still contains the original reportgrade and certdate values). But the module DOES NOT do this last update and that is why the grade for the last attempt is not displayed! The module should be updating (or deleting???) the original certificate record on certificate_issues with the date and grade details of the most recent attempt that the student submitted. Alternatively, the certification date and grade details shouldn't even be stored on this table. Instead, the Certificate module should retrieve the latest grade details from the grade_grades table whenever the user requests the certificate. I think that this is a better solution... I haven't yet figured out what code needs to be updated to make sure that the above record update is performed, but this is, as far as I can see, the cause of the problem.",

          "Text": "Hi, Moodle fellows. I'm trying to include a second page to a certificate in order to print a syllabus. As in my company it should be well formated, HTML is a must. So, I did the following: inserted a new field in table \"mdl_certificate\" field was named \"secondpage\" , type \"longtext\". It was meant to store the HTML syllabus created a new certificate type (\"MyInstitution\") the \"certificate.php\" for the new type was modified. For test only, just to see if the field could be retrieved, I inserted at the end of the code: $pdf->AddPage(); certificate_print_text($pdf, $x, $y, 'C', 'freeserif', '', 15, $certificate->secondpage); I know there is a correct function to render HTML correct in PDF API, I just don't get there yet! then, I modified \"mod_form.php\" to insert a Editor field: // ######################### // second page text // ######################### $mform->addElement('editor', 'secondpage', get_string('secondpage', 'certificate')); $mform->setType('secondpage', PARAM_RAW); And now I'm having trouble: the editor field is correctly shown in the form, but the HTML code is not saved to the table field nor is retrieved from even if I put some by hand. If I just change the editor field to: $mform->addElement('textarea', 'secondpage', get_string('secondpage', 'certificate'), array('cols'=>'40', 'rows'=>'4', 'wrap'=>'virtual')); $mform->setType('secondpage', PARAM_RAW); everything works, I mean, I can type in the new field and the data is automatically saved to the table field \"secondpage\" . But this is not what I need, because one should code HTML tags manually. I did a pretty wide search but I can't find what is missing: why can't I use the editor object in this way? Can anyone point what I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance.",

I can view the certificates issued in each course but what I'm hoping for is a site wide report based on the certificates issued. Does anyone have a custom sql report that would be able to pull down this information across all courses? Since the 'activity' is not a gradable item, none of our existing reports can select this as the filter. I dont have much experience with SQL reports however i would have expected that if an item has a view to complete option, then we could surely identify this item and those who have completed it. In a combined report i expect ill need to select each course i intend to pull the report from, one by one before running the report which is fine, itd just be great to have the information in one place and to not have to manually combine this.",

I need help with the customcert plugin (version 3.4.5), I'm using version 3.5.5 of moodle, My problem is as follows: I need to release exter nal access at (/mod/customcert/verify_certificate.php) , I know I can do it in the certificate settings, changing the option \"Allow anyone to check a certificate\" . de No ( default ) > Yes , as there are many courses that have certificates with this option, it will be laborious for just one person to make this change. Is there any way to change this setting to Yes for all certificates already created in the Courses, and how can I change the default setting of No > Yes for the next certificates to be created ? I tried to view through MYSQL and edit the php files in the root folder (moodle/mod/custoncert), but I was unsuccessful, I will return what was by default. I am grateful for any help or reference that is made available. 😊 Hugs, Felipe",

When I requested I already had some notion of the change I would need to make in the SQL of the mdl_customcert table, so I gave update on the verifyany attribute for everyone having the value 1 (Yes): mysql> update mdl_customcert set verifyany = 1; thus all certificates already created will be available for external access to use the certificate validator. The second part to define that the next certificates are defined by default for external access was performed the update of the customcert 3.5.8 plugin, in this version it is possible to edit the main certificate settings.

Also, I need to be able to manually input each users original completion date for each certificate; the reason being is each user sometimes needs to complete a certificate from a third party website and I need a way to track all of these via Moodle, so that I do not have to manually notify them every year to complete it again. For example, a program similar to Moodle called Totara describes this: Certifications are sets of courses (1 or more) that are repeated by learners at specific intervals - for example, annually. After receiving system notifications that they must do a certification , users will see the required courses in the list in their required learning. If this is not the first time they have completed the courses then it may be that the certification is set up so that learners do not have to complete overview courses, but instead just have to attempt the assessments associated with these courses. Once learners have completed the certificate they get credited with its completion and they (and their manager) will receive a personalised email confirming this. A year later they will receive an email informing them that they need to retake the course. And all this without a backup in sight!",

Basically we want to be able to assign facilitators to certain groups to be self-sufficient (such is the plan) for their own classes; the materials, discussions, etc. can be built upon from previous classes or concurrent classes. One of the challenges I am running into is with groups and custom certificates.  I would like to have quiz/assessments sorted by group (which seems to work fine) as well as certificates of completion (custom certificates) for those groups (which doesn't seem to work).  The groups would be important in this case because I don't want our facilitators to have to sort through thousands of participants just to find the few who should be marked as completed ~ they ideally would just select their group and then go from there. I did see this post: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=144375 which suggests that the problem has been fixed but it does not seem to be working in my version.  What happens is the quizzes can be viewed by groups but the participants' certificates view looks the same as always. Please let me know if you have any experience with this or helpful pointers,  Thanks in advance!",

To fix your issue simply change (I haven't tested this but it *should* work) the line \"$mods = $modinfo->get_cms();\" to \"$mods = $modinfo->cms;\" in mod/certificate/lib.php.

A 500 error can mean several things and is not limited to one error. I suggest turning debugging on your site (see http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Debugging ) and copying the error message you receive (if at all) from Moodle here.

Add the fonts to your data directory (create a fonts folder there if it doesnt exist). 2. Use the font in the drop-down when adding an element.",

First of all, after the upgrade, all of my certificates had disappeared. I then installed the fixed certificate module that doesn't reference the \"deleted\" column, but the certificates did not reappear. I then tried restoring the certificate from the automated backup for a course, but got a database write error. In checking the debug messages it seems I'm missing a different column altogether: PHP Notice:  Undefined property: stdClass::$timecreated in C:\\inetpub\\ wwwroot \\moodle\\mod\\certificate\\backup\\moodle2\\restore_certificate_stepslib.php on line 55 Default exception handler: Error writing to database Debug: Column 'timecreated' cannot be null INSERT INTO mdl_certificate (name,intro,introformat,emailteachers,emailothers,savecert,reportcert,delivery,certificatetype,orientation,borderstyle,bordercolor,printwmark,printdate,datefmt,printnumber,printgrade,gradefmt,printoutcome,printhours,printteacher,customtext,printsignature,printseal,timemodified,course,timecreated) And then it lists the values it was attempting to restore to the database and the last column is in fact NULL. Is there a work-around for this? And is it possible that my certificates are still in the database, so that I won't have to manually restore them all?",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm looking for some help with the restricted access to a certificate activity in a course which seems to only affect a few students. The restrict access settings are set with greyed out unless these 3 conditions are met: Final exam =>80%, Forums Total =>19%, Chats Total =>15% The students in question are unable to view their certificates. Both say that the certificate activity is greyed out with a message \"Not available until you achieve a required score in Chats Total\", however the students grade books show chats total = 100%. All other access restricted condition scores are well above the settings. So there is no reason the certificate should be unavailable. I suspect that some trigger/action has fired and the certificate activity failed to generate for some reason and now moodle thinks that the trigger/action is completed for these students and doesn't need to be recalculated again or the failure still exists somewhere. Is there anyway I can force moodle to recompute the conditions of the certificate restricted access criteria? Or does anyone have any ideas how I could fix this issue? Thanks.

          "Text": "Hello, I think you are confusing 2 different things language strings that are in files inside the lang subdirectory and defined by lines like $string['statement'] = 'has completed the course'; and data like the student name or the course name that are coming from the database and not from strings in lang files The right solution to customize your certificate is to modify the certificate.php file for your certificate type. For instance if you don't want 'has completed the course' to be printed on the certificate, you should not modify the $string['statement'] but rather remove the line that is printing it in your certificate.php file it should be something like certificate_print_text($pdf, $x, $y + 55, 'C', 'freesans', '', 20, get_string('statement', 'certificate')); just remove this line and this will remove the text on the certificate to remove the course name, remove the line that print it, it should be something like : certificate_print_text($pdf, $x, $y + 72, 'C', 'freesans', '', 20, $course->fullname); And to modify the font for student name you need to edit the line that looks like: certificate_print_text($pdf, $x, $y + 36, 'C', 'freesans', '', 30, fullname($USER)); to change the font change 'freesans' to another font used by the library that create the pdf (warning: you can't use any font that is installed on your computer, only fonts defined in the TCPDF libray and if your certificate has foreign characters you need to use a font that contain these characters or you will get question marks instead of characters) and to change the font size, change the 30 value to something else. Editing the language file should be avoided if possible because  when you will upgrade the certificate module in the future all your changes would be lost and would need to be re-done. I understand al this may seem difficult if you are unfamiliar with programming, so if you don't manage to do what you want, post your certificate.php and explain what you want to do and I will try to help you.",

However, student certificates were no longer loading (Certificate Activity v2008080904). So I downloaded the latest version (v2009080900), renamed the old folder certification_old and copied the new folder over, then logged into the site and went to the Notifications, which comes up blank -- the admin/index.php page has content in it when I open it manually, but it just loads blank when I go to the Notifications link. If I go to the Manage Activities page, the correct version of Certificate ( 2009080900) shows, and when I log in as a student, I can now see the certificates. So it is working. But there is obviously a conflict somewhere, perhaps in the version.php or something. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",

I have used the restrict access for this, the certifcate activity/link appears once the SCORM is completed, which is fine. I did have 'Email to students' checked which I thought, once the SCORM is completed, the link appears and they also get an email with their certificate. However, one of our Directors pinged an email to me about the certificate, but their SCORM activity is currently marked as incomplete which leads me to believe this has been sent to everyone, even though the 'Recipients' only shows that it has gone out to 80 people out of approx 500 people (they were not on this list). Could someone provide me with some insight here? Secondly, the email they forwarded me with the certificate had their name out of alignment, even though on preview and testing my own certificate it came out perfectly aligned. Why is alignment variable amongst various people even though it's the same alignment/positioning of the same certificate? Thanks",

(It had a certificate before, but it stopped working properly after we updated to Moodle 4, so we are replacing the certificates with the latest version.) So in order for the users to get a new copy of their certificate, they will need to login and click the certificate link.  Everything is displaying properly except for the expiry date, which shows 3 years from the date they click on the certificate - not from when the originally took the course. This expiry date is very important and must be displayed on the certificate as per government regulations, so it must be correct. Does anyone have any ideas?  Thank you so much! Kate",

          "Text": "Hi Beat, James is correct, the easiest way to add a line is by including it as an image. If you want another simple way, where the line is added during the creation of the PDF file, then you can use the following code in your certificate.php (located in the certificate type folder) Step 1 : Add the following line characteristics code anywhere in the beginning of the page: \n```text\n$style1 = array('width' => 0.5, 'cap' => 'butt', 'join' => 'miter', 'dash' => 0, 'color' => array(0, 0, 0));\n```\n This line of code indicates the following: line thickness of 0.5, Type of cap to put on the line is 'butt', type of line join is 'miter', dash pattern is 0 (straight line without dashes, if you wish to use dashes, increase this value to have a pattern. For example, the value 2 means 2 dashes on then 2 dashes off..), and finally the color in (R,G,B), (C,M,Y,K) or array(C,M,Y,K,SpotColorName). The 0,0,0 in this instance means black color. Step 2 : place the line command anywhere below the code \"$pdf->AddPage();\",  as follows: \n```text\n$pdf->Line(10, 10, 285, 10, $style1);\n```\n This will draw a line using the line characteristics specified in step 1, with the following dimensions: 10 (this is the horizontal start point) , 10 (this is the vertical start point) , 285 (this is the horizontal end point) , 10 (this is the vertical end point. since the beginning and end of the vertical points is the same, the line remains horizontal. If they are unequal, the line becomes slant) . Repeat step 2 as much as you want to generate lines. The same goes for vertical lines, where the horizontal start and end points remain constant and the vertical ones differ.",

          "Text": "I have a topics-based course with 3 topics, each a SCORM /AICC activity. Each of these is worth 100 points. The certificate is set to require a course grade of 70%. So a total of 300 points for the course and a minimum of 210 points earned to receive a certificate. But when a student has more than 70 points in any of the activities , say 100 points, they are allowed to receive a certificate. Below 70 points the error message displayed is something like \" Your current course grade (60.00%) is below the grade required (100%) to receive your certificate. \" Raw points are displayed as a percentage here, rather than a percentage of the total course points. If a student has 100 points in one activity the gradebook's aggregated course total is 33%, which is correct. So it would seem the certificate module is calculating the score incorrectly somewhere. I can set the Dependent Activities to include each of the activities and requires those scores be 70%, but I really don't want to have to link each and every activity in each course on the site, especially since this worked in Moodle 1.8.2. Is this a bug? Am I missing something in the configuration? Does this work for others, in which case I could reinstall Moodle and maybe fix the problem? Moodle 1.9.2 Certificate module for 1.9",

However, certificates will remain visible for users who have already earned them. Is there a support option or plugin that can help with this? Additionally, I would like to share these custom certificates as images on social platforms, enabling users to view them without logging into the portal, similar to how platforms like Coursera or Udemy operate.

          "Text": "Hi Everyone, After getting some interesting, unexpected, and slightly exasperating outcomes with the certificate module  in Moodle 1.9+ when using linked activity option,  I decided to do a little testing. Typically, we have multiple activities in our workshops and each activity is graded using a Scale (in our case - unsat/sat).   Participants must complete each activity satisfactorily in order to download certificate.   I set the certificate using Linked Activity option and set the activity for a required grade of 100%  (a \"sat\" grade on the scale for the activity).   Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't.  When it doesn't the typical outcome is usually a blank screen when clicking on the certificate link from the home page.   See this certificate testing video to see what I've done so far. (note - Often, the person in the teacher role  will be able to see/download a certificate even when people in the student role can't so make sure to use student test accounts for this.) Since the blank screen outcome seemed random, I began methodically testing various circumstances to discover if there was some sort of pattern to the madness.  My testing isn't complete  (there are hundreds if not thousands of permutations!)  but patterns do seem to be emerging. You can view the results of my tests so far by going to my gdoc spreadsheet .  You don't need a google account to view this. If you'd like to help me test these things out.  I have created a form to easily collect your data.  Feel free to use this form to add your testing data . I look forward to reading about your results or your experiences with the certificate module. Bethany",

I asked my hr colleague, who is actually the person managing the whole courses. my understanding is, the cert is only awarded once after the user takes and finishes the course (not sure if there is a way to allow the same cert be awarded more than once; maybe the user enrolled the course, got the cert; and unenrolled the course and re-enrol it to get the same cert?). And actually she'd like to award the cert to the same person like yearly basis as some courses are required retaken yearly. So ideally the awarded cert expires after 1 year (or any controlled period by the teacher), and then inform the user to retake the same course, finish and re-issue the new cert. currently she creates a brand new course yearly. Did I express clearly? I can dig more if you need more information. Thanks again!",

This lesson is linked to Certificate Gateway. 3. I created Certificate Gateway and it is dependent upon Certificate Qualification with a score better than 80% and is linked to Certificate. I cannot get things to flow correctly when viewing as a student. a) If I click on Certificate Gateway I get a red box that says “Navigation: first page not found” b) If I click Certificate Qualification, I see my quiz and take it. After the final question, I am presented with a page that shows my score as 20 out of 20. Each question was worth 10 points. It then shows “Your current grade is 0.0 out of 0” If I click the link to see the certificate I see a red box that says “Navigation: first page not found” Can anyone help me get this worked out?",

You need to add a bit of html to exclude the link and insert the word certificate:file.php/3/link.html>Post-Course Survey You will need to instruct your audience to look for the feedback link to the certificate. Also, make sure you have general feedback checked in the settings for the activity you are setting as the gateway to the certificate. The only issue I am having with tis method is that it doesn't allow you to hide the certificate link.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, We're currently running Moodle version 4.3.2 and have set `fullnamedisplay` to `alternatename` in order to maintain student anonymity in forums and other areas. This setup ensures that students only see alternate names or first names, which is essential for our privacy requirements. However, we've encountered an issue: Problem: When students generate certificates, the certificates also display only the alternate names or first names, rather than the full names (first name and last name) as needed for official documentation. Our Goal: We want the certificates to always display the user's full name (first name and last name), regardless of the `fullnamedisplay` setting, while still maintaining anonymity elsewhere on the site. What We've Tried So Far: Modifying the `issue.php` File: We attempted to edit the file located at `moodle/mod/coursecertificate/classes/output/issue.php` by changing the line: \n```text\n'fullname'\n => \nfullname\n(\n$this\n->issue),\n```\n To: \n```text\n'fullname'\n => \n$this\n->issue->firstname . \n' '\n . \n$this\n->issue->lastname,\n```\n Purging All Caches: Used the Moodle interface via Site administration > Development > Purge all caches . The Result: The certificates are still displaying only the alternate names or first names, not the full names as intended. Questions: Is there a way to force the certificate to use the user's full name regardless of the `fullnamedisplay` setting? Has anyone successfully customized the certificate generation to display full names while keeping alternate names or first names elsewhere for privacy? Are there alternative approaches or best practices we should consider to achieve this functionality? Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help. Best regards, Jeff TL;DR: We're trying to display full names on certificates while using `fullnamedisplay=alternatename` to maintain anonymity elsewhere. Modifying `issue.php` and purging caches hasn't resolved the issue. Looking for advice on how to achieve full names on certificates without affecting site-wide anonymity settings.",

For all other courses it works  perfect. The only difference with this course, is that this one has 2 exams. For both exams the \"Grade to pass\" has been set to \"8\" and in the setting of the certificate \"Restrict Access\" has been set to the following: Access restrictions: Student must match all of the following: Grade \"Ramp Safety Test\" must be >= \"80%\" AND Grade \"Marshaling\" must be >= \"80%\" I do see all the grades of the students though, and if I go to the If I go to \"My certificates\" of a student, I only see certificates from other courses they did. Anyone an idea what I'm missing here? Thank in advance! Moodle 3.11.1 (Build: 20210712) Custom Certificate versions: 3.11.1",

The bit above in yellow really only tells Moodle that there is a capability called'mod/certificate:view'. The rest is just details. You will see that $mod_certificate_capabilities is an array. You can define as many capabilities as you like by adding more elements to the array. When a plugin is installed or upgraded, the list of capabilities is loaded from .../db/access.php and stored in the database . Admins control which users have which capabilities by going to Admin -> Users -> Permissions -> Define roles in the Admin UI. (Some of the yellow details above are about setting the defaults for those admin settings.) The other things that affect what a user can do are what role assignments they have, and whether there are any role overrides. The place to put code like has_capability('mod/certificate:viewmycertificatesreport', get_context_instance(CONTEXT_SYSTEM)) is the place where it currently says is_primary_admin, and Kaalgat - told you to change it. However, if you are not very confident messing with PHP code, it may be better to wait for the maintainers of this bit of code to make the necessary changes, and release an updated version of the module.",

Prestty sure I've skipped some step. A couple hints: 1) I have not filled the \"verification\" field in plugin settings page (don't understand what this is for) 2) I have not picked the template to use with the course. I suppose I should be able to choose what template to use for each course, in case I make more, but when adding a certificate to a course I have no options to pick what template to use (maybe because atm I have just one?)

Delete all the seals and copy all the images from the signature folder into the seals folder. In the certificate.php-file for your types you might have to change the dimensions of the print_seal-command to those that are used for the print_signature-command. In the language file I changed the strings for signature into \"left signature\" and for seals into \"right signature\". In my company both signature sets are the same. Of course it is possible to have two separate or overlaping groups of signatures (e.g. your bosses on the left and you and your fellow teachers on the right).",

A part the fact that \"en\" was \"en_utf8\" before, contrary to what you are saying the path is exactly the same in all Moodle version and if youy have not customized your certifiacte module there is no string elsewhere. Also the docs are a wiki and were mostly contributed by users like you and me. So when you find something wrong or confusing, you can edit the page. To customize your certificate, you have 2 places you can edit : in the above file mod/certificate/lang/en/certificate.php, you can edit a string to replace an existing string by an other one. Very important note : In moodle all strings are cached, so you need to clear all caches (Administration -> Development -> clear caches) or you won't see any effect of your changes ! if you use a type of certificate named \"my_certificate\" you can edit the file mod/certificate/type/my_certificate/certificate.php The advantage of this second method is that you can not only change existing texts, but also add lines of code like certificate_print_text($pdf, $myx, $myy, 'C', 'freeserif', '', 20, \"My text\"); where $myx and $myy being the coordinates in mm where you want the text to appear. You can also change font, font size, style, ... But the disadvantage of this second method is that you can only put text in one language so for multilanguage site the first method is most suited.",

          "Text": "I am sorry if this has been discussed before, but I couldn't find any relevant information using the site search. Looking at TCPDF website , one can easily make out that vector graphics is possible with TCPDF; however, the certificate activity is a bit limited in this area. I was able to use vector graphics directly into the certificate, and it works beautifully. No matter how big the certificate is scaled, it would retain its resolution. The problem is that the image upload option within moodle's certificate activity settings does not accept .svg file types. It is currently limited to .jpg and .png. This makes it difficult for course developers who are not admin users to change the graphics on the certificate as and when required. It would be great if the option to use .svg graphics is added to the certificate activity. The code would remain the same; however the image won't stretch, it will re-scale. This is an example of the code I have used to have a vector graphic background (border image) for my certificate: (the file I have edited is \\mod\\certificate\\type\\A4_non_embedded\\certificate.php) \n```text\n$pdf->ImageSVG($file='Certificate01.svg', $brdrx, $brdry, $brdrw, $brdrh, $link='', $align='', $palign='', $border=0, $fitonpage=false);\n```\n Note that the Certificate01.svg file in this instance is placed at /mod/certificate/",

The problem is that Learner Names are in a mix of languages - mainly English, Thai, Burmese, and Khmer - but the Name field only allows assigning a single font. The certificate has been set up to use the 'Free' font family as suggested under the heading \"Languages with special characters\" on the documentation page . However, some names (Thai ones in particular) do not display correctly. Thai is a tonal language and it require two levels of tone marks above the text. As far as I can see, the \"Free\" font family does not support this (I think it only supports one level of diacritical mark above the text) and I don't think it explicitly supports Thai. So my questions is: 1. Is it possible to conditionally set the font for the name field in the certificate based on the user's preferred language? 2. If not, does anyone know of a font face that has glyphs for English, Thai, Burmese, and Khmer?",

If no second parameter is given, the normal format for your locale is used (\"Friday, the 4th ...\"). You can override the format by adding a format string as a parameter: $date = userdate($user->certdate, \"%m/%d/%Y, %Hh:%Mm\"); I'm not sure what kind of quotes are right here. Check http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for possible format code characters Another hint: Look for a line beginning with $ sql sort $sqlsort = 's.certdate ASC'; sorts the certificate by date",

As you will see here it is possible to use the tcpdf Image method with an image content rather than an adress.

Second, we're running Moodle 1.9.2 and have installed the certificate module for 1.9. If we don't link any activities the student can go right to the certificate and print it out as if s/he has completed the course. If we lock it with a required course grade, it goes into a loop stating that the user must first take the course before s/he can print out a certificate. This is the message we receive: \"Your current course grade (-%) is below the grade required ('X'%) to receive your certificate.\" 'X' represents whatever value we require. The student is returned to the course when s/he clicks Continue. We get this message even if the student has successfully completed the course with a grade equal to or higher than the required grade. The same thing happens if we include linked activities and the same thing happens if we turn off required course grade and leave linked activities on. At first, I thought it might be that the system had to wait for the cron to run but it's been happening for a couple of hours now so it's safe to say that's not it.... Any ideas what may be happening? Thank you, Mike",

          "Text": "Hi, I have something very mysterious that happened with CustomCert. And although it happened only once, and it may not happen again, I need to know what happened to ensure it will not happen in the future, as it caused a lot of confusion. I have done my best to figure out what happened from the front-end. In short, we upgraded Moodle. 1. Before the upgrade we were using LegacyCert. and were using Grades as a completion condition to receiving the certificate. 2. On July 6th, 2019 I added CustomCert for all students who have not yet received a Legacy Cert, so that the certificate they will be receiving from now on is a CustomCert not the LegacyCert, and removed access to generating a LegacyCert from all of these courses. 3. For many of these courses I continued to use grades as the completion condition for receiving the CustomCert. (For others I used the CourseCompletion as a completion condition for CustomCert, but that is not relevant here). 4. On July 11th, without the students logging in and without the students clicking to receive a Custom Cert CustomCert automatically issued a certificate to any user w ho was enrolled in a course that was using Grade Completion requirements and who had previously completed the grades completion requirement and received a Legacy Cert. It did not issue the certificates when the certificate was created (which might have made more sense), it issued them on a random date of July 11th. 5. What resulted was that any student who had already completed the course and received a Legacy Cert, was then issued a Custom Cert on July 11th. (The main issue we had with this, was not the student's receiving two certificates, but that certiticate completions are logged in Config. Reports and we then had duplicate records which caused a lot of problems...) 6. I understand that CustomCert does not \"Issue\" a certificate unless the student clicks on the \"View Certificate\" link. So I want to understand why it automatically issued certificates here. In short the main issue here is that CustomCert automatically issued certificates for student's who had completed its grade completion requirements, but had not clicked to \"View Certificate.\" And it also did so on a seemingly random date without student log-in to trigger such an action. Assistance on this issue would be appreciated. Thanks!",

I think that the behavior of emailing certificates is fundamentally different between the two plugins. The old mod_certificate would not email a certificate until the user clicked the View certificate button. The customcert plugin, meanwhile, seems to email certificates immediately when it sees that the conditions are met (it does not wait for the student to click the button). Therefore, when I recently added the customcert module to a bunch of my courses that were previously using mod_certificate, all of the users who had a grade which met the condition for the certificate, were emailed a copy of the customcert. Thousands of people, all in the duration of a few minutes. Well, the \"issue\" event happened that quickly. It took longer for the email queue to clear out. Anyway, that is my experience, which maybe won't alleviate your overall concern, but hopefully makes it seem less random. - Ray",

On your non-Moodle website are you linking directly to the certificate (ie. <yoursite>/mod/certificate/view.php?id=XYZ)? It seems odd that you would receive a 404 error. It would either tell you that you had to log in, that you did not meet the requirements or provide some semi-useful information. Linking directly to the certificate will still require a Moodle login to access the course in the first place. Also, the fact you are receiving a 404 error leads me to believe that something else is wrong. Do you have access to your apache error logs so I can get a more detailed error message?",

My moodle site is at learn.crosswindpm.com (which is actually at crosswindpm.com/learn). That is where I am attempting the certificate functionality. When I attempt to run the cert functionality, it ends up giving me a 404 error at crosswindpm.com. I have tested this with a small course that has two tests with five questions each. I have accessed these tests with my admin account and an enrolled user account I created. Also, on google chrome and safari. Similar results. When doing these tests, they shows checks in both tests when done. Still the 404. I have access to the apache error logs, assuming they are accessible via cpanel.

It shows a blank screen for both of them after I press the print certificate button. However, it does print a certificate and I can access it only as an administrator.Once I remove the SSL certificate they both go back to working normally.

Both sites are using Moodle 2.4.1 (Build: 20130114), though the two sites are on different hosts.  This is not a big issue as the transparent images work fine on the site I want them to work on, while on the development site they don't.  Would anyone have an explanation for why the transparent images won't load?

I have attempted to turn on and off the \"use email certificate ad-hoc task\" to see if that would change it, but it still is not working.

I'm using a 1.9.4 install with the latest Certificate and Certificate Report modules. What I want to do is create a role which gives selected users of a specific course the ability to see the list of course completion certificates issued to all the students within that course. So these users are kind of like mini course admins, but they can't see any other courses other than the course they are enrolled on, and ideally, only the users in the group they are assigned to. If I log in as the main Admin, I can see the certificates that have been issued to myself, and via a \"view issued certificates\" link on the top right of the page, I can see all the other certificates issued to students on the course. But I don't want to give this custom role full admin rights, just the ability to see all the issued certificates for that specific course. But when I set up a custom role with all the certificate capabilities switched on, and apply it to a test student account, I only seem to be able to see the certificates issued to that student user and I don't get the \"view issued certificates\" link. Is this possible, or is is something which can only be applied in system context? Any help gratefully received before I pull any more of my hair out. thanks,",

Student completes test (quiz) and receives automated advice from Moodle at the time of submission to allow 2-3 business days for the test (quiz) to be graded. Once graded, the teacher generates an email to the student by clicking on the student's name in Result - Overview We use Microsoft Outlook with the Insert - Signature feature, this email alerts the student to check their results, feedback and provides a screen shot example on how to retrieve their certificate. If all your courses are automated, then I can only suggest that you advise the student to check their results and download their certificate along with any other advice at the time they attempt the quiz and again after they submit thier quiz. Any notation can be inserted by editing the relevant quiz.

I have a two-part question concerning certificates if anyone could please help. My company is putting together some courses on Moodle and we want to customise the certificates we give to people so that they have our company's branding. I've uploaded an image that we would like to use as the watermark. I see that you can upload different images for the watermark, border, signature, stamp, seal etc. Do these images form a template certificate? And then the student's name and the name of the course completed is pasted over the top? Also we have only just started putting together our first course, it's a while off being completed. Is there a way that we can generate certificates to see what they look like? I just want to play around with our certificates so I can get them looking the way we want but I can't see a way to do that in the options of the certificate plugin? Can certificates only be edited once a course has been put together? Thank you.",

Is there a way I can edit this code, or set up a certificate that has this functionality at all? bonus points if instructions are in very simple terms as I am not very confident with moodle or codes yet...

The first one is tha there is a new capability that must be added for all the modules. This is called \"addinstance\" and in the module is not found. For fixing this is necessary to change the /db/access.php file and add in the end of the array: \n```text\n'mod/certificate:addinstance' => array(\n\n\n        'captype' => 'read',\n\n\n        'contextlevel' => CONTEXT_MODULE,\n\n\n        'archetypes' => array(\n\n\n                'teacher' => CAP_ALLOW,\n\n\n                'editingteacher' => CAP_ALLOW,\n\n\n                'manager' => CAP_ALLOW\n\n\n        )\n\n\n ),\n```\n I will take a look on the module behaviour on this week. If I find something else I will post it. Cheers",

So i downloaded mod_certificate 2012070201 and i would like to upgrade the activity module.

The files in the mod/certificate folder do not contain the information about who has received the certificate, what the conditions are etc, that is stored in the database. So deleting this folder does not uninstall the certificate module. The folder simply contains the code that determines how the certificate behaves. You can also place pictures here, and edit the certificate types, which change how the certificate appears, but if you have not altered the default types and images then you will not lose any vital information. There is a file mod/certificate/db/upgrade.php that contains a set of instructions on what to do during the upgrade of certificates. When you replace the mod/certificate folder with the new version, this file will be updated and perform the necessary database changes to work with the new code. Regards, Mark",

The other issues you will have are with any database calls, as 2.0 introduced the global object $DB which handles database functions. Certificate function names have also changed, eg. cert_printtext is now certificate_print_text. If you compare the custom certificate types you may have more luck in fixing these issues. Just take it step by step and remove the error messages as they appear. It may be quicker re-doing the custom certificate types (if that's an option for you). If it's simply images that you have moved around, then you could just copy one of the core certificate types and then add the images to that, and use the same x and y coordinates that are in your custom cert.

It should put an equivalent numeric date with the formatting you applied in column F copy the formula down all cells in coumn f do a custom sort by column F PS - if you to want the column to have the actual numeric date values instead of a formula,  just copy the column of formula values and do a Paste Special / Values into a blank column then you can delete the text and formula columns This post also has code changes you can make if this is an option for you: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=152938",

          "Text": "Hi @Zbigniew, I have completed this feature privately with the intention to have this merged back into the plugin asap. I also created a new certificate issue workflow where certificates can be issued on course completion. And, as well as the option of emailing student, teacher or another, I can simply create and save certificate PDFs to the Moodle filesystem. I am also near completion of improving certificate file renaming using group, course & student name as the current naming, based on template name, is not sufficient. I have also included the option to download a zip of certificate PDFs for selected users–using the existing admin page–most importantly for me, offering the option to select one or more groups and download certificates for just those users. It quickly became obvious that sequential numbering should have some management logic. This utilised multiple new database entries and a new admin settings page to allow for a history/audit of previously defined certificate start numbers. This allows manual certificates to be issued outside of Moodle or for an interruption/skip of any given number sequence. I combined this with a new certificate element to display the sequential code, with padding (using prefixed zeros as desired) and a chosen prefix text. However; In the last 6 months I've been very active with development of this and also a heavy user and implementer of some other Moodle plugins . During this time I have asked many questions of plugin maintainers,  I've also had reason to post bugs or queries to the Moodle issue tracker after following documentation produced unexpected or simply incorrect behaviour. I'm very sad to report that I've not received a single response in this time. This is true even for plugins where I can see they are being very actively maintained with multiple daily commits from multiple people with multiple merges. I've even emailed maintainers directly and still not received any replies. For this reason I'm losing all faith in the Moodle community. The lack of communication is deafening, and has resulted in one of my clients deciding to choose an alternative LMS solution. For this reason I have yet to decide whether to give my hard work back to a disinterested community.  I'd be interested to hear which environment you are using Moodle for: Education/Commercial training etc? kind regards",

The features you’ve developed sound incredibly useful, particularly the sequential numbering management and improved certificate workflow. I completely understand your frustration with the lack of engagement from plugin maintainers. It’s disappointing when valuable contributions don’t get the attention they deserve. Regarding your question—I’m a research and teaching staff member at Jan Długosz University in Częstochowa, a public university in Poland. I also serve as the director of our Distance Learning Center and manage our Moodle systems. We operate two Moodle platforms—one primarily for teaching purposes and another dedicated to mandatory and supplementary training for our staff and educators. These include periodic health and safety training, accessible document editing, and personal data protection courses, among others. We actively use the Custom Certificate plugin on both platforms, though currently, it plays a key role in generating completion certificates for staff training courses. Additionally, we are in the process of implementing a micro-credentials system in various Moodle courses, where certificates will also be essential. Implementing sequential numbering is a critical and urgent requirement for us. Would you consider sharing your solution, even in a test phase? We’d be happy to provide feedback and explore how it integrates into our system. Best regards, Zbyszek",

However, I could release a beta version of the certificate issue workflow which uses course name and username for certificate PDF filename. Custom Certificate really has no Grups support so including group options is slightly more complex, but a minimum requirement for me. I have no interest in attention for these efforts. My hope for custom certificate communication was to discuss some of the design decisions that I was making which could affect other planned/expected developments or any known roadmap. In particular where my changes interact closely with existing features I had/have questions which I hoped would ensure I was most sympathetic with the existing features or indeed any roadmap the maintainers might have in mind. Put simply I didn't want to build features in isolation without first having the opportunity to hear the opinions from any of the key maintainers. Without this communication, and without any official visibility of what development the community might be doing, it is entirely possible for you and I or others to be developing the exact same features without each other being aware. This seems like madness and totally avoidable. Maybe better communication should be a minimum standard for a plugin to be considered actively maintained? At the moment Moodle and Mood Partners appear to be focussing on Moodle Workplace and Moodle LMS is really being forgotten. Please stay in touch and I will do my best to make my sequential numbering available asap. kind regards Rick",

What I do know is that previously I could set a minimum number of minutes a student needed to be in the course. This was solid, reliable and varifiable for the course evaluators that I must satisfy. The conditional activities are linked to Allow access dates and grade conditions and those are ok for some situations. What about database entries, completely watching a video, visiting and reading a web page, or completeing a form, these are some activities that could be conditional to successfully completing a course too. Perhaps if some of these activities were part of the conditional activites, I could manage the students progression through the course better. I'm sorry, but I can't see how conditional activites can replace the minimum number of minutes setting that was deleted in Moodle 2.0 for my particular distance learning courses. These courses are regulated activities with requirements set in law and regulation. Its not uncommon to have credit or certificate requirements based on a time standard along with the curriculum requirement. Our college courses are set to 50 minutes per class. Our high school classes are set to be 45 minutes long, and in each case a student must attend a minumum number of classes to get credit.  I can't change the environment in which I teach. I am hoping that this function can be added or a replacement for it found. What do think? Ron",

Basically, in 1.9 there was a table in the database called 'certificate_linked_modules' that linked the certificate with certain modules (eg. a quiz) and contained a grade value that must be met before the certificate could be accessed. In Moodle 2.0 conditional activities were introduced as a part of the core code, so this table was not needed and any logic in the code using this table was deleted. After you informed me that the setting for 'minimum number of minutes' was missing from the certificate settings in Moodle 2.0 I compared the code from 2.0 and 1.9 and noticed that these settings were stored in the 'certificate_linked_modules' table. However, instead of listing a valid module id (linkid is the fieldname that stored this value), it would set the value to '-1' which indicated that it was not linked to a module, but to the number of minutes in a course. I will have to re-write the code to re-introduce this setting so that it does not use the table 'certificate_linked_modules', which is not in use any longer. The tracker link I provided is to remind me that there is a request for this to be done at some stage. However, I have a lot that I want to change with the certificate module so can not provide you with an exact time this will be completed.",

What is of most interest is whether this function can tabulate cumulative time across multiple logins; e.g., a student who does part of a course one day, shuts down his computer, then logs in and completes the course the next day.  When you say that it \"adds up the difference in time for each activity for a single login,\" I infer that it does not accumulate time for prior logins, and that the time that is added up starts with the most recent login.",

So In your case if the student does part of a course one day, shut his computer and log and complete the course next day the time of the first session would be from his first login to his latest action this day no more. But you need to be aware of the way the calculation is done because if for instance session timeout is set to 1 hour on your Moodle website, and if a student login, do some action in the course, shut his computer, then login again 45 minutes later and do some action, he will be considered as having spend 45 minutes in course because all actions will be considered as part of the same session. Unfortunately I see no way to avoid that.",

Specifically, we would like to print the names of each activity in the course that the user has a passing grade for, but otherwise leave that field blank if the user did not pass. Additionally, is there a way to utilize Outcomes to group multiple activities into one item? We would like to just print the group name of the Outcome on the certificate if all of the activities in that set have been passed. We are trying to automate a certificate generation process that we have been doing manually for years now... These certificates need to be modular - only showing the activities and groups of activities in the course that were completed by the user. Thanks for any input! Ryan",

Just to be clear: you go to your course.  Before you uninstalled the certificate, it had a certificate in it.  And after you uninstalled and reinstalled the certificate module,  the certificate is no longer there.  Is this correct? I have a this idea that there is another My SQL database table involved that you did not backup, thus it does not have a record that a certificate is there.  I bet if you had the My Certificate block (report) installed, it might show the certificates to the administrator. I do know know what happens to certificates that maybe stored in /moodledata in each course folder, when certificate is uninstalled. If it was me, I would create a localhost and install certificate, create a course and add a certificate.  Have a student receive a certificate.   Then look at the MySQL tables and moodledata.   Finally, uninstall and reinstall certificate and see what didn't happen. I suspect that Moodle code picks up on the fact that Certificate has been installed.  When you add a certificate to a course, it add a record to one of the course MySQL tables which has a field that points to a record in a certificate table.   Maybe that link is no long valid, or uninstalling certificate automatically deletes the link. Hope somebody else steps in.   Chris",

Look at MoodleDocs here . It has fields for date of issue, and signature.  Read MoodleDocs on how to customize a certificate here . Was is the \"content of course\" data?  Do you mean the course description? While anything is possible in Moodle, some of what you want probably means altering the php code in places not mentioned in the documentation. I think creating the string that contains the course description or custom user_fields might be another complicated thing to do that needs someone with PHP skills and knowledge of the Certificate code. Hope this helps you get started, Chris",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, We are using Moodle 3.5 and Custom Certificate plugin in some courses. The plugin is configured to email students the PDF certificate file as soon as the course feedback activity is completed (which requires the student to have passed the test activity before that). The entire system works well and the certificates are generated. The certificate is also emailed to a common email ID which acts like a central register of certificates. However, we see that some certificates are not being emailed out. For example, we have a course where 131 students completed the feedback activity but only 77 were received in the common email ID. When we check the sent folder of the email box being used to send emails, we see some user certificates were not mailed out at all. I understand that each time the certificate schedule task runs which is set to 10 min, it picks up those students who have completed the criterion and who have not been sent emails before. But in this case it is not picking up all the students. Some are being left out. Does anyone have any idea about this pls? Thanks!",

That is, either click the Run Now button in the Scheduled tasks page, or run it from the command line. - Do you know if the email failures are intermittent? Or did they completely stop at a particular time, and no emails have been sent since that time? If you have access to your database , you could look in the customcert_issues table to see if you notice any pattern about what certificates have not been emailed. Good luck!",

If you aren't familiar with SQL I would like to put a note of caution - whenever you're messing with the database directly, it's better to backup the database first - that way you can restore it if you accidently break anything.",

I have no graphical elements to change, as I've incorporated them all into the background image, and that's working fine. I need to adjust the text to be left aligned, and change the x and y co-ordinates for the text positions. I've managed the left alignment, but for the life of me I can't figure out what the coordinate units are - can anyone enlighten me? I assumed it was pixels, with a 0,0 origin of top left, but it seems definitely not - I laid everything up in illustrator and used the co-ordinates from that for my first try but it all ended up way lower down than I was expecting, and in ways that don't make a lot of sense to me. I was working off an image at 842 x 595 (A4 at 72DPI), so from a pixel point of view it should have been screen accurate. Everything I've seen on other forums, the manual etc just says to adjust the co-ordinates to move the text, but it doesn't say how you work out what they should be except by trial and error...e.g. this is from the manual: \"Changing the location of text is done by using code to set the x,y position on the page. The \"x\" is the distance from the left margin and the \"y\" is the distance from the top. All the certificate type code files start off with defining x,y points for various strings or images.\" Unfortunately, trial and error is not an option for me as we don't manage our site installation directly, so everytime I want to try it I have to email it to a guy and he uploads it. I need to be able to work it out with more precision! Many thanks Nicola",

This information includes certificates from completed courses, grades, students, etc. This information is for quarterly reporting etc. We want to specify how many hours training is awarded per coruse. E.g. the security course is 2 hours long, and so when the certificate is awarded at its completion, moodle will report to the database that this user has completed 2 hours training (even if they were logged into the course for 1 hour or 5 hours - as long as they successfully complete the quiz which allows them to get the certificate then it will be said they have completed 2 hours training). We will then be able to add up the number of hours people have spent on courses. This information must be sent to the database, because thats where we are pulling it from. as mentioned in my first para, we are already able to report on coruses, students, certificates issued etc etc. We just need a plugin that will allow us to specify how amny hours is spent on a certain course. The amount of hours would be specified by the admins when they set up the coruse, and has no correlation to how long the user was actually in the course for in real time. I hope I havent confused you. Thanks. Che",

Sounds like the first step is to figure out how to determine the number of credits each course it worth and how to add that to the database. I would start with modifying the course settings page (../course/edit.php), add a new filed in the database and a new \"Credit Hours\" input filed on the course settings page. Once you have the number of credits that a course is worth in the database it's fairly simple to get it to print on the certificate.

We are currently using an older version of the plugin (4.1.1, moodle 4.1) and would like to update. I have tested this in our development environment. This resulted in a bunch of certificates being sent to admin users from courses they had not attended (as our test users in dev moodle do not have real email addresses, I cannot be 100% sure if they would have received emails as well). I am pretty sure that this has something to do with the settings of our dev moodle (e.g. the cron jobs were started only a few hours before the plugin update). However, it is really important to us that certificates are not sent to people who have not earned them. So I was wondering if anyone knew how to make sure that no emails are sent after I update the plugin in our production Moodle. I tried disabling email notifications (/admin/message.php) but the new certificates are still being sent. Then I set Email diverting -> Divert all emails (/admin/settings.php?section=outgoingmailconfig) and this at least worked in my test so that new certificates were redirected to my specified email.

Our main issue currently however is to bulk resend (email) the certificates to students after it has been issued.  We sometimes issue certificates to students who are not online learners (i.e. we register them because they attend classroom training, but they never actually log onto the platform).  Sometimes it happens that the emails didn't go through or the trainer forgot to 'check' email students when they created the custom certificate.  When this happens we have to manually download them one by one (and we are talking 20 - 30 certificates at a time) and then email them manually. Is there a way to work around this? Not sure if it is worth mentioning that we always use bulk registrations/enrolments.",

However, it does not update with 4.0 in the manner that this plugin did for previous updates (i.e., 3.xx.x) where the plugin was automatically included when updating to the newer Moodle version. I updated to Moodle version 4.0 but the plugin was not included, so I assumed it would not work with 3.11. With your message, I went back to Site Administration > Plugins overview > Custom certificate and there was a link there to upgrade to 3.11. I performed the upgrade to 3.11 and the certificate plugin was upgraded. At this point, it appears to be working fine. Thanks for checking into this. Dan",

Although I'm sure that the tutorial is very helpful, I am lost trying to follow it. I have a trutype font that I downloaded, but I do not know how to run the ttf2ufm utility. I also do not know how to run the makefont.php script. The utility folder was not in my version of Moodle, but I managed to download a version that had the utility folder in it. I'm afraid that I need a \"create tcpdf fonts for dummies\" tutorial that will start me from \"square 1\" If anybody has a link they could point me to, it would be great. Thanks so much.",

It looks like the grade center took the 100% for course and 95% for quiz and divided by 2 for the 97.5%.

Assume you  are playing around with customizing the certificate files. I am a little rusty but here are some ideas.  Users can have more than one role and/or you can change roles for specific users in specific activities .   What about creating an activity that is graded by a master teacher.  The grade could be the number of students in the teacher's group.  Set the condition for the teacher's certificate to get more than 1 in the activity.     If you are clever enough to insert the number of people in the group the teacher manages, don't display the grade field but the  group count field. I am looking at upgrading Moodle from 2.2 to 2.9 so have returned here after a long absence. Hope this helps - Chris",

If you have linked it to the quiz being completed, try instead to set the minimum score  to 0 or 1, see if that works.   Check to see if you have also linked your certificate to an activity where you failed to set the standards for completion in that activity. Since gradebook sees the scores/completions, I suspect you missed something in the certificate settings. Cron was a good thought and I have experienced that issue on a new site.

The student participates in several activities throughout the course (some activities are outside of Moodle, although the instructions for these are in Moodle). Once all activities are completed they should get a certificate, but the teacher needs to verify that the students have actually done all of the activities (again some are outside of Moodle) before they can get the certificate. We have tossed up emailing them an activity checklist that is eventually signed off by the facilitator, which they then upload and once they have completed this step, they can access the certificate. But none of the Moodle activities would work like this apart from posting a forum discussion thread & attaching their file (most activities require a view of the activity or a grade prior to marking it complete, the forum can be marked completed upon one posting a new discussion). The later is not ideal (just a dirty workaround) as it has privacy issues for participants where they can see who has uploaded their verified checklists. The only solution we can find is to create a seperate course for the certificate and entry to this course is only permitted upon completion of the first course, markign the first course complete would be a manual process for the teacher. Surely there is an easier way?",

Basically we have a list of 8 \"offline activities,\" and the trainer need to go in to \"sign off\" each participants in the gradebook. However, with Moodle (2.5.x)'s \" activity completion \" feature, even after the trainer gave the participant a grade (in the gradebook), the participant still need to login and \"checK\" on the checkboxes of each \"offline activity\" (that is, by assigning a passing grade in the gradebook for that \"offline activity\" will NOT automatically \"check off\" the activity completion checkbox). Is there a better and more streamlined way to implement this? Thanks!",

I am the site administrator, but I would like to allow our Registrar and Department Heads (all roles defined in our system) the ability to create / modify templates. How do I do that? I can see in some documentation a Custom Certification Administration block which may allow management of permissions, but that block does not appear on my system after plugin installation. Do I need to do something to make that block appear so I can use it to manage permissions for this capability? Please advise.",

Here is the process we used in case anyone else wants to do the same. 1, Go to the course in question, and \"export\" the gradebook with names of enrolled users and the activities where you want to enter grades (in our case, this was the final exam empty fields). 2. Open up the exported file in Excel and bulk enter a passing grade for all the users in the final exam (we used 100%); save as a CSV file. 3. Import the gradebook file back into Moodle, making sure you map the fields correctly. 4. Temporarily delete ALL of the restrictions on the Certificate; new certificates should then be automatically generated for each user with the new data (you may have to purge cache); if you have checked the option to e-mail certificates, they will be immediately sent out. 5. Re-enter the restrictions back on the Certificate so that all new users on Moodle will now have to meet the requirements to get their certificate.",
