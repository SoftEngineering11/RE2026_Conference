It is however, more challenging and completely manually when there are large training audiences. I prepared a course that required SME review and feedback prior to release. The course has 55 different cohorts, two of which were the SMEs cohorts. I marked the other cohorts as hidden until the SMEs blessed the course's content for release. To unhide each of the cohorts was a complete maddening experience. One at a time and the screen bounced back to the top of the page. No Select All or Unhide All functionality. No letting the admin self-navigate in a very, long page (death scroll). No filters to quickly check that all cohorts were unhidden.",

This one single, student has 106 competencies. Adding each competency is an extremely manual process, but worse than that the Learning plan Template view has no automated ordering capabilities. None. Each competency has to be moved, manually using a UI that looks for like a DOS screen than a modern UI. Just having some method for automated ordering would save me hours every week.",

This requires global configuration changes or moving the course to hidden categories, which is cumbersome for teachers. Proposed Improvement Add an \"Show on front page\" option in the course settings with: Yes : Course appears on the front page for users with permission . No : Course is visible only to enrolled users and does not appear on the front page. Site default : Follows global site settings.",

The ability to reset course completion without deleting existing completions would be so valuable and would save hours of work to create new courses and enable completion reports to be run on the same course.

Sometimes, the behavior of images can vary depending on the selected theme, as each one may have its own settings and specific dimensions. Additionally, could you share a screenshot of the areas where you notice these differences? This will help us better understand what's happening and find a more targeted solution. Sometimes, the theme's CSS can be adjusted to harmonize proportions and avoid these visual inconsistencies. Eduardo Kraus Teacher and programmer",
