(The limitation is: pmatch has the option to work with ousupsub. If you use that option, then the question won't work in the mobile app. If you avoid that option, then it should work. Probably. We have written the code, but we are not acutally using it yet ourselves, so it may not have been tested properly.) Pattern Match with Molecular Editor. Not supported. Probably going to be the last question type we try to add support for. Getting the molecular edtor to work on the mobile app is probably goinig to be a major challenge.

However I have been having difficulties making this work well because I suspect the timestamp should be localised by the app and not in Moodle, I have not been able to work out a way to do this in the templates yet. So for example the string in Moodle is something like: \n```text\n$string['strwithdate'] = 'On {$a->date} something will happen';\n```\n The data passed to the app includes a value for the date as a Unix timestamp (so it can be localised to a date in the app). In the template I can render the string using the raw timestamp by doing something like this: \n```text\n{{ 'plugin.mod_myplugin.strwithdate' | translate: { $a: { date: <% timestamp %> } } }}\n```\n I can also display the date localised date using: \n```text\n{{ <% timestamp %> | coreToLocaleString }}\n```\n or \n```text\n{{ '<% timestamp %>000' | coreFormatDate: \"dffulldate\" }}\n```\n but I have been unable to find a way to get the app to pass a localised version of the timestamp into the string. Is it possible or is this something I'm only going to be able to do by passing some additional JavaScript to the App from my Moodle plugin?",

Is \"course download\" supposed to automatically download the core-files? If yes do you have a code example? Thank you, Jerome",

Access to a site is just not Device -> Site ... there are other routers/switches, etc. in between - in network terms 'hops'.   Normally. if the number of hops is over 30 ... issues.   Packets never return to the device requesting access/interaction.

As an example, let's say that this activity points to www.google.com . If you use MM app to navigate to that resource and open it, a system browser will be opened with www.google.com . I guess you also added an image with an URL of the kind: \" http://mymoodle.net/mod/url/view.php?id=4 \". If you click that image in the app you see the Moodle login form and, after authenticating, you end up in the Moodle URL page where there's a link to www.google.com . What do you want to achieve? Do you want that clicking the image opens www.google.com directly? Or do you want that opening the URL resource sends you to the Moodle URL page like the image do? If you want that opening the Moodle URL resource in the app (open directly www.google.com ) is recorded in the Moodle logs and the activity completion, then you should install the Moodle Mobile Additional Features plugin. If you have that plugin installed, then opening that URL using the app should have the same behavior as opening in Moodle web: a log entry will be added and the URL should be marked as completed if it's configured as \" Student must view this activity to complete it \".

Most will use the image.  When either is clicked I want a pop-up window (I know how to do this) to display. At the moment clicking the image does not work, i.e,. redirects me to the login, whereas clicking the text based link to the url does. I guess I should have mentioned this but I assumed this was base functionality with the test theme (Essentials) I am using. I.e., the Moodle Mobile Additional Features plugin appears to be there and fails if I try to install it.  There is a big warning not to use the theme in production but this is NOT a production system, yet.",

          "Text": "Hi Sanat, your plugin's Javascript code should have access to a service named CoreDomUtilsProvider , and that service has some helper function for modals. E.g. in here you can see a function that the app usually uses to display an error message. You can also interact with the Ionic services directly: AlertController, LoadingController, PopoverController, ... As for the redirect, you can use the following line to send the user to the Dashboard: \n```text\nthis.CoreLoginHelperProvider.redirect('CoreCoursesDashboardPage');\n```\n This line will do the following: If the user is in a tab that isn't the Dashboard tab, the Dashboard tab will be selected and the Dashboard will be reloaded. If the user is in the Dashboard tab, a confirm message will be displayed asking the user if he wants to go back to Dashboard. If he confirms, he'll go back to the Dashboard. If you don't want the confirm to be displayed, please try this (I haven't tested it though): \n```text\nif (this.NavController && this.NavController.root == '\nCoreCoursesDashboardPage') {\n\n\n    this.NavController.goToRoot();\n\n\n} else {\n\n\n    \nthis.CoreLoginHelperProvider.redirect('CoreCoursesDashboardPage');\n\n\n}\n```\n Cheers, Dani",

If I click on a course and then select content, it redirects to the website's login screen which I would expect to see if I used Firefox , Safari, etc.\n\nI don't get why AFTER ALREADY AUTHENTICATING a user has to see a web login screen and do the whole thing over again.\n\nI think I'm missing something critical, but the mobile documentation is convoluted if you get beyond \"just enable mobile services.\"\n\nCan anyone enlighten me as to what needs to be done so that a SECOND login is not required?\n\nAlso, if I go ahead and put my userid/pw in the website screen which comes up, it basically takes me to the website. I have to then navigate as if I were simply using mobile Safari or Android's browser(s). I thought the purpose of mobile was to present a cleaner \"mobile\" interface. Again, if the first part of this question reveals that the site's mobile isn't set up properly, then there's a chance that the rest won't be working correctly either. I realize that could be the case. Hoping for some help. TIA .",

          "Text": "Hello Cadwell, sorry for my late response. Short answer: Yes, the app forces you to a second login, is a known problem and is in the app roadmap to fix that as soon as possible. Moodle doesn't have a generic SSO mechanism, there are plans for adding a generic SSO mechanism in Moodle 2.9 based on SimpleSAML. Once is done, I will try to add support to it in the app as soon as possible. But it will take at least 6 months (in the best case) Meanwhile, as David Perry suggested. You can installl the local_mobile plugin and force the users to login via the site. The app will open a browser asking your users to login in Moodle and then the app will be reopened again, in this case, the login will be active. Cheers, Juan",

Moodle Mobile will never have the 100% of Moodle features, this will required a big developers team. Moodle Mobile is just a mobile app that may help users to read offline contents and receive notifications. By the way, MyMobile theme doesn't work very well, Moodle HQ is creating a new theme called bootstrap/simple that will be available in Moodle 2.5 that follows a responsive design approach.

But for doing that first we need to package the plugin we are currently using (WebIntent) following some specifications (seems that the guy that originally did the plugin doesn't maintain it https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/commits/master/Android/WebIntent the last commit is mine, fixing a bug I found) So I will fork and package the plugin for submit it to Phonegap Build so we can avoid compiling at all and release new versions directly compiled by Phonegap, I think I can have the work done in a week and the plugin available in Phonegap Build in two weeks For more info: http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/07/16/user-submitted-plugins-announcement-post/ Moodle issues pending https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-29202 (Language file) Testing Tony Blundell from Totara is working in refactoring some parts of the code for adding Unit Testings, there will be some API changes so I prefer wait for integrate these changes and perform some unit tests prior to release a new version. Also David Shaw is going to create new issues in the tracker for discussion about the new enhancements proposed QA We have a new member of the team (Laia Canet from CV&A) that will help us for validating the app previous new release I will update http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_Mobile_Roadmap asap",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm developing Mobile app add on that communicates with custom local plugin in Moodle 2.6. One scenario of use I need to cover is to provide some personalized interventions based on certain user action. For example, when user visit some page, several sub-plugins in the Moodle web application will be triggered, and some of them might provide certain intervention such as warning, recommendation, etc. The problem is in that these sub-plugins are to be developed based on machine learning algorithms, and sometimes it might take some time for processing, so user might have a warning produced immediately, and recommendation might be produced 30 seconds later, or he might have no intervention. I thought that pushing this interventions from Moodle web application to Mobile device might  be more efficient then having a poll that will check in frequent intervals if there is some intervention for user to be displayed. At least, there will be no delays in providing feedback. However, I've never used push notifications and I'm not sure if it could be used in this way, and if it is the best solution for my scenario. The other thing is that I don't want users to have to enable push notifications in order to make it work. It should always work. I would appreciate any advice on this issue. Thanks, Zoran",

My understanding is that I need Airnotifier for Android too, but I can use Moodle public Airnotifier server.

The default way to embed videos in Moodle works because it's just an HTML5 player, with no Javascript. In case of Youtube videos, they work because they are inside an iframe, the main problem of this solution is that the video will only be seen if the user is online. The video players should always rely on a HTML5 video player so if the JS isn't run the video will still be seen. Cheers, Dani",

There you can add edit and include new strings on any language. Also you can run the scripts create_langindex.sh and update_lang.sh from the scripts directory. The first one will help you provide where the new strings are placed in the translations directory (Amos) and will auto-edit langindex.json. You'll find more info here: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Translating_the_Moodle_app The second will update and add new languages to the app based on the number of translations (check the translating the Moodle app wiki page). It admits a lang code parameter to force building in a language and it will import new strings onto it. Consider that those scripts clone the translations git repository onto $LANGFOLDER, edit functions.sh to change it. Cheers!",

I am developing a iphone App for an online college that already leverages Moodle. What's the most efficient way to complete the following: From APP authenticate user credentials from moodle site v2.1 after athentication, list courses push notifications from Moodle e.g. Quiz dates, homework due... I'm not asking for you to know Xcode or objective C. I want to to know the best way to export student data to my iphone APP thank you very much. I appreciate your time. 06:50 PM : Please try to post in the forum, so other people can benefit and participate. For authentication: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Creating_a_web_service_client#How_to_get_a_user_token For knowing the available ws functions: Admin > plugins > web services > API Documentation (list of course function exist, push notification doesn't exist yet, no quizz functions too...) The ws roadmap is there: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Web_services_Roadmap Our Moodle app uses XML -RPC protocol. We use the xml-rpc client from wordpress. However if you want great performance, try to use the REST protocol. XML -RPC is by far much more time consuming than SOAP and REST (between 4 to 44 times slower). REST is better than SOAP at the first request (more than twice faster), but SOAP gets closer once it is cached. Note that if iOS support JSON encoding/decoding easily, it would be good to create a fully JSON Moodle REST server . Cheers, Jerome",

One of the advantages of using Ionic (besides being built on AngularJS) is that currently there are plenty documentation and books published about those popular frameworks. If you are using the Custom CSS URL functionality, you will have to upgrade the styles to match the new application; we are also creating documentation with the basic styles you should apply to customize the look and feel of the app. Remember that you can see a static prototype of the new application here: http://prototype.moodle.net/mobile/moodlemobile2/ Regards, Juan",

In Shibboleth we can do that using a curl call to the Apache protected directory. This method will be caled by login/token.php (the login page that uses the mobile app). I don't know if this can be generic, but some config options may be provided: SSO POST url, username field name, password field name, additional fields/params.. and of course, the expected response for success or failure Custom Moodle Mobile plugin. A plugin that obtains a valid user token. It can call a custom WS inside your Moodle installation or another remote WS or similar for getting a valid Moodle token for the user. Custom auth plugin that implements user_authenticated_hook (This method is called from authenticate_user_login() for all enabled auth plugins) so we can inject custom code via this plugin. This is like the previous one but at Moodle side. You have to implement the logic to validate the user and then generate a valid Moodle token for the user. You can't work in the late one and build your custom auth plugin in Moodle for checking specials \"auths\" coming from the Mobile app (you can check the SERVER URL requested or the Referrer for detect logins coming from the mobile app",

          "Text": "Hi there! We are currently working on our own version of the Moodle Mobile app. I've configured the environment, made the necessary changes in the app's config.json file and got it to run. Everything was running smoothly until the login phase. Then I've got the \"We lost connection; you need to reconnect. Your token is now invalid.\" problem using both a student and admin account. For the admin account I generated a token on the \"Site Administration >> Plugins >> Web services >> Generate token\" area as is stated in the docs and it worked like a charm. For the student account, even though he had all capabilities necessary, the error still persisted. It was just when I went to \"Settings >> My profile settings >> Security keys\" and did a \"Reset\" operation of the key for the \"Moodle mobile web service\" that it started to work. After the reset, the invalid token error stopped altogether. In this case, the user already had a security key. Config steps done: The mobile web services are activated; Enabled the following capabilities for the authenticated user: moodle/webservice:createmobiletoken, moodle/webservice:createtoken, webservice/rest:use, webservice/soap:use, webservice/xmlrpc:use; More info: We have LDAP login, and any login option works (in app, via browser window and via embedded browser); The Moodle Mobile additional features plugin isn't installed, since we have Moodle 3.4; Moodle v3.4; After all of this, I got a few questions: 1. The 'Moodle mobile web service' security key (to use the mobile web service) is generated automatically in the user's first login or the user needs to generate by itself? 2. Is it mandatory for all of our users to reset the key to, only then, successfully login in the app? We sincerely hope to avoid this step, wishing that the token could be reset or generated in the login process, without the need to access the site and do the reset process before accessing on app. 3. If it is mandatory to generate/reset token, is it possible to develop a way to generate/reset token for all users at the same time? We think it will lead to confusion if the users need to do this before logging in the app. We also feel that the user should be able to login without this step.",

          "Text": "Good day! Perhaps someone will tell you whether to waste time ... whether the task is feasible. I am engaged in online training of specialists in construction for certification. Now, Moodle 3.2 is used and landing for sales ( https://podgotovka-att.by ) - about 100 courses, but in the near future I would like to have 150. There is a need to automate some processes (automation of access, paid specialists, etc. ). But that is not the question ... In preparation for each course uses only three elements: a Word document with a list of questions and two quizes. One for learning and consistent study of questions - about 500-1200 questions. The second is for trial testing with 40 random questions. Questions are always changes, given some new, some is dead... I use Google spreadsheets for question bank,  from there generate MoodleXML with a script - all XML ~ 2.2-2.6 MB. Everything doesn’t give me peace of mind how to give users the opportunity to download this huge test for online or offline use in a mobile application while they are enrolled in a course ... studying documentation, if the task seemed unrealizable before, now there’s hope;) json, template, plugin for Moodle Mobile ... and also like everything on ajax ))) something similar is implemented in this plugin - https://moodle.org/plugins/qbehaviour_deferredfeedbackexplain but not quite that. Moodle 3.5.3 is already deployed, I transfer courses ... I am setting up syncing with WordPress ... I am amazed how smart the system works! I love Moodle since version 1.9 and it always seemed that nothing was impossible for this system;) Maybe someone will have some thoughts on this subject ... I will be grateful for any advice. Thanks. Sorry for the bad english.",

I'd suggest you to use this approach (I know is not ideal because it takes more work and it will force you to have the video duplicated but is the only solution I can think of): Install the Mobile app availability plugin: https://moodle.org/plugins/availability_mobileapp Configure the current resource to not be available via Moodle Mobile Add the same resource configured to be available via Moodle Mobile but with the video uploaded to Moodle You'll end having the same resource two times but the user will see one of the other depending on how he is accessing to Moodle. Another possible solution (that I'm not sure if they will work in the app) is add the embed code inside an html file hosted in the server (in a separate directory in the same domain that your Moodle site), and then instead adding the embed code in the resource add an iframe pointing to that file. In this scenario, the app will print the iframe and the video will be played from the server. Using this approach I think Vimeo would accept to play the video. Juan",

Depending on whether the Vimeo embed code is in a file on its own or dropped into an existing Moodle page, can take some CSS and/or JS work to position the video correctly - for example, initially used some existing material that was in a Moodle page and didn't realize the video was displaying correctly - it was there but existing CSS and elements were causing it to seem hidden.

It says that is because of privacy. I went to vimeo and change the privacy settings but It didnt had any effect... We need this app to work for the students and don't know what else to do. 2- When we log in from a computer, from the web page directly we can see the videos on a full screen, but when we try to do the same from a cellphone the full screen button is not available.

This Moodle installation has two languages, English and Swedish. The problem: Whenever Moodle is started in both the mobile or desktop app I get an invalid response error. After activating the debugging I found out that the error is a \"failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND in cordova.js:1\" Further down the log file another error occurs: ﻿ \"Failed to load resource: the server www. .../mobile/check.php:1 responded with a status of 404 (Not found)\" Besides these two errors a number of similar warnings occur: \"Ionic Native: tried calling ...(different things)..., but Cordova is not available. Make sure to a) run in a real device or simulator and b) include cordova.js in your index.html\"  vendor.js I have had this problem for a while. First with Moodle 3.8.0 and php 7.2, now with Moodle 3.8.2 and php 7.4. Searching on Google and the forums I found a similar thread about this problem in Moodle 3.6 where a langugare file was empty. However, I did not find the paths that were mentioned there. Maybe this has changed since 3.6? Further, another artikle wrote about braces in the course names causing similar problems. I have checked this and there were no braces in course names. I would be greateful for some guidance in this. With kind regards Niels",

I start the Airnotifier app by running `sudo pipenv run ./app.py` but 'tornado' is not found (see below). So I ran `python3 -m pip install tornado` and it's been successfully installed. However, the app is not working yet. Any idea on how to proceed?

After I access Moodle site on PC (Windows 11, chromium-based browser) and log in, then close the web browser, shut down the PC and turn it back on, I can still access Moodle site without the need to log in again (as long as the sessiontimeout is not reached). I guess I don't need to log in again because of the MoodleSession cookie. On iPhone (iOS 17, Safari and Chromium-based browsers), after I login and close (\"swipe-up\") the browser, I am required to log in again. If I don't \"swipe-up\" the browser app but just switch to another app, I stay logged in. Is it possible to keep users logged in even after they \"swipe-up\" the browser on iPhone without requiring them to change some cookie settings in the browser app or use the Moodle App?

However, a student came to me today with an iPhone 5C, and it simply would not play embedded files in Moodle using Safari. On his phone, in place of the usual audio player, was a message saying that Safari could not play the audio...  I tried clearing his cache and changing the cookie settings, but nothing changed. I gave up and downloaded Chrome to the student's phone the audio played just fine. The audio also plays fine on my iPhone 5 in Safari, so I don't understand why it will not on his 5C. I checked the user agent readings on both of our iPhones, and they are exactly the same. The only differences I could find were that our providers and firmware versions were different. I have a contract with Softbank (Japan), and his is with Docomo. My firmware is v. 6.02.00, and his is v. 2.18.02. Beyond suggesting students download Chrome to work around this problem, does anybody have any idea what is happening here?",

Load video from data: Not available in IOS With so many problems and bugs this activity is not usable in the app. Do you know these problems? Maybe we are doing something wrong in the activity settings in Web Moodle? But the problems only seem to relate to the app. Most of the problems we're having are when we select the video from the gallery. These problems don`t occure, if we search for an image instead of a video. It would be very nice if someone could help us here. Many thanks in advance.",

Note also that Chrome uses an engagement heuristic that will display the banner only on certain conditions, like interactions with the site, the last time you interacted with it, etc. You can remove the engagement restriction check by disabling this special chrome flag: chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks This was tested by using an Android device without the app installed in a recent chrome version.

Other than that, seeing that you're having issue with the Android build, make sure that you have all the Android dependencies installed. For example, if it was working in 4.0.1 but doesn't work for 4.1-dev it's possible that it's related with MOBILE-4123 , where we updated the targetSdk to API level 31. Maybe you need to download the Android libraries for this API level.",

I record and upload the first one (we'll call it Video A) with no problems. When I try and record/upload another one, Video B, everything looks like it's working properly. I get a \" Success! The file was successfully uploaded \" notification. However, when I go to my private files, in either the app or Moodle proper, the only video there is Video A. There's no sign of Video B. And Video B doesn't overwrite Video A. Now, to upload a new/different video, I need to remove Video A from My Files in Moodle. On Android devices, this doesn't seem to be an issue. Thanks again for your hard work on the app. Our students are really finding it valuable!",

We've got about 10% to 20% on WM10 represented in our classes, but already more than 25% (steady growing) on W10 (tablet/laptop). And still there are no working PUSH-Messages for Moodle on WM10/W10. Under this circumstances I cannot declare this app to standard without leaving to many pupils behind. So far as I can see the IONIC framwork does not seem to make any progress on w10, or does it? What do you think about the projekt \"islandwood\"? Could this be an obvious solution? Regards, Ewald",

TO check and see if anything Moodle related needs an update, you can simply go to your website instance via a browser, log in as admin and then adjust the URL to: your-url-here/admin/index.php. As for the plugins/mods you can navigate to Site Administration > Plugins > Plugins Overview and then click on the \"Check for updates\" button. This should indicate if there are any plugin/mod updates available. Once you start upgrading those another button will be displayed on the bottom of the upgrade page that will update the effected database tables, if there are any. Hope this helps with troubleshooting.",

One of our Moodle clients is planning to start implementing the Moodle Mobile Application as part of their course roll-outs, but they need a few things changed before hand. I'm currently trying to set up a list of things that can and can't be changed and so far it's going very slowly. I understand that the mobile theme can be adjusted and that the non-core activity icons are pulled from the web service, whereas the core icons are pulled from the mobile applications assets directory. I was wondering if anyone knows of or has a list of things that can and can't be changed externally to effect what is seen on the mobile application? I'm currently using ( https://mobileapp.moodledemo.net/ ) to find specific css tags for elements so we know what to set in our custom css theme, but other things like specific wording being displayed on buttons I'm not sure if those are pulled from the web service, or if they are also part of the mobile language pack? Simple example would be the \"Post to Forum\" button. I've gone and adjust the display text on the clients server , but I'm not sure if that text is being pulled through to the app or not. I've restarted Apache and re-logged into the site via the mobile app, but it still displays the same \"Post to Forum\" text. I'm not sure if the mobile display text is cached and hasn't updated with the new changes, thus pulled from the web service language pack or if it's pulled from a mobile language pack without actually seeing the mobile applications code. So in short if there is anyone who knows where I can find an easy way to view the applications code or has a list of things that can and can't be adjusted I would much appreciate the help.",

At first we had an error with a \"Uh Oh! Your organisation installed a plugin that not yet supported\" message when we tried to access to one of these course activities . So I read this documentation to add this support. I managed to display some informations I needed but in some cases I make calls to extern APIs to get these informations to display and for theses calls I used to use the Guzzle library. This works well directly in the plateform and in the view.php file of my module. But in the mobile app theses same functions don't work and I have a \"class GuzzleHttp/Client not found\" error. Maybe I missed something but is there any restrictions about the mobile app to make this kind of call ? Do I need to change my code to do more \"classic\" curl calls ? Thanks for your help. Feel free to ask details if it's not very clear. For information I use the last version of the Moodle mobile app and our platform is in Moodle 3.10. Anthony",

In my plugin I used to use Guzzle to easily call functions which were in another library I added thanks to a local composer file. I have no problem in my browser and the plugin works well but when I tried to test it on the moodle mobile app I encounted the error (probably because of what you say about the app who doesn't include any external lib installed in Moodle). For that I edited my plugin to have two different behiavours in function of if we call it classicly (web, browser) or if we call it via the mobile app. In this case I do not use guzzle and my other library and I do some curl directly on the API. It is a little more complicated because I cannot use existant functions of my library but I think I managed to do what I needed. For information I test the source by using this: \n```text\nif (WS_SERVER) {\n    // Curl calls.\n} else {\n    // Guzzle calls.\n}\n```",

We have a need that I believe is not uncommon. Some of our clients require us to provide information, for various different reasons, about user connection times. We tend to derive approximate results by analysing existing tables and suchlike. The question that we are wrestling with is what to do about offline time on mobile devices. We are wondering whether there will be any sort of logs or any other time-logging data available to us for users on the mobile apps? Any pointers of where I could find anything useful on the subject would be much appreciated. Thanks Daniel",

Also, when you push logs from Mobile app to the server , would I be right in assuming that you'll go through the standard logstore API? If I want to intercept the logs as they arrive on the server then would you advise me to write a logstore plugin? Best regards, Daniel",

It's a shame because the uniquelogin was integrated into the Moodle core because it is a real and clear requirement. Developers of the mobile app must try to recognize this user requirement and given  the common database , try to figure out a way that Uniquelogin is enforced for mobile access also. The imperatives of mobile access is inescapable today, and mobile dev cannot wash their hands off this issue but saying that there is no solution. E lse the browser solution restriction is also negated by this backdoor. I request the dev team to revisit this issue and provide a solution to the community.",

The other subtle advantage is that there are vastly more Android devices in the world so you can be confident that the Moodle App and any plugins will have been used more/tested more on Android.

          "Text": "Solved ! I want to thank Dani of Moodle App team 🤩, and share with you his answer. We only use the script in content rendered by the app, content rendered in an iframe is not treated. That's why it works in Page (the app replaces the original Vimeo link and uses the wsplayer.php script instead), but it's not working for SCORM because the SCORM content is rendered in an iframe. What we always recommend in cases like this is to contact Vimeo and ask them to support restricting videos by user agent too, not just by URL . That way you could configure the video to work in the app. Hopefully if they keep getting requests like this they might implement it in the future. If the client doesn't want to make the videos public, the only solution I can think of is that you edit the SCORM package and manually replace the links to Vimeo to use the wsplayer.php instead. This wsplayer script requires the video ID and a user token (to make sure that only users authenticated in the site can view the video), so you should create a new user that isn't enrolled to any course or anything (because his token can be used to call any WebService), create a WebService token for this user and then use it in the SCORM. The URLs to the site will need to be hardcoded, so this SCORM will only work for a specific site. E.g. if the SCORM has an iframe pointing to https://player.vimeo.com/video/VIDEOID , you should replace the URL with YOURSITEURL/media/player/vimeo/wsplayer.php?video=VIDEOID&token=TOKEN The solution is quite ugly, but it's the only one I can think of.",

When I accessed your site, I could not listen to the audio clips either. The requests to those files were forbidden with the following message: HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required I am guessing that the request is allowed providing that my proxy details have been set as you'd expect them, which is not something the app has control over. Another thing I noticed is that the URL to your files are pointing to a draft area \"draftfile.php\". That does not seem right, draft files are temporary and should not be used to serve content. Technically you might be able to access them if you were the user uploading them, but drafts are usually deleted with 4 days. The URL pointing to your resource should contain \"pluginfile.php\" in order to work both in a browser, and in the app. That problem can often arise when copying content from one place to another. I hope this helps. Cheers, Fred",

Clone the Student system role as Student Mobile, then you can change the value of the permission moodle/webservice:createmobiletoken So for the Student Mobile role this would be ALLOW, and for the normal student it would stay as PREVENT. Then on a course by course basis you can choose which students do and don't have access to that course via the app. Not automatically that I can tell from within moodle - in theory, you could write a script that ran nightly or similar to inspect the database for the conditions to put them into the Student Mobile role for a course. Or maybe someone who knows the really technical stuff better can help with that. HTH though.",

          "Title": "Moodle Mobile Beta is available !",
          "Text": "We are pleased to introduce the Beta version of the new official cross-platform Moodle Mobile app! Our Moodle Mobile app is a HTML5-based client that connects to an installed Moodle server . It does not try to replicate everything that Moodle does - we are focussed on providing features that are most useful on a standalone app, such as offline access to content, messaging and notifications. Please try the new features (and bugs!) and give us feedback on how you would like the app to develop in future. The app may be a little rough around the edges, but we’ll be pushing out bug fixes frequently. Roadmap 1.2 roadmap - April View current progress 1.2 is the initial port of our IOS native app. The version number ended at 1.1. We continue from there. 1.3 roadmap - June View 1.3 progress For 1.3 we’ll continue polishing and fixing issues. 1.4 roadmap - August View 1.4+ progress Starting from 1.4 we’ll add one feature per version. It’s most likely going to be the push notifications for 1.4 . We’ll stand on a 2 month period for release but we may be faster depending of the development speed. In the Agile progress dashboard you’ll be able to visualize the issues for the next version, the version after it, and a backlog of issue for further version. Supported devices All versions can be downloaded from Phonegap Build iOS Limited to registered QA testers - if you don’t mind to report issue on the tracker you can integrate the iOS QA team. Send us an email to mobile@moodle.com . Android Also available on Google Play store . Windows 7 / WebOS / Symbian These version are available but are not tested, neither even supported by HQ. Note that we currently don’t have any plan to support other OS than Android and iOS. If you are experienced in HTML5 Mobile development and are serious about long term maintenance of a different OS, I’ll assign you the related issues with a big smile of happiness. Contact me at mobile@moodle.com . Requirements The app will be useless unless these conditions are satisfied: 1) Your Moodle site must have Moodle 2.4 MINIMUM. 2) Your administrator must have activated Mobile web services. 3) You have a valid user account for that site. If you don't have access to a Moodle site for testing you can try our demo site using a little shortcut we added. Type student or teacher in the url and then the Go button. The app will automatically connect to School Demo . (this doesn’t work yet in the Google Play version) Bugs and requests Main page View current progress Caution This is a Beta version, we do not recommend it for use on production sites (even though the chances of anything going wrong are really extremely low ;) ) Developers Juan Leyva Architecture design, coding, documentation, debugging tools. Barbara Ramiro Original graphic design. Jerome Mouneyrac Project management, testing, releases. Martin Dougiamas Supervising, testing, feedback, editing, prodding. Development community This app has been designed to be used and tweaked by users such as universities, schools, and companies.   We hope to build a development community around the Moodle Mobile app to help it develop faster.  We expect the structure to be fully stable by July, and we’ll make an announcement at that time, so that developers can create derivative projects with a lower risk of refactors in the standard version.",

The app doesn't store the user credentials, it uses a token that is generated the first time the user access (the token is valid for 3 months). Mobile services are only enabled by default in sites using https. We only allow certain features (like auto-login from the app to the site) via https and under certain security restrictions (using a special secured token created the first time a user access). The Mobile service only exposes a subset of the Moodle features (for example, no admin web services are enabled in the mobile service). As long as you site uses https, it will be very safe to use the mobile app (but that also applies to websites, https is mandatory these days) Regards, Juan",

That token needs to be recalculated every time video is open. I wrote a custom Moodle filter that calculates this secure token and embeds an iframe that loads external video from Bunny.net with URL including this token. It works fine on web, but on mobile there is an issue that video is working fine only on first opening. After the token expiration period is over (6 hours), the video stops working. The issue is probably in the fact that Moodle mobile app caches the content of the course page. I need to have this page to be opened fresh, without caching and offline downloading. When I delete the offline content for this video page in Moodle mobile app, video works fine again until expiration period is over. So my question, is there a way to stop Moodle mobile app to cache / download for offline a certain page or entire course?",

Currently there is an integration in the site where the solution is presented in the course content as a side-block. This functions by inserting some JavaScript code which presents a \"click to Listen\" button as well as a JavaScript which controls the functionality of the player. For this to function the content to read needs to be presented on the same page as the JavaScript etc. I've been researching but have not found any way to integrate JavaScript code into the actual content in the mobile app, does anyone have any experience with this or can answer whether it is actually possible or not? The vital point here is that the JavaScript and Listen-button code needs to be loaded and presented on the same page as the content appears, requiring a user to go to a separate page to consume the content via audio is not a good option. Thanks in advance.",

I tried switching the gradle ANDROID_SUPPORT_VERSION from 27.1.0 to 28, and tried switching android-targetSdkVersion from 26 to 27, but no luck. I think sdk 28 might fix it, but I don't think phonegap supports that yet. Are there any particular other versions I could try?",

The students can not send messages to each other. This code has worked great in normal browser sessions but obviously does not work in the mobile app. The app allows anybody to anybody messaging. After looking through code i think the file in <moodle>\\message\\externallib.php handles the code and i have tried putting in an if statment around line 130 if(!user_has_role_assignment($tousers[$message['touserid']],3)) { $success = false; $errormessage = \"invalid message recipient\"; } At the moment I just have a text string for the error rather than loading from the language file as I am not sure if i am looking in the correct place. I dont expect anyone to do the work for me but i was wondering if anyone knew if i am on the right track or if I am wasting my time. In the past when adjusting code, i have always done temporary print statments to the browser to make sure variables are what I am expecting etc but I am assuming i can't do with this the mobile app - is there any equivalent i could use as I feel i am coding in the dark with this? Hope this makes sense Ian",

Tablets are prepared for them in advance by downloading the courses they will take in a particular period. The people involved in preparing the tablets are still using the Moodle Classic app because it allows them to set multiple courses to download and leave the process to finish while they do something else. We would like to start using a branded Moodle app (which has been ready for some time), though experiencing resistance because it does not support downloading multiple courses in tandem - as soon as you leave a course it stops downloading. Is there perhaps someone who knows the reason for this? Or is it worth requesting this feature be \"put back\" into the Moodle Mobile app? Thanks. Jessica",

To do this, I have read extensively about how to customize an authenticated page, which is done  through the mobilecssurl within a typical moodle installation. But my major problems are as follows 1. How do I customize the login Page using the source code provided in github. This is because as you all know, no matter the changes made in the css file hooked on your moodle installation, it doesn't affect the login page. So how do I modify it to suite my needs. 2. Is it possible to lunch the bigbluebutton plugin in the mobile app, if not, how do I modify the source codes to accept that. Thanks a lot in advance.",

          "Text": "Hello Nicholas, 1. If you're creating a custom app then you can just change the app's CSS. If you've set your development environment following this guide then you should place your CSS code in a SCSS file and then run gulp to build the final CSS. We usually split the SCSS files in each component/addon to keep it organized, but you can add it all to www/core/scss/styles.scss for simplicity. If you're using Phonegap Build and you don't use gulp, then you should add your CSS to www/build/mm.bundle.css 2. The official app doesn't support BigBlueButton. You should create an app plugin (www/addons) implementing the BigBlueButton features you need, but I don't think this'll be an easy task. Kind regards, Dani",

You have a web version of the app in here if you want to inspect it without having to set up a development environment: http://prototype.moodle.net/mobile/webapp/ Please notice you'll only be able to connect to Moodle 3.0 or higher due to CORS. Regarding BigBlueButton, the application opens mod_lti activities using an embedded browser (InAppBrowser), I'm not sure if BigBlueButton is going to work in there, you could try.

Before the upgrade it was possible to view .pdf files in mobile devices. I have tried it in several devices as well as several browsers on each. Nothing worked. I do not know if the upgrade did it, or if it is just a coincidence, but now every time there is a pdf it throws an error. Sometimes the error is: \"Cannot display PDF (Title.pdf is of invalid format)\". Before this happens, it acts like the pdf downloads and tries to open. Sometimes it gives this error: \"Sorry, the requested file could not be found\" But in either case, when attempting it from a desktop computer, it works. It also appears to work when using the Moodle app on the mobile devices. I have searched through the forums and tried several things: o Changed the way the file opens in the browser window. Depending on the forum thread I changed it to: Open in a new window, open in the same window. o Also, d epending on the forum thread, I chang ed the way it displays: Automatic, Embed, Forced Download , Open, and In popup. None of these worked. I also read about uploading them manually and also looking for them in the moodle directory and also the moodledata/filedir directory. But then I have no idea where to go after that. Any help that anyone can give me will be greatly appreciated. To reiterate, it worked flawlessly before. Now they do not work.",

          "Text": "I'm struggling trying to add mobile functionality to my questionnaire plugin. One of the key understanding issues I have is understanding why I would need web services instead of just using the \"mobile\" class and methods. The \" core-site-plugins-new-content \" directive allows me to call my \"mobile\" methods direct. This would seem to be the correct way to deal with my module which can contain many pages of forms. I am currently having problems with the \"useOtherData\" argument, but I believe this can be resolved (I hope). Assuming I can get that argument to work, and all of my form data can be passed into the class method, this should be all I need. But, if I can't get that to work, then I may need to use one of the \" core-site-plugins-call-ws \". But I am unclear on why I would need to do this. And if I have to use it, how do I do something with the data returned from the service? I need to be able to process the data that was returned from the form, and then potentially react to incorrect data. This can be returned in a structure from the service, but to where? I don't see any way to act on the return values. Any help?",

What I've done is, I simply pulled the container from the docker hub and finally started the container: docker pull moodlehq/moodlemobile2 cls && docker run -p 8100:8100 moodlehq/moodlemobile2 I'm finally getting the following output: > moodlemobile@3.8.0 ionic:serve /app > npx gulp watch & npx ionic-app-scripts serve -b --devapp --address=0.0.0.0 [09:40:44] Using gulpfile /app/gulpfile.js [09:40:44] Starting 'watch'...

Unfortunately, when I try to access http://localhost:8100 I'm getting a white page only. In 2016/2017 there was a discussion ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=342928 ) about the white screen but I'm not sure the correct reason (maybe the missing siteurl). But how can I specify the siteurl for the docker container? Do I need to create my own docker container? Instead of the white screen I expected to see a input field (like https://stackoverrun.com/de/q/11157241 ). Any ideas/suggestions?",

I have checked everything I could (mobile app is enabled, moodle version is okay; '3.7+ (Build: 20190614)'), and the same site works with the desktop app on my computer. The only thing I have found is that one of the ssl checkers recommended in this site says that the letsencrypt root cert is not in the certificate chain. Does the mobile app recognize letsencrypt? Or is it depending on the mobile os (Android in this case)? Is it the problem, or should I search further? If the problem with letsencrypt, can I avoid somehow to use another certificate?",

          "Text": "Hello we have been\nusing Moodle at our school since 2012. Most recently, we updated our system\nfrom 3.6 to version 3.8 after a server change and have now opted in the Premium\nPlan in the app model. The system occasionally has 20,000 accesses per day. We are using the default Airnotifier messaging server with the default moodle mobile app. Although the\nupdate went smoothly, we have great difficulties with the notifications. We\nreceive a lot of emails several times, even days later. PUSH messages are also\nsent multiple times. The messages come from group chats and forum posts as well\nas from private messages. It looks as if a login of the sender to the system\nwould trigger the re-dispatch. Based on the\nforum contributions here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=390198 a nd here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=362959#p1530200? I could see a message being sent from the app, but the clock icon remained.\nThe generated email arrived only 1 minute later, the PUSH message did not\narrive at all. The process aborted and a new process was created. The app also\nmarked the message as sent, while a copy of the original message automatically\nappeared in the app, which in turn remained with the clock icon. If another\nnext message is sent, the previous message is marked as sent, while the new\nmessage is now sent again and again. A glance at the log suggests that a login\nof the sender or participant of a group will restart the process. The call of the\nservice via the browser showed that the process is going through perfectly for\nsome students, while for other students it dies and causes the browser to\ncrash. Our administrator\nwas able to contribute the following messages: “I see many\nentries in the log that indicate a problem with the airserver: \"[Tue Apr 28\n21:37:00.727720 2020] [php7:notice] [pid 867] [client 91.249.185.4:63019] Debugging: Unexpected response from the Airnotifier server:  in \\n* line 173 of /message/output/airnotifier/classes/manager.php: call to debugging()\\n* line 92 of /message/output/airnotifier/classes/manager.php: call to message_airnotifier_manager->create_token()\\n* line 110 of /message/output/airnotifier/message_output_airnotifier.php: call to message_airnotifier_manager->get_user_devices()\\n* line 501 of /lib/classes/message/manager.php: call to message_output_airnotifier->send_message()\\n* line 308 of /lib/classes/message/manager.php: call to core\\\\message\\\\manager::call_processors()\\n* line 276 of /lib/classes/message/manager.php: call to I don't find\nthe error text really helpful now, the most meaningful is perhaps \"Unexpected\nresponse\". More exciting is a small comparison: zgrep air moodle-error.log*.gz|wc\n-l 3764 results. So there were 3764 calls that resulted in an error. zgrep airnotifier moodle-access.log*.gz|wc\n-l 35 results. So there were 35 calls that _no_ error. \" I have now\ndisabled the messaging feature in the app and in fact the bad messages have decreased. But that's not the solution. Where can we start now?",

          "Text": "Hi Ewald, I think there are several issues here: 1. We\nreceive a lot of emails several times, even days later. PUSH messages are also\nsent multiple times. If you are receiving both emails and Push messages several times it could because there are two simultaneous cron / scheduled tasks running processing the same messages queue. Could you check in your server cronjob configuration if you are executing the scheduled tasks several times? This usually happens also in cluster environments, when you have more than one server or when a system was migrated from one server to another but the cronjob was not deactivated. 2. Debugging: Unexpected response from the Airnotifier server: In this case what I feel is that the request failed because so many Push notifications were being processed at the same time for your site, it could be related to point 1 (duplicates emails and Push) Apart from that, I checked the Airnotifier server logs and I didn't see any recent critical error reported by the server. In any case, we are going to add additional debugging in the Airnotifier responses so we can improve debugging in general.",

It's been a great success and I can see attendees doing quizzes while commuting, etc. My existing Moodle site provides updated lecture slides by embedding PDF's, which I've noticed requires the PDF be downloaded and then viewed in the Android (in my own case) PDF viewer. I'm researching whether there are better options. I also use Google Slides and have experimented with embedding a Google Slides presentation into a test course - which worked well on the web, but the slides, which are embedded into a note on the course page, do not seem to be reachable on the app. Is this perhaps because they're on the course page? The text-only note above them appears just fine. What other applications are you using to make lecture slides available? --- Les",

With the phone held vertically, though, the slide is a bit on the small side, and the forward/play/back controls visible at the bottom of the presentation on the web are not there in the Mobile app. Turning the screen to landscape mode results in the slide filling the width of the screen, but now the bottom part of the slide is not visible and can't be scrolled into view. It looks spectacular when viewed in a desktop browser, though - and the ability to collaboratively edit a presentation and have the new version immediately reflected in Moodle is awfully attractive - no more 'print to PDF and upload ' sessions! --- Les",

The app itself is working fine, but I noticed when completing a SCORM package, that the app will crash and reload from the main page. The odd thing though, is that the attempt is registered, but the completion is not tracked. For example, I have a basic two question SCORM that through the regular Moodle app will complete and track, online it is completing and tracking, but my customised one does not. I haven't changed any of the core code - all I've done is change the theming and set the site address when logging in. To begin with, PhoneGap did not work, and I have had to download the PhoneGap repository from GitHub, and copy across the changes I've made to the PhoneGap file before uploading it to PhoneGap. Any help with this is greatly appreciated",

The version 3.2.0 of the app will work fine with Moodle 3.2. Moodle Mobile 3.2.0 will still work with older versions of Moodle, but you might lack some of the new features. Also, older versions of the app work with Moodle 3.2, but in this case you'll also lack the latest features of the app. So in order to have the maximum number of features we suggest to use the latest version of the app and Moodle.

          "Text": "Hi, I see you're adding the core-external-content directive to the \"source\", that directive should try to download the file in the following cases: If the size of the file is less than 20MB and the user is on WiFi, or if the file less than 2MB, it should be downloaded the first time it's rendered. If the file is bigger than that and the user is on WiFi, it should be downloaded in background the first time the user plays it. Please check that you fulfill any of those conditions. In the directive core-format-text we apply core-external-content automatically to all media elements, and in case of \"source\" elements we convert the \"src\" to \"target-src\", I guess we found a problem when using \"src\" directly (probably the video didn't detect the change of URL ). So if the video is not downloaded, you can try using [targetSrc]=\"'<% urlout %>'\" instead of src (please notice there are single quotes inside double quotes. If this still doesn't work, you can try debugging the core-external-content directive to see why it isn't downloading the file. Or you can also try using core-format-text , but that means converting the video HTML to a string so it's better if core-external-content works properly without doing this. Cheers, Dani",

          "Text": "Hi sadaf, one possible solution could be to use a URL in the app that downloads the decoded file already, so the file stored in the app wouldn't need to be decoded. But maybe you don't want to do that for security/privacy reasons. The first thing you need is the local path of the file, and you can obtain it using the CoreFilepoolProvider service in the Javascript code returned along with the template, in your classes/output/mobile.php. For example, you can use: \n```text\nconst url = 'THE URL OF THE FILE'; // If you don't have this URL in JS code, you can pass it to JS using otherdata and this.CONTENT_OTHERDATA.\n```\n \n```text\nconst path = await this.CoreFilepoolProvider.getFilePathByUrl(this.CoreSitesProvider.getCurrentSiteId(), url);\n```\n With this code you will have the path of the file. Please notice that the file needs to be downloaded, if the file isn't downloaded you should either use the online URL or you can force downloading the file using \n```text\nthis.CoreFilepoolProvider.downloadUrl(this.CoreSitesProvider.getCurrentSiteId(), url)\n```\n This function will download the file if needed, and then return the path. Once you have the path, you can read the file. Maybe the fetch function will work for local files too, but we usually use: \n```text\nthis.CoreFileProvider.readFile(path, format);\n```\n Where format is 0 for text, 1 for data URL, 2 for binary string and 3 for array buffer. Looking at your code, I guess you want to use format=3. I hope this helps. Cheers, Dani",

I have a problem with integrating mobile support to the plugin, for now i make only basic thing to make the mod_questionnaire mobile based, but it everytime tells \" Uh oh! Your organisation installed a plugin that is not yet supported .\" I make the mobile version based on mod_certificate and removed all of Webservices calls and so on. I use Moodle Desktop to test it, because web version cannot show external plugins as mobile-based (for example mod_certificate). Im Windows based, my npm gulp task makes controllers and services folders empty, so i make ZIP manually and put it into mobile folder. I created mobile.php inside db folder. But Moodle Desktop everytime shows the module as web-based. I dont know what to do, i just need to understand how to make it and then all will be possible. Please help)) GitHub: https://github.com/tigusigalpa/mod_questionnaire_mobile",

We are on Moodle 3.8 and using the free version of Moodle Mobile 3.9.2. I can see Course completion from this page: Administration / Mobile app / Mobile features and have tried to disable this feature, but I guess I can only do one at a time?

Because there's no real documentation on how to target specific components and the example themes do not discuss the progress bar, I had to repeatedly rename the URL by appending a version hash \"#1\" \"#2\" etc to it to keep trying new CSS approaches. It seemed like you also had to log out and back in to see the fresh styles. Finally, this CSS worked: .core-progress-bar progress, .core-progress-text { display: none !important; } I'm not sure how much of that is necessary but this was the first thing that actually worked. The Moodle Mobile Themes doc is useful but doesn't list all the components or how target them with selectors, so I looked at the mobile app's github repo to figure that out.",

          "Text": "Hello, I have been\nable to download and use courses that include SCORM packages with Moodle 3.3\nand the Mobile App 3.3.1 without problems until recently, but have in the last\nfew days made a number of changes to our Moodle site (installed several\nlanguage packs, incl. Arabic, configured the front page - Late addition : including HTML-blocks! I just noticed that they are not supported by the app - could this be the reason for the error?) and now cannot\nopen any courses to the app any more, either on my Android or my iOS\ndevice. The error message is the same in both: “Invalid response value detected”\nand “Error getting my overview data”. It is displayed soon after clicking on my\nuser account area in the app. I then changed the debug messages parameter to DEBUG\nand the checked “Display debug messages”, restarted the App, but the error\nmessages are the same without any detail. I have seen\nseveral posts in this forum on this error, but none of them applies to this\nsituation. For instance, the userquota is set at 104857600 (no other characters\nor spaces in the field).  Here is the\nrelevant system information: Moodle 3.3\n(Build: 20170515), not using secure connection, Moodle Mobile App 3.3.1, Essential\ntheme, Android 5.1.1, iOS 10.3.3 I would be\ngrateful for assistance on this. Thank you! Carl",

Once the module is uploaded on the Moodle platform, I can download it on the Moodle App on launch it. On the Mac OS version of the Moodle App, everything is working well. On iOS, the module is not loaded. I would like to point out that the module works well on IOS from Moodle on Safari. My question are: - Is there a way to check the console of the browser within the IOS Mobile App ? - How the scorm module is launched within the APP : does it use a kind of local web server that allow xmlhttprequest to be performed ? - Is there a difference between how the scorm player is implemented in the moodle APP between MAC and IOS ?

These videos are stored on Vimeo.com and protected by some privacy settings which include allowing embeding only in pages hosted on sanskritforum.org When we try access to our courses via Moodle Mobile, however, these videos will not show up, as Vimeo's server does not recognize our URL behind the apps call to embed the video. So we guess that our domain has been somehow changed or hidden by the app - far enough to block our video from streaming. As if another domain was taking place of ours, triggering the privacy blocking on Vimeo. My question is: what other domain name should be enabled in my privacy settings at Vimeo to avoid that blocking of our content when accessed by the app?",

If you auto-login in in-app browser you'll have to wait 6 minutes to be able to auto-login in the system browser. Once authenticated in the system browser, the session should be kept for future requests. Also, we detected that in some devices the in-app browser session is resetted when it's closed, so in that case the auto-login will only work once every 6 minutes in in-app browser.

          "Text": "Hi Teja,\nThe reason you're having problems is that the core components of the app aren't implemented as site plugins, as our custom plugins are. They are implemented directly within the app, as Angular modules (these are called \"addons\" in the app's code). What you've told the app to do is load a new page by calling the `\\mod_quiz\\output\\mobile::get_attempt_review()` , but if you look in mod_quiz, you'll see it has no `mobile` class in classes/output. One possibility would be to replace `core-site-plugins-new-content` with `core-site-plugins-call-ws-new-content` , if you can make that do what you want. Another possibility is to have a javascript function to load the page from the mod_quiz addon, something like: \n```text\n(function(t) {\n    function openQuizAttempt(event) {\n        t.NavController.push('addon-mod-quiz-attempt', [attemptId, quizId, courseId]);\n    }\n})(this);\n```\n Then attach it to your button with `(click)=\"openQuizAttempt($event)\"` If you've not got your head around Javascript in your plugins yet, check out this thread where we discussed it recently.",

I cannot find this information in the documentation. I have not yet tried the JS approach, but if I understand correctly, I can load this specific page (attempt review) with it - like I would, for example, create an <a> link in HTML?",

In order to make the release process more sustainable and to improve our Q&A process, we will be releasing new versions every two months starting soon (probably when Moodle 3.1 is released). The plan will be to release new versions at the same time (same week) that new major or minor Moodle versions are released. Versioning: Once we start releasing along Moodle, we’ll align Moodle version numbers with the Moodle Mobile ones. Once Moodle 3.1 is released, we’ll release Moodle Mobile 3.1.0. Every time minor Moodle versions are released we’ll increase the last digit so, for example, when Moodle 3.1.1 is out, we’ll release Moodle Mobile 3.1.1. The second digit will be increased when Moodle major versions are released. Hopefully, this will avoid confusions with the version numbering between Moodle and Moodle Mobile. Emergency releases: In some cases, we’ll need to release a new version at a different time than a Moodle one. When this happens, we will increase the last digit too.",

          "Text": "Hi there, The delegate you mention would be used if you need to add support for new types of files, but if you only need to upload a file it shouldn't be necessary to add a new handler. In your case, you should be able to upload files using existing services. In particular, I'd suggest that you look into src/core/features/fileuploader . From plugins, you have access to most services. You can see which ones are available looking at src/core/features/compile/services/compile.ts . For example, it is importing `CORE_FILEUPLOADER_SERVICES` which exposes `CoreFileUploaderProvider` , `CoreFileUploaderHelperProvider` and `CoreFileUploaderDelegateService` . If you want to see how these services are used in the app, I'd suggest that you clone the source code of the app and search for usages. If you want to understand the codebase of the app better, I'd suggest that you read the Moodle App Development Guide . You don't need to read this to develop plugins, but if you're working on a use-case that is not explicitly documented in the plugins guide, you'll probably have to dig into the source code and it will be useful to understand it. Also, check out this previous post in the forum about a similar topic: Taking a Picture / File Upload from Moodle App in custom plugin .",

It seems that the header frame does not function the same as it does on PC. When a user scrolls a page it will also scroll the header frame instead of just the content, this means they would have to scroll all the way back to the top. Now from what I understand this is simply because Safari mobile does not support fixed position, in addition to auto sizing out frames to fit there content.

          "Text": "The Moodle Mobile app works through web services. To add full editing would require the creation of new web services which is fairly complex. My advice is that creating full editing for Moodle mobile would be enormously complex  and too difficult for a student project. Plus the benefit would be not significant as mobile devices are not ideal for editing content. For a student it would make more sense to investigate the creation of an editing feature for a specific feature or plugin. One of the advantages of this is that understanding web services in Moodle would give you an understanding of technologies that are very widely used outside Moodle.

          "Text": "Hi, the Moodle app communicates with the server using WebServices . So for example when the user opens the \"My courses\" page, we call the appropriate WebServices to retrieve that info. The app has a cache system (using a local database) to avoid calling the server too often. So for example if a user opens a certain course several times in a short time, the first time the app will perform a request to the server to obtain the latest data but the following requests will use the data that is already stored in the device. This system is the one that allows the app to work in offline. The \"valid time\" of the information depends of the WebService (whether the data retrieved can change often or not), and it can go from 7 minutes to 18 hours. In general there is no synchronization system to keep this information up to date, it will be updated the next time the user opens the page in online and the data is no longer \"valid\". When a user tries to create/edit/delete something in offline and the app allows it, we store the data in a local database to be sent when the user is connected. There are several factors that can impact how often we try to send the offline data to the server, the app usually waits 5 - 15 minutes between retries (e.g. if the server is down). So yes, the app has a local db to store the data (it uses sql ite). Cheers, Dani",

So for now we require this code to be present and up-to-date\nin the source repository. ( https://f-droid.org/en/docs/FAQ_-_App_Developers/ ) So maybe you want to check that out.

          "Text": "Good Morning, I need a little more information on the problem that is presented to me. I have a Moodle 3.1.6 platform configured for a multi-authentication, since I have as main method of authentication against SSO CAS and the possibility of access through certain manual accounts. So far so good. The problem arises when you want to use the Moodle Mobile app with these settings. To begin, according to the documentation, if you have CAS authentication you have to install a plugin \"Additional Features of Moodle Mobile\" in which among other things configure the type of login: Through the APP Using a built-in browser (for SSO plugins) Via a browser window (for SSO connectors) I install and configure it, both with option 2 and option 3. But it behaves in the following way, not being the expected behavior: I access the app on iOS, enter the URL where I want to connect. It opens a browser embedded as I configured it above, where it shows me the screen of multiidentification (users cas and users not cas). I select CAS user, and it takes me to CAS authentication. I authenticate, and the problem comes when I access the platform, it is as if I continue in the embedded browser, not having the appearance of the APP Moodle Mobile (orange appearance) but the appearance of the platform as I see it on a desktop PC . On the other hand, in another node that uses tests, same version 3.1.6, with the same configuration of multi-identification (CAS + manual), if I do not install the plugin \"Additional Features of Moodle Mobile\", and access to the app Moodle Mobile with a user with a manual account, returns me to the moodle mobile app with its appearance and the functionalities that can be configured. If I login with a CAS user it gives me an error. How can I solve this? Or is the issue of Multi-Identification a problem to make use of this APP? Thank you very much in advance.",

If you haven't done any manual change to the iOS project you can try to re-install the platform too. About the deprecated plugin, we've known it for a while but we didn't use the new version because it's not supported by ngCordova. It's been a while though, so maybe we should change the plugin and use its API instead of ngCordova. Cheers, Dani",

In my opinion it would bring you more revenue from Premium subscriptions, as I am sure there are others with the same need. Thanks for your consideration. Kind regards, Romeo",

This could either be connecting to your custom Air Notifier server or routing via messages. moodle.net . Is there a queuing system already in Moodle where if a personal message is sent between users it is queued somewhere before it is pushed out to AirNotifier and the relevant Messaging cloud service ( GCM or APNS)  or is everything sent in one go ? Appreciate that one user interacting with the system wouldn't put too much load on the system but a couple of hundred users interacting and are waiting to receive their notifications ? I know for a fact that when you download the generic Moodle mobile app from play stores it by default connects to messages.moodle.net if you have the Access Key so it must be quite robust in handling all the moodle sites around the world ?! Many thanks for your help Hittesh Ahuja",

I added a port number  I have checked the url several times (asked my wife to check my typing too) - since my server is Linux I have checked for capitalisation. I've tried searching for similar cases, to see which port I should use, and drawn a blank (I think a port isn't required is it?). I'm running PHP 5.4.21 on Linux. My version of Moodle runs fine on a 'normal' box. Would someone be kind enough to have a think for me, please? Kind regards Ian",

Between the suggested tools and IDEs our team have chosen Eclipse for developing the website. I have been thoroughly searching the Moodle Mobile documentations but haven't been able to find many standards for mobile development environments. Except for this document which suggests using Sublime IDE and plugins for AngularJS and Ionic framework which I've been using them until now. We as a startup team are trying to use same IDEs and development tools as much as possible while complying to Moodle standards. My question here is that does Moodle suggest any development environment (IDEs, tools, etc) for developing custom mobile apps? Is using Eclipse for hybrid mobile apps efficient? Is it even a correct strategy to use development environments for mobile same as for Moodle website? (since at core they both use similar web development technologies) Thanks in advance",

We like the convenience of students not needing to reauthenticate often, but also see the privacy/security issue in never logging them out. We recently turned out biometric login in hopes that that will make the autologout easier on users. I also have one question about how this feature works which I can't answer from reading the setting and the mobile app documentation. Does the logout timer reset when a user returns to the app before it's elapsed? In other words, if we set it to one week, does that mean users login every week or only after a week-long absence? I think it's the latter but I'm not sure.",

As I found, after you start the mobile app for the first time, it receives the Airnotifier server information from Moodle site, and then registers its token with it. By calling airnotifier API it is easy to register a token manually, but this process must by automatic. Moodle app uses Adobe Phonegap push plugin to receive notifications. I think the problem might be due to restrictions to access Adobe sites due to sanctions. If this is true, you will be able to receive notifications with VPN.

          "Title": "3 Critical issues with SCORM courses on mobile.",
          "Text": "Hello, I am having problems with my SCORM courses while running on mobile. Two issues are related to dedicated Moodle app and one for the browser. 1) I have text box objects where a student is supposed to type text. On iOS, this text box is active and touch keyboard is shown, but typing doesn't add text. I have to click outside the text box for the keyboard to be hidden and then click on the text box to activate keyboard again. Only after doing that I can type. On Android keyboard is active and I can type from the beginning, but sometimes if I accidentally tap outside of text box, the keyboard will be hidden and SCORM becomes unresponsive. I have to press back button, but it resets the course. This doesn't happen all the time 2) SCORM progress is not saved on Android. I am using local storage to save progress. For example: localStorage.Level1Progress = parseInt(Level1Progress, 10); But this doesn't persist after I press \"Back\" inside the app and re-enter SCORM package. 3) Inside browser when I pan around, view tends to jump back to default position every time I am trying to pan away. It is a bit hard to explain, but when I pan, the view doesn't stay where I left off. I think these are critical issues and wonder if Moodle mobile team is aware of them. I have created SCORM in Adobe Captivate and I have been testing this exact SCORM package in another LMS mobile app and everything was working fine. if you decide to check the issues I am having on your device, please use this address inside your Moodle app: http://allaxes.info/classroom/ The course is free for self-enrollment. I can also record a video next time if my explanation is confusing. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you",

Please let me know if I made a mistake and I'll move my post elsewhere. Issue: I am unable to use the moodle app if it was connected to a cache server . The cache server configuration is working for other apps (such as Instagram, WhatsApp) and is configured for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. I was able to confirm this by browsing and downloading the same file from 2 clients, and it worked as intended. The issue that is occurring with the moodle app specifically is that there are no requests being sent from the app to the server (I tailed the access log and found no requests relating to moodle, whereas I was able to find requests for Instagram app or any website I visit through the browser). The app itself takes time to load, and eventually doesn't load (just like using it in offline mode) Details: - Moodle app version: 4.1.0 - Tested on android devices only so far (new devices + few years old devices). - I am using Squid proxy/cache server and running it on an ubuntu machine (ubuntu 22.04.2 lts) - Let me know if you require any more details. Use Case: I installed a cache server on a school network to allow students to use\nour branded moodle app with minimal bandwidth consumption and at faster speeds. Question(s): - I was wondering if moodle uses some other protocol other than HTTP/s?",

I actually only recently got this plugin fully working, but then I ended up merging it with a much larger \"Equipment\" plugin I'm working on (which is also free and open source, though not finished yet). The big thing that kept me from making this plugin usable for my use-case was that I wanted users to be redirected to the phone verification page if their phone had not yet been verified, but this should not happen with every user; only with users assigned with the role of \"Parent\" to another user, i.e. their students. Parents need to verify their phones; students do not. Thinking long-term for my company, theoretically, parents could be students and students could be parents. Because of this possibility, I had to figure out how to differentiate different types of user accounts. I found one way, though it's not the best. Anyway, the plugin should actually still be working, but users must go to the phone verification page to verify their phones manually. My Equipment plugin may be worth checking out when it's done, but it's a big boy, and I'm only 1 person, so it'll have a good amount of flaws, and some dirty code.",

It seems like the  gulp remoteaddon bundling step might grab .js test files and concatenate them with the rest of the js in addon.js, it was then complaining about the 'describe' function used in the test file on load. Not sure if that's a bug in the gulp step or I'm just doing something wrong, but for now deleting the file gets me to the point where the remote addon loads and works 99% and I can debug the rest. edit: oh and when one addon errors, it stops installation of all of them it seems, so I needed to test the two remote addons seperately. When I did that the mod certificate one worked fine.",

I would have thought that something coming from within the app wouldn't trigger such a security issue, but then I guess when it's a remote addon then it's not technically part of the app since it's getting downloaded. The docs only say that the same port, domain and protocol are required, which I think is the case here. But it also talks about whitelists and blacklists so perhaps this is hitting a blacklist? I'm not really familiar enough with Ionic etc. to know how I should proceed here. Do you know if this is supported in remote addons, and what I would need to do to make this work if it is?",

Yes, I know the My Moodle is no longer supported but I think this issue is related more to the architecture of Moodle itself, and not directly to the mobile app. To confirm the problem isn’t the My Moodle, I enrolled in Moodle.org and I’m able to see participant pictures just fine using the mobile app. The picture feature on the mobile app is important because a new cohort is starting next week and linking pictures, bios and phone numbers is probably one of the most useful features of the mobile app as we begin our hybrid program and community building. I’ve searched various settings and preferences in Moodle 2.3.1 but nothing has worked.  I thought I found something via Site administration>Security>Site Policies>Force users to login to view user pictures - but changing this setting didn’t help. To help troubleshoot, I contacted a coder and asked his opinion regarding possible solutions.  He isn’t familiar with Moodle but he let me know that it is common for some platforms to create thumbnail files and scripts that function as pointers - but they often get misdirected or the pictures are incorrectly resized.  This sparked interest because the problem started when I batch imported user pictures via the administrative setting Users>Accounts> Upload user pictures (I used the username attribute and a .zip file with jpg images.)  The batch import automatically created .png files which work fine within the Web version of the Moodle, but not on the mobile app. Because I am still learning the various Moodle administrative roles I need help explaining the Moodle architecture to my local coder.  Where are the Participant Profile pictures actually stored?  Does the batch import method I describe above create pointer scripts and thumbnails?  If so, where can they be found on our server directory?  Would the mobile app have a different folder for these profile images?  Are there administrative settings within Moodle that allow me to manage these processes? Any help is appreciated!",

This function is going to be called for each course, and the courseId is passed as a parameter: https://github.com/moodlehq/moodlemobile2/blob/master/www/core/components/courses/services/delegate.js#L80 So you don't need to manually call that function, it will be automatically called.

          "Text": "Hi Gavin, this issue was fixed for 3.5.2 version of the app (latest), but the solution has some limitations. We use auto-login to authenticate the user in the H5P activity (see this Moodle issue for more information). The requirements to make this work are: The site needs to use Moodle 3.2 or higher. The site needs to use https, not http. The user needs to have a private token. This is created when the user token is created (the user authenticates in the app). If the user authenticated in the app when your server was using a Moodle older than 3.2 you might need to invalidate all tokens to force them to re-create the token. You can see the private tokens in the database , table external_tokens, there is a privatetoken column. A user can only auto-login once every 6 minutes. Auto-login is usually triggered when an iframe pointing to the site is viewed in the app (your case) or when the app opens a URL pointing to the site in the browser of the device. Please notice that the session in an iframe is usually kept for a while unless the user restarts the app, this means that if the user views the H5P and it works he'll be able to view it again without triggering the auto-login if he doesn't restart the app. Cheers, Dani",

We tried to build a Windows version of Moodle Mobile using the \"windows\" platform of Cordova (which only works for 10, and to a lesser degree for 8, and not for 7), and the generated Visual Studio templates, however run into the usual ydn-db DataError due to the web view used, right after logging in. The Moodle Mobile desktop app does not produce that error, so I am guessing that a different approach is used here. Are there any additional patches required for building Moodle Desktop that did not make it to the repository, or are there any pointers or build scripts that you could share?

And if the player is Flash, well then there's your reason why it won't show on an iDevice. You might want to try running your h.264-encoded video through the QuickTime browser plugin. Search around on the web for QuickTime <object/embed> techniques. You might find some helpful info here: http://www.apple.com/quicktime/tutorials/embed.html",

It rewrites an mov, m4v, or mp4 link into some markup to load the video using quicktime plugin using an object tag. This works for me using moodle using safari on iphone. But only on suitably sized video files, which are 640x480 or smaller. It looks like mobile safari on ipod / iphone inspects the actual video file to determine if it is playable, and whether it is playable appears to depend on resolution and filetype. It may also depend on bitrate and network connection type - whether the device is connected via wifi, 3g or 2g phone network. Watch on iphone - when it is given an html5 <video> tag or a quicktime <object> tag, a quicktime placeholder appears, and then a short time later either the play icon or unplayable icon appears in the centre of the video placeholder.",

Custom notifications mean you can have more notifications for other Moodle events? Or is it that you can change the text of existing notifications? And this also applies to push notifications? You can already change the download page for the app in Moodle. A custom download page mean the Moodle team will design a download page for you and host it? Thanks!",

I am in the process of developing my first Moodle Mobile app and hit a wall with Moodle requiring a trusted SSL Certificate to enable the Mobile functionality. I understand why an online website should have a trusted SSL Cert but this is causing problem for me with an internal dev server . I am running my dev Moodle 3.6.2 install on a vagrant (Debian 9.8) accessible with a self-signed cert on an IP address on Linux Mint. I am sure someone figured out the SSL problem on dev server before. I don't want to develop and test my app on a production server (we currently have 2000 students) and I can't get a trusted cert on a local dev server. What do you guys develop your Moodle Mobile app on? What is your setup/workflow? Any advice/suggestion/article are welcome Thank you in advance for your support Take care,",

          "Text": "Thank you, Juan, for your reply. I totally understand that maintaining documents is a time-consuming task and needs a lot of efforts and time that is preferred to be spent on the actual development. I have a little concern and really appreciate if you or anyone from the core team can elaborate a bit more. The Custom Mobile app creation service that Moodle HQ offers is surely a valuable service but is it going to threaten the availability of the Moodle App source code to the public in any way in future? You are right about the existence of developers with significant achievements with Moodle Mobile App. However, there are many other developers on the other hand, that need a little help to start so that they can contribute to the development of the app and maybe in near future you would have enough contributions from the wider community to give you enough time to take care of maintaining docs. I believe this is happening for the Moodle code itself and there are many non-HQ contributors that raise bugs, provide patches to fix bugs, propose new features and sometimes provide patches to implement their proposal. I don't see this happening for the mobile app though. Obviously, I don't have enough information about what's going on as you have and I might be 100 percent wrong. But I think that Moodle is depriving itself of potential contributions by not maintaining the development documents. It is worth to consider that many people that are involved in Moodle development in any way do not have Cordova development background. Many of them are experienced PHP developers, but they need some help to start riding a new horse.",

If the issue doesn't happen in Moodlecloud, only in your site, you can try to debug the issue yourself. You can follow this guide to debug the network requests: https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/network-debug You should look for the WebService call \"mod_quiz_get_attempt_access_information\". This call returns an endtime, maybe it's returning a wrong value. Cheers, Dani",

If the problem is that Moodle editor doesn't convert it automatically to a link, that is because it uses a non-standard protocol and it includes links inside it, you will need to make it a link yourself using the anchor HTML tag. That is, you will need to put HTML code like this: <a href=\"moodlemobile://https://username@domain.com?token=TOKEN&privatetoken=PRIVATETOKEN&redirect=http://domain.com/course/view.php?id=2\">Open the course in the Moodle App</a> If you're generating that code from PHP then I'm not sure how it's done, but I guess there's a function to create a link.

There is a table called user_devices that records information from the app and includes a lastmodified column. It looks like the mobile token will by default expire every 12 weeks. So a query on records that have been updated in the last year will typically indicate that a user has used the app at least once in that period. Combining that with lastlogin data from the user table should give a finer grain of information.\n\nI am currently working with this query to count the numbers of “logins” using the mobile app over the last 12 months (or settable period of time), using report_customsql\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ud.userid) AS users_who_have_logged_in\nFROM {user_devices} ud\nJOIN {user} u ON u.id = ud.userid\nWHERE u.lastlogin >= :since_lastlogin_date\nAND ud.timemodified >= :since_timemodified_date\n\nAll feedback is greatly appreciated.",

The app can call this WS quite a lot if the user has the discussion open in the app because we try to fetch the messages every 10 seconds, but 16000 in 10 hours sounds too much (it's more than 25 calls per minute!). In Moodle 3.6 the messaging system was improved and the amount of WS calls needed when viewing a discussion was reduced, maybe that can help you reduce the number of WS calls. You can disable the messaging in the app using the Moodle mobile additional features plugin . Install the plugin, go to \"Site administration > Plugins > Local plugins > Moodle Mobile additional features > Disabled features\" and select these options: Main menu: Messages User: Send message Please notice that users won't be able to view or send messages in the app after changing this, they'll have to do it in browser.

To troubleshoot, I’ve already enabled full debugging by adding the following lines to my `config.php` file. \n```text\nerror_reporting\n(E_ALL | E_STRICT);\n\n\n\n\nini_set\n(\n'display_errors'\n, \n1\n);\n\n\n\n\n$CFG\n->debug = (E_ALL | E_STRICT);\n\n\n\n\n$CFG\n->debugdisplay = \ntrue\n;\n```\n However, no PHP errors are being displayed, and the error logs are also empty. I would really appreciate any guidance or suggestions on how to identify what’s causing this issue. Thank you in advance for your help.",

The outstanding parts of the app are its readability and responsiveness, plus its ability to work offline. If West Africa where I teach, data is very expensive. The offline functionality is truly a blessing to my students! You may lock this discussion if you like. And thanks for your quick reply.",

'Yes' when a user has registered (logged in with) at least one device and has made a connection using the app the last 30 days. It is 'No' when the user has not registered a device or after 30 days of no connection. The specifics would mean: -The OS (Android/iOS, version numbers) -The resolution of the user -What version of the Moodle app they have installed This will clear the way for some great new functionality. Administrators can identify what devices their users are on (and identify possible OS/device specific issues). Also, with the \"Mobile User\" field, plugins can start sending automated messages to users that will be pushed to their devices. When they are not a \"Mobiile User\", an email can be sent to those users as fallback option. I'm interested to hear your thoughts! Would you want this info as well? Do you have additional wishes?",

Considering it is mobile support then a lot of these webservices aren't supported by mobile app. Is it because some of these webservices are simply not useful in a mobile scenario therefore not implemented or is there a design or implementation issue regarding availability for mobile. Or maybe just they had low priority and there was not enough dev time for them? What I'm trying to understand here is that if anyone wanted to use any of these (supposedly?) unsupported webservices for mobile app would there be a way to make such webservice available to app? How would a webservice be suitable to be used in a mobile app or not?",

          "Text": "We are having a problem with the Android app user interface on our tablet devices. We are running Moodle 2.7.3+ (Build: 20141211) and v1.15 of the Android app. The app works very well on our phones but on our tablets we cannot navigate past the selection of a course. When the app is started on a tablet and a user logs in, you are presented with the welcome screen and the main menu. Selecting items on the main menu seems to work fine. If you select My Courses the drop down menu of available courses expands. Selecting a course causes the drop down menu of \"Contents, Participants, Grades\" to appear. Clicking on Contents refreshes the display and presents two columns. The left column is a menu of the course sections and the right column shows the contents of the General section. At this point the options in the left menu (which should allow selection of different course sections) becomes unresponsive. In addition you cannot select any of the resources displayed in the right pane. Long-pressing any of the Section items in the left pane does highlight the item (indicating that the press is being registered) but nothing happens. The same for the resources in the right pane. Selecting the \"info\" icon or download icon (where they are available) does register correctly. We have tried this on several tablets and all behave similarly. I fully expected to see someone else reporting the problem here or in the bug tracker. Any assistance would be appreciated. We are looking forward to v2 of the app.",

Previously it was working fine but lately I noticed that files are not downloaded. When I start to download a file the Icon is changed, the real size of the file is shown but no notification or something shows me that the file is downloaded and no request if I what to open it appears. I saw that the file in fact is downloaded into app filepool directory but not into Downloads directory as it was previously. Is there any change in Moodle API that reflects to this download? And can I fix it in some way because I want to keep using this version of Moodle app. Thanks, Iglika",

Our auto-login feature isn't working. There are some restrictions to make it work: - The site must use https. - The user cannot be an admin. - There is a time limit for consecutive uses (by default, 6 minutes). This means that if you see a mod_hvp in the app with user A and then you see a mod_hvp in another device with the same user before 6 minutes have passed, the second one will not work as expected (you'll see the login page). We don't maintain the mod_hvp plugin, but a lot of sites are you using so I think it should work as expected in the app. IMO you should be able to make it work without migrating to the core h5p.

I debugged the app both on iOS and Android, both show a login form instead of the h5p content and if I debug the app in the Chrome inspection console I get two error messages: \n```text\nGET\n \nhttps://xxx.xxx/admin/tool/mobile/autologin.php?userid=\n... \n404 (Not found)\n```\n \n```text\nBlocked a frame with origin \n\"xxx.xxx\n\"\n from accessing a cross-origin frame\n```\n This is what I've checked so far : We use the core h5p plugin (not the mod_hvp) On our site everything is set as explained in the documentation ( allow frame mbedding enabled, etc.) Allow Cross-Website Tracking is set on iOS CORS header set in the root .htaccess file of our site (Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin \"*\") I really don't have a clue what else could be causing this embed issue...",

Based on the console you sent, it seems your site is returning a 404 for the autologin request. Can you please verify that the URL https://xxx.xxx/admin/tool/mobile/autologin.php can be accessed in your site? Maybe your server configuration is restricting the access. Cheers, Dani",

I had a meeting with our IT department and they've found a setting in our apache2 virtual host configuration which had the X-Frame-Options set to SAMEORIGIN , after commenting it out everything seems to be working again . That setting was probably overriding our .htaccess and all the other configurations on the server... Thank you for your help! Ivan",
