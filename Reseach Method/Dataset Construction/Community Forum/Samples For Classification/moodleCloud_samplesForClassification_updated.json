For now, significant steps have been made to allow for easier embedding of H5P content in any text area through the ATTO editor, and the filter to make sure the H5P content is displayed correctly in those text areas. I expect the mod_hvp to become part of Moodle core by 3.9 (May 2020), as can be read in the Developer's Moodle Docs : https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Roadmap",

I am really desperate that I have lost all of my moodle cloud , including the class I was running, because I have missed the upgrading/payment deadline. My students are left without a course and we have several submission deadlines coming up. I have a back-up of my course, except for all the forum discussions going on in the class. I have read in previous discussions that there could be a way to retrieve my content and put it back up on my cloud (which I have re-created through a subscription). Could you an admin please help me with that? Many thanks in advance, Marie",

I use a local installation of Moodle for my 'local' Uni teaching and Moodle Cloud for remote courses. Our local Uni Moodle uses TurnitIn, and I absolutely need a similar feature in Moodle Cloud (anything is better than nothing!). From the options you have mentioned, I know only TurnitIn. And I don't like it at all. At least the version we use - a separate activity - has no way to incorporate extensions (like user/group overrides), it does not accept Html files, there is no cutoff date, there is no marking workflow, there is no offline marking option, no marking groups, etc. A nightmare to use for larger classes. Anyway, from my perspective it would be absolutely the best to integrate plagiarism detection directly into Moodle assignment activity (and if possible into the quiz, for the essay questions). Would any of these plugins work that way? Thanks, Marcin",

The maintenance mode page is put in place to give students a nice page rather than an error when infrastructure work is required on MoodleCloud such as upgrades or more recently a database migration to ensure that the system was running on a supported and secure infrastructrure. This is why Admins can't turn off maintenance mode. Once the work is complete all sites should automatically be set back but on occasion one or two fail to do so. With 10s of thousands of sites its not always as easy as we would like to catch the ones that have not changed back. We are looking at improving monitoring to help mitigate this posibility futher.",

For the block, you can edit the Student role (under /admin/roles/manage.php) and \"prevent\" the capability \"block/online_users:viewlist\". I would probably set all capabilities relating to this block to \"prevent\" for Students at that point, since it's kind of useless. Let us know if there's something clearly MoodleCloud-specific for this, I'm curious. Otherwise, you would be better served by the original forum where you posted.",

We would like to send out weekly progress reports to all of our students to let them know which assignments they have completed and what they still need to complete. Currently, we manually e-mail every student individually. We run a course completion report and copy it into an e-mail to each student. This is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable as our registration numbers increase. I saw that there is a Participation Report where we can send a message for each assignment to students who have not completed the assignment. That means students who haven't started any assignments would get 26 e-mails, one for each of our assignments. That's not a great user experience. I saw the Pulse plug-in and believe that functionality is what we're looking for. However, we can't install plug-ins on MoodleCloud. Are there any options for us to automate sending out weekly progress reports? Or do we have to stick to doing it manually?",

But I will leave it here since one possible solution involves plugins which you can't add to Moodlecloud. There is no standard way to be certain that a student has completed one course before moving onto another. A popular workaround is mentioned in the Moodle documentation : Can I make access to a course conditional upon completing another? where basically you set up course B with an enrolment key and  in course A you use Restrict access and Activity completion to conditionally display the enrolment key in a Page once every activity in course A has been completed. This works, but if you have  a group of students who communicate with each other it would be easy for them to pass on the enrolment key to course B. But then - you would know - because the logs will show that they have not completed course A.",

Of course unless the courses contain text only, the likelihood of creating 2000 courses (and at the same time staying within your storage limit) is less likely. I hope that this helps. Kelly",

With the upgrade, any existing questions from the course context are automatically moved into a new ' [Course name] shared question bank.' Additionally, any quizzes in a course with questions also have their own dedicated question bank, and listed under 'Other activities with questions'.

But then after maybe 5 minutes, I get \"video source missing.\" (Note: Even if I post a link to a youtube video, it will look fine, and 5 minutes later will say \"video source missing.\" and the link I pasted in, will be gone.) At that point I can't do anything for the rest of the day, because the video I uploaded is taking up most of my free moodle disk space. The video file is still there. I see it in 'User Storage' when one clicks \"see all.\" But no way to delete it until something behind the scenes deletes it by the next day. So frustrating. And here's the other thing. That video which I can see in \"user storage\" doesn't match the size in MB of the file on my computer. The 98.4 MB file on my computer, uploaded to moodle is now 93.88 MB. Yet they should be identical. When I take that file name which I can see in 'user storage' (renamed by moodle into a series of letters and numbers) and try to paste it as a link into HP5 I get a message \"video format unsupported.\" At first I thought I was getting too close to my moodlecloud storage limit. But that's not the case because I'm monitoring that. Thanks in advance for anyone's help.",

Video is 2 minutes long. I could compress it down more, but I wonder where my threshold will be. Like will I be problem-free at 50 MB or 80 MB. Also because the hp5 module also threw out a test youtube link, maybe I've somehow corrupted the hp5 module and should start from scratch. Another thing I might explore is using JW Player on my own server storage space that comes with my email account. I tried yesterday to simply upload my video into my www space that comes with my email account, and then pasted that link into the hp5 module: but that didn't work. LOL. I realized a player is needed, not just the file. I understand it's a tall order for an LMS to also be a video hosting site. I'm going to keep trying to figure out a solution. I like the idea of large video files, because then the user could click the expand button to get full screen which for me is 1080p. But first I'll try to get something small working.",

Since you're asking the question in the MoodleCloud forum, I'll mention that moodlecloud.com offers managed Moodle hosting at a low cost, if you are fine with the limitations (user/disk limit, no custom themes & plugins). Otherwise, since your profile indicates you are in Portugal, I recommend you ask in the Portuguese forum https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=24 , they would be better placed to offer local advice.

The user cap is more fluid. There are no hardcoded user limits in BigBlueButton so the biggest factor is server specs and then client bottlenecks. For the current HTML5 client build I would recommend not going over 100 users in a meeting and to reach those numbers requires a server that is beyond the minimum specs in the documentation. We're trying to raise the number of users that the client can sustain, but it's an ongoing process. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bigbluebutton-users/6hjfvfWNAsY/fwnu_CeNCAAJ",

Otherwise.... I recently created a MoodleCloud site for the online school I'm building for use in the Dominican Republic. I have previous experience with Moodle however, have been away from the platform since 2012 and there have been a lot of changes. Now that I am back, I am finding the documentation to be as convoluted as before, if not more so. While I have found some information on making changes to the boost and classic themes by adding code to the raw scss, I have been unable to adequately identify which sections of the front page to adjust to bring my width in from full screen to only a percentage of the full screen. By that, I mean I want the background image to be full screen but the text boxes (card boxes?) to be a smaller width - similar to the login box on the login screen. I've been trying to identify which sections to adjust using the developer tools available with the Brave browser and have had some success changing the color for the free trial message that appears once you've logged in, but I haven't identified which css code to override on the front page when not logged in. I would also like to override the logo sizes. The default sizes are way too small. Any assistance you can provide is appreciated. Thank you, Mike",

I looked at the log and it shows thirteen events with the same timestamp (March 20, 2025, 10:34:40 PM) made by me, with the same IP address (the right one), in that section. All events are tagged \"course module update\". The number of events (thirteen) matches the number of items in the section. On that day, I actually worked in that course and in that section, but only to assess a quiz taken by my students last week. I'm sure I didn't make any changes to all the other items.

It used to be that you could choose to see all of your questions at once when you clicked to add a question, and not only pages of 20. Anyone know why they removed that?

We offer courses to our students and the current system (Filemaker) that we have give  student access to the module/subject only if they made their first payment. We are looking for a similar function on Moodle. We want the students to have payment invoices. The paid invoices must control the modules or subject in the course. For example lets say the student paid 1 invoice , they must have access to the first module/subject . No payment no access to the  module/subject. Also student must be able to have access to the next module if they only pay every second invoice, in other words making  1st payment , module/subject should be available to the student , 3rd payment = second module/subject , 4th payment = 3nd module/subject and so on. Should we continue using the payment system that we have and intergrate it with Moodle to get payment information or this can be done on Moodle.?",

          "Text": "Hi All, We're happy to announce that all MoodleCloud sites are now on Moodle 4.3.2! This latest release continues our ongoing journey of empowering our users, with improvements designed to help them unlock their creativity, help facilitate cooperation and optimise learning outcomes. MoodleCloud 4.3.2: New features Packed with many improvements and new features, here are the key highlights for Moodle 4.3 & 4.3.2 (see release notes for the full list and the Moodle 4.3 new features page for some screenshots): Activity Card Redesign. Educators and learners will appreciate the revitalised activity cards – now more compact and intuitive, ensuring seamless management of groups, restrictions, and activity completion conditions. Default activity completion. Courtesy of the Moodle Users Association’s valuable input, administrators and educators can now set default activity completion conditions at the site level. Course communications. The launch of our new integration with the Matrix Messaging system provides access to a contemporary messaging interface directly in the heart of Moodle. Additional functionality will make working with other messaging systems (e.g. Slack or Teams) more seamless in the future. These new in-course communication options will help educators and learners stay connected, foster increased engagement, and work more closely together! Other interesting features LTI external tools Report Builder Gradebook enhancements Security enhancements Question bank enhancements And much more! Thanks for using MoodleCloud and we hope you like the new features! Cheers, Frances MoodleCloud - Product Manager",

You can download Moodle from https://download.moodle.org/ You can perform a Site Export of your MoodleCloud site from the Portal by visiting https://moodlecloud.com and logging in using your site name and admin password, then going to Tools -> Export my site. You can restore your site export to the database on your home server and with a few minor tweaks of the provided config.php you will be up and running in no time. If you need help along the way be sure to check https://docs.moodle.org as we cannot provide support for sites hosted off the MoodleCloud platform.",

I can add files from Google Drive to Moodlecloud directly using the filepicker. What I would like to be able to do is to add them without the files being added to the file storage limit. I appreciate that I could just create a shareable link on Google Drive and copy/paste that into the Moodlecloud site but this seems to defeat the advantage of using GDrive as a repository. Is there something simple that I've missed - I thought it might be in the Internal/External/Internal and External options in the Repository settings but this seems to make no difference. cheers Colin",

Make sure to connect a \"System account\" (on the OAuth2 services page in Moodle). As explained on the \"Google Drive repository\" page (linked above), you should use a dedicated account for this purpose (this is the account that will keep a copy of your files on google drive). Depending if you are using an enterprise (vs personal) Google account, the screenshots might be different from what you get on the site, but the process is the same. Once this is all done, you may want to enable the Google auth, by following the documentation on https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/OAuth_2_authentication Mathieu",

The very special irony of Google Analytics is that Google doesn't have to do anything actively, it is you, the webmaster, who sends data on each click of your users to Google. So you are sending other's data to Google. The law is catching up with this abuse and it is on the way to become illegal. Even now the major browsers have mechanisms built-in to block this communication. This is too broad a topic, or rather a whole bag of issues, to be discussed here. But unavoidable we touch it many forums on moodle.org. Here is a random short explanation I found: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/50824/what-are-the-security-implications-of-using-google-analytics . Please inform yourself. Generally people don't like to be tracked. There are so many tools and methods to find out whether a site is tracking. So finally the tracking can back-fire depending on the awareness of your users. If you have the trust of users, why don't you collect data transparently? Everybody knows that each click is \"trackable\" if one is logged in.",

Some of our classes are multi-part and thus long, like [2 h lesson + 30 min break + 1 h lesson]. Sometimes, not regularly, we observe a message that the conference will be ended in NN minutes, and this message looks to appear in about 3 h after the conference is started. This issue is not reproducible on demand, it might not appear for months and then start to appear again. We'd like to have an ability to control it in some way, if this is possible. Any ideas? We are on MoodleCloud so can only access those configuration options that MoodleCloud allows. A thing that might correlate: our students are kids, and some parents login to a conference in advance, like in an hour or two, and leave the browser window open so kids could just switch to it at proper time. Could that play a role, and if yes, could we implement a kind of waiting room instead of direct connection to the conference room?",

          "Text": "Hi All, Thanks to everyone who participated in the MoodleCloud Users Survey in September this year. You were all very clear about what you wanted, so now your wishes are coming true! We are excited to let you know that we have just launched new MoodleCloud Plans, and they’re pack full of what you were asking for! New Large plan By far the most requested improvement was larger plans, and today we can announce the MoodleCloud Large Plan, with 1000 users and 5GB storage. New User Count that excludes Suspended users on all new plans For new plans, we’ve changed the way we count Users to something that is better value for you. For all MoodleCloud customers on one of the new plans launched this week, suspended users will no longer be counted in your user quota. This works much better than deleting users, as you will still have their data and will be able to run reports on what they’ve previously completed. Storage increases on all new plans We’ve increased the storage on all new plans, and more than doubled it on others! Starter: Was 200MB, now 250MB Mini: Was 200MB, now 500MB Small: Was 400MB, now 1,000MB Medium: Was 1,000MB, now 2,500MB Large: 5,000MB New Free Trials Everyone not yet using MoodleCloud will be able to start a 45 Day Free Trial that includes all features from all plans. We thought it seemed fair that you should be able to try it before you buy it! Ready to upgrade? You can upgrade your plan from any existing Starter and School plans to the new plans at any time (the system will automatically give you a pro-rata refund on any unused time in your old plan too)! If you do choose to move from a Moodle for School plan to one of our new MoodleCloud plans, please note that the following features are no longer available: School theme & school domain (sitename.moodle.school) MoodleCloud theme Group Choice Activity Level up! Quizventure We have more information on important changes to read before upgrading from Moodle School to the new Moodle LMS plans . Moodle School plans no longer available for purchase They were with us for five years, but we’ve finally decided to retire the old Moodle for School plans, and they are no longer available for purchase. You can retain your existing Moodle for School plan if you are already on it (we’re not requiring you upgrade at this time, although we’ll highly likely end these plans entirely when Moodle v4 comes out in early 2022). Thanks, and happy Moodling! Lee Goldsworthy Product Manager - MoodleCloud",

          "Text": "Thanks, Jon! The reason I posted here is to find out if someone is aware on how to edit theme's <head> element on a MoodleCloud site, no matter the reason. Btw , the <body> element is available to change - add tags, code, etc., but not the <head> from what i can see. Now, when it comes to my particular need to add a meta-tag in the head element, it is because i need this verification of the subdomain (nsd.moodle.school). Because otherwise I cannot leverage the full potential of Google API plugins. Forwarding an external, verified domain towards my MoodleCloud site will not solve this. Thanks for the comment, though. It seems i just won't be able to add this meta-tag.",

Might be worth asking in the MoodleCloud forum if they could add a special setting in the theme to allow that content without affecting head in general.",

          "Text": "Hi all, Thanks in advance for any help you can give me, I've been puzzled by this for a while. To get started, my understanding of css and scss is extremely limited to being able to find the element I want to change in the Inspector and muddling my way through until I get the desired result...so you know where my knowledge level is at. Scenario : I have built an e-learning site using Moodlecloud. The hardware and browser the site is going to be accessed from is a Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 running MS Edge. The User profile is locked down so I cannot use another browser, and I cannot change the hardware either. Issue : When I access the site using Edge on the Toughpad, the hamburger menu and the custom drop down menus do not work. If I tap on them a box appears around the outside of the menu item, but the side-drawer nor the drop-down menu shows. I have narrowed down the issue to the pseudo-class focus-within, which I have found here: https://mysite.com/theme/styles.php/boost/1652874062_1649605921/all (The site is hidden behind a login page so I'm not sure how useful sharing the link to the site would be?) And it looks like this: .dropdown-item:focus-within {outline:0;background-color:#EEBC1D;color:#fff}.dropdown-item:active a,.dropdown-item:hover a,.dropdown-item:focus a, .dropdown-item:focus-within a{color:#fff} I think I may have found a potential workaround here , but I have no idea how to implement this to affect the hamburger side-menu and my custom drop-down menus. This is an absolute deal-breaker, as aforementioned I cannot change the browser or the hardware. Any help would be much appreciated.",

MoodleCloud is a service offered by the people who make Moodle and they (we) set up a Moodle site online for you so you don't have to do the technical stuff and can just get on with teaching your class. There are longer answers and more details  but hopefully that helps. Also - I see you are currently in our Learn Moodle MOOC.

I'm wondering if anyone here can help with info on the matter. On Vimeo I have my videos uploaded as a \"Hidden from Vimeo\" video and the privacy setting to only allow for the videos to be embedded on approved domains. The only approved domain I have listed are my moodle pages \"_____. MoodleCloud .com\". After copying and pasting the embed code from the Vimeo video into the Moodle \"Page\" source under HTML5 I get a notification from the Vimeo player \"Sorry Because of its privacy settings, this video cannot be played here.\" I checked Vimeos information boards and found this: \"If you’re seeing this error in the player, the video you are watching has domain -level privacy enabled. The video’s owner can adjust the domains where a video can appear within “Where can this video be embedded?” section of the embed settings page. If the domain is listed in your video settings page, but the error is still appearing, the domain specified in your address bar may be different from the domain sent to the Vimeo player. In these cases, the privacy error may appear. Contact a web developer to confirm if there is anything in your site's HTML code that could be blocking the referrer from reaching our player iframe.\" Is the HTML player reporting a different domain back to Vimeo? I am using a trial version of moodle to evaluate Moodles efficacy for the task. Will this issue persist after I move from the trial version to the paid version of Moodle? Is there a way to have my site report the proper URL back to Vimeo to reach the player iframe? Thanks in advance for any insight, Josh P.S. I'm new to the forum so if I posted in the wrong thread let me know and I will remediate the issue.",

From the information supplied it seems you are listing a domain that is not specific, so you are telling Vimeo it can accept any subdomain, but Vimeo does not work in this way, you need to list the exact website URL . In our experience this worked the best.",

It's unlikely at this time that such an integration would\nbe made available on MoodleCloud right away. Note that Moodle is free software, you can host it yourself. You could then use any modules you like, though I'll admit that's not a quick and easy task to complete and deploy. Mathieu",

For example, a bounce might occur if the user's email address is either invalid or the mailbox is full or unavailable (even an \"out-of-office reply\" has triggered this bounce). This information is supplied by AWS (Amazon Web Services), who we use to host all MoodleCloud sites and deliver site related emails. MoodleCloud appends a user's email with \".invalid\" when AWS tells us the email address bounces. This is automated to avoid repeated attempts to send an email that is bouncing back. You can manually remove \".invalid\" from the users' email addresses in your site and this should resolve the issue, unless the user's mailbox does not accept the email. The user should also check their email filters to make sure they accept (and not automatically reject) the email notifications from your MoodleCloud site. If your users use an institutional email, check your organisation's email server for filters that may have been applied that detect the email is from AWS/bulk email, and reject it.

This doesn't resolve the issue for learners, but did resolve the issue for staff. The main issue was that users aren't told that they are no longer going to receive emails, they just stop. So staff members missed assignments being handed in, and other announcements. We then do a monthly check on learners who have had .invalid added to their email address and see if something has changed. 98% of the time they have had an out-of-office on which has caused a bounce back.",

We are now at that time but the usage does not appear to be readily aavaiable. We have over the last month moved the installation to another PC thinking it might be a configuration compatibility issue but achieved the same results. We are considering upgrading to the Moodle cloud for school edition but fear that we will encounter the same issue (if all packages contain the same plugins across the platform). Our question i thought was simple, does Moodle Cloud support Respondus 4.0 and if so, under which pricing plan? Or, has anyone in the Moodle Cloud Forum experienced the same problem and if so, how did they resolve it?",

The Moodle for Schools plan doesn't offer the Respondus connectivity, I'm afraid. See the last line \"Plug-in and theme installation\" in https://moodlecloud.com/app . Also \"mouse-over\" the question mark there. But there is no reason for panic. Taking a Moodle site from one server to another is quick (for the routined). It is called https://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_migration . If you upgrade you Moodle to a Moodle Partner they will handle that for you. They are the same company. It is worth clarifying with your content providers whether the Respondus component is a must. Moodle has a complete work-flow in itself for on-line exams, from the very simple ones to higher education. No programming is necessary. Neither does the Open Source component Safe Exam Browser I mentioned. It is a stripped-down browser and a kiosk system for the students computers to restrict many ways of cheating.",

Even when using a partner there are several issues to deal with, such as lack of tech support and communication issues. My question is, what is the ultimate goal of Moodle Cloud ? Is it to essentially to do away with Moodle Hosting? In the near future, will Moodle Hosting be a thing of the past? Will Moodle Cloud eventually cost money? I am all for moving away from Moodle Hosting partners and going directly through Moodle Cloud when it becomes powerful enough. Just wondering if I am on the right track with this assumption.

The goal of MoodleCloud is to help as many users as possible get started with a Moodle site. It's a service that allows anyone to experience Moodle within minutes and helps users build a Moodle site to a certain level (500 users and 1Gb of file storage). As we offer limited support, we feel once you get to that level, you are ready for that next step and Moodle Partners can offer a more tailored solution and provide the necessary support and assistance for hosting a large site. As Tim mentions, the flexibility of Moodle means you can shape the solution that's right for you and choosing an appropriate hosting option is part of this. So it's likely that Moodle hosting will continue to will come in many shapes and sizes from many providers. Thanks Chris",

Also, I'll point out that this is only in the new HTML5 client, which (on LInux at least) I can only access from Firefox. Mathieu",

We've been running upgrades on and off for the past few days to deploy some additional server capacity and this will certainly be the cause of these delays. We should be finished with these upgrades before end of day today and all outbound emails will catch up. Sorry for the impact here (we do try to minimise these events as much as possible), but I think this draws attention to how we could better communicate when there are known delays to outbound emails (such as getting this information up on status.moodlecloud.com). I'll pick this up with the team. Thanks! Lee Goldsworthy Product Manager - MoodleCloud",

If ReadSpeaker (or any other plugin) is essential for your business, you will need to use Moodle LMS .

I have tried contacting Moodle and the local authorized team however no one has gotten back to me and it has been months. I am using the MoodleCloud theme School. My Admin block is missing. I cannot add it as a block. I am able to access it through admin home page - Site Administration. However even when I try to configure the block - where this block appears, my only options are: any site administration page or the current site administration page. When I go directly to the link, it says link ....admin/index.php?sesskey=LIATdkHcTp&bui_editid=5, it says its unknown. Lastly, even if I change themes, I cannot add it/configure it. I am at an utter loss. I have learned to work around it temporarily but now I have a huge clean up to do and I cannot let the teachers reset their own courses since I am the only one who can access the block through admin homepage.

On the mini-package, if we record a class session with bigbluebutton, where will this recording be saved? Will the saved file count towards the File Storage limit of 200mb? 2. As our class sessions are 90 minutes long, am pretty sure that any video recording will exceed 200MB, has anyone encountered this issue, and can you advise what to do to work around it? 3. We may run concurrent classes at the same time, and will require concurrent Web-conferencing sessions. Can anyone advise how many sessions could we run at the same time? 4. Is the file storage limit of 200MB site-wide for all users? It seems very low and easy to hit the limit. Thank you!",

In any case, Moodle allows for extensive use of 3rd-party hosting services (Google drive, Dropbox, etc.) and can embed content from Youtube and other video hosting sites. I recommend taking advantage of these features to save on disk space. Looking forward to seeing your site on MoodleCloud! Mat",

Well till last May I worked well, and the editor worked well for me and I used it nicely. Now (November) I noticed some significant changes in the Moodle GUI (although the theme is always the same: the Moodlecloud theme). No problem, the new GUI is nice too. But using the HTML editor is another thing. The font display size is too small for me to write easily: the paragraph style is 5 pixels high (height of the lowercase x letter). This is simply too much small for me. I've an 1920x1080 display too. Also, the <h5> headers, which I often use, are only 4 pixels high! Those sizes are shown to me only in the editor: when my students open the page I wrote, they see the paragraphs of 8 pixels high (lowercase letters) which is OK for them.

It confuses many first time users, particularly if they are not particularly computer literate.  I think it is overly intimidating without the ability to at least presenting a screen that explains what they will see next and what they need to do. Alternatively, it would be nice to, like many software providers, have a less intrusive way for users to accept the EULAs without having to physically scroll down each and click accept. So my question is if there is currently a way for organizations that use Moodle as a platform for delivering content to allow for adjustments to the default way new users see the Moodle EULAs, and if so, where can I find documentation on that?

In Moodle's 'FAQ' page, it is said, \"MoodleCloud paid plans, recordings are made available for 1 year after the session has finished.\" Can't I have my recordings for an unlimited lifetime as long as I'm extending my Moodle paid plan? What do I need to do? Thank you. <",

Your BigBlueButton recordings are kept for 7 days on a free Trial account, and 365 days on any paid plan. You can have up to 100 students in a BigBlueButton conference, and up to 8 in each breakout room. See https://bigbluebutton.org/teachers/ for details of how BigBlueButton can be used to connect teachers and students in real time. Visit the BigBlueButton community pages for support: https://bigbluebutton.org/support/community/ For more information on the Moodle BigBlueButton plugin go to https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_bigbluebuttonbn If you need recordings to be downloaded you can either use software like Zoom Meetings, or you can move to a self-hosted installation or Moodle Partner hosting, where the BigBlueButton sessions can be downloaded. I hope this helps.",

All I want is to educate the visitors to my site about our self, services we provide, Terms and Conditions etc. Just like on any other wordpress website. I was pondering, should we make a guest login and prompt the user to enter the site using that; and using Label resource add text and multimedia content. This way the content will be visible to the visitors. But, problem with this is, there is too much content and it will not be organised and presented well with this solution. Another aspect: Not everyone will be familiar with the icons we use in Moodle. So adding our content within a particular resource for example, book or page, or making a course to educate them about us, and asking them to go thru it, will perhaps be quite contrary to what I am thinking. Let's see. Thanks once again.",

Infrastructure Uptime - We have succeeded in keeping all services up during this period by staying one step ahead of the hard bottlenecks that would have otherwise caused outages at specific threshholds of users/sites. This has been our focus (to the exclusion of all else) over the last 10 days. 2. Infrastructure Performance - We have not succeeded in maintaining fast page load times during this period (as this has been secondary to #1 above). We are now at the final stages of testing and expect to add capacity for more sites and concurrent users in the EU and US regions today and tomorrow. We expect these upcoming changes to substantially improve performance to usual page load times, but until then, users in EU and US regions will see slower page load times during their local business hours peak times. 3. Customer Support - We have not succeeded in maintaining our usual ticket respond/resolve times during this period. We have added support staff to the MoodleCloud team and are training them as we speak to assist with bringing down support ticket respond/resolve times. I understand this experience is challenging for you at a time when you need Moodle most, and for that I would like to apologise. Please know that the MoodleCloud team are doing everything we can right now to get back to providing a great service to you, and to the 20,000+ new schools and businesses that have signed up to MoodleCloud in the last 10 days alone. Hit me up below if you have any questions or concerns, I'd love to hear them. Cheers Lee Goldsworthy Product Manager - MoodleCloud",

All the accounts have already been created before (with the same file, but without the country and timezone columns). I am attempting to only update. In the upload settings I have: Upload type - Update existing users only Existing user details - Override with file Existing user password - No changes Allow renames - No Allow deletes - No etc... After clicking 'Upload users' I am getting 0 errors, but the country and timezone remain unchanged. Does anybody know what I am doing wrong? Thanks, Marcin",

Moodle can cache themes, language strings, filters and other bits of information that have been calculated and stored by the web browser. This link forces all user web browsers to refresh their screens of any information that Moodle has cached. Several modules that use cache have settings which will turn off caching for that module. Eliminating or purging caches slows performance. For more information, check out Purge all caches: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Developer_tools#Purge_all_caches You might also want to double check that all the fields in the CSV are valid. You can find more information here: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Upload_users#User_Fields_that_can_be_included I hope that this helps and you are able to update. Kelly",

While I use limits of my paid Moodlecloud account for my regular courses, I also want to deliver some free webinars. For that, I created single-activity/BigBlueButton course and a kind of 'guest' account that only has an access to this course. As I have limit of 50 users in BigBlueButton session, I expect that up to 49 visitors (plus me as a 'teacher') could login with this account simultaneously and participate in BBB session. I tested this locally, joining BBB session from four devices under this 'guest' login. Sometimes this works. Sometimes however I can't login and receive a message that this account is logged in already and should logout first. This message seems to happen randomly. Is there a better way to provide guest access to BBB session?",

As a course teacher, go to Course administration > Reports > Event monitoring rules, or as an admin go to Site administration > Reports > Event monitoring rules. Event Monitoring If you are trying to send notifications on enrolment, please note that you are only able to do this on self enrolment method and you are unable to edit this email. You can however step up notifications of enrolment expirations. Please note that notifications do not go out for at least 30 minutes in Moodle, but even after that, it does depend on when your cron runs for your site. You can view the setting here: Site administration > Security > Site security settings > Maximum time to edit posts. Which reduces that 30 minute wait time, but ultimately it still depends on when cron runs for your site and if you have a MoodleCloud site, this is run by us here at Moodle HQ. You can find the details of when the cron last ran for your MoodleCloud site on the System status page:",

A common practice I've seen in Moodle and other LMS is to post a short video/text at the top of the course to orientate students to the course structure and expectation, this generally needs to be somewhat customised to the course content or structure. Larger institutions tend to try and standardise to some extent the course formats which can help in that regard",

          "Text": "Hello, I have recently come across a tool called Wobo which basically allows you to integrate a digital workbook into your LMS. It looks great in lots of ways but is still quite new and unfortunately does not integrate perfectly with Moodle yet. As a small-ish charity we also don't have the funds to spend a monthly amount on it (even though it is very reasonably priced). I'm just wondering whether there is any way of creating a similar type of acvitiy directly in Moodle, on the MoodleCloud server . The kind of course which we run is one where students are required to: - complete self-assessment forms, which they may want to refer back to over the course of the programme - create action plans, which, again, they will need to refer back to, potentially make changes to, etc. - keep track of their progress by rating themselves on a scale for various parameters. Over time, this rating should improve, and they should be able to see this improvement The \"Feedback\" activity type does not work for these kinds of activities , because once submitted, participants cannot see their responses. The only work-around I have come up with so far is to ask them to download , complete and submit a worksheet as an \"Assignment\" activity, but this feels clumsy and I would really like these activities to be integrated. An online workbook like Wobo seems to be the ideal solution, but as I say, Wobo itself is not quite there yet. Does anyone know of a similar tool, or a good work-around on Moodle?",

This course will give at the end, after a final examination, the possibility to get a certificate issued by the local authority (Ministry) to start your own activity in Slovakia. The classroom has usually between 7 and 15 students. We have just 1 teacher so we run just a training session at one time. The course has a theoretical and a practical part so i can imagine a wide use of camera during the practical part. We have been investigating Moodle and i would like to ask you about your opinion; do you think it could fit to our needs ? We would like to move to a cloud based solution; we understood Moodlecloud has almost the same features of the on-premise installation (and less installation and technical stuff to setup, it seems to us much easier to get-it-ready). Is there something we should consider before making our decision on a moodlecloud solution ? Thanks in advance for your kind support Regards, Massimo",

I was going to point to the previous discussion in https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=353376 but I see Gil has already posted in that one, without much luck. Looking at that previous discussion, I don't think this issue is specific to MoodleCloud, so maybe it's time for a new issue on Moodle's bug tracker . I'm not a OneDrive user myself, but if one of you could precisely write, on the tracker, the steps taken and the errors encountered, it might help debug this issue and resolve it for everyone.

The \"Thinking\" course category doesn't have a course called \"Shared teaching...\" 3. The top level category of Thinking has a course called \"Shared teaching...\". But that has only 6 questions that came from somewhere else. 4. When I click into a quiz activity which used the shared question bank on Thinking level with randomized questions, the following error message comes up: \"Coding error detected, it must be fixed by a programmer: Unsupported context . More information about this error\". Interestingly, I can still review old attempts and make new attempts. 5.

There is a limitation to the file storage (400MB) in my current MoodleCloud Plan. Given that there is a limit imposed, it is necessary and critical to give customers the option and ability to housekeep and delete the uploaded files so that we can stay within the limits. Imposing a file storage limit, and not giving customers the ability to delete files is illogical and a major inconvenience. I hope there is a plan in place to allow customers the ability to delete the files manually, is this in the roadmap for implementation in the near term (within the next 3 months)? Thanks, David",

I know there isn't much support on moving from MoodleCloud to a local instance.  Got all of it taken care of, just curious in anyone had some info on the password section.  Thank you kindly in advance. -Jeff",

As your reply suggests, it seems there's a lot of fuzziness in this area---it may/may not work, but in either case Moodle can't help. I also haven't found any Moodle partners that offer support just for MoodleCloud, you have allow them to build your Moodle site and/or host with them.

Will they still have access until they go online again, or will their access stop the same day subscription is suspended (if it isn't paid). Having all the facts will help prioritise decision making. Thanks. Jessica",

I suggest you turn the wifi & data connection off on your phone and see what works and what doesn't once you're \"offline\". I am unfortunately not sure if the app reacts differently in the case where the connection is not \"offline\", but the site is suspended. Either way, I would strongly suggest you download both a course backup from your site, and a full site export from the MoodleCloud portal (under the \"Tools\" tab in the portal). Mathieu",

To keep the platform simple and stable for all users we do not allow you to install your own plugins at this time. You might want to consider if H5P will do this for you. H5P is a plugin that is included for free in all our MoodleCloud sites. There is a list of all available content types here: https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications I wonder if this particular one might do what you require: https://h5p.org/speak-the-words-set The plugin list will grow and continue to be updated. So if MoodleCloud currently does not support the particular plugin you are after, we will record your plugin request and other feedback to inform future work and additions to the system. If however, you require this plugin to be installed immediately for your MoodleCloud site, I can pass you onto your Moodle Partners to discuss your custom needs. Please note that if you want to have plugins added to your site, you will need to move to a Moodle site hosted by our Moodle Partners or a self-hosted site.",

However, there is some good news.  We are about to include some changes to how BigBlueButton works with MoodleCloud in the 3.4 Moodle release. This will include some exciting changes to the number of users per session included on your site and how you can get more users. We are working hard on getting this to all MoodleCloud sites in the next 2 weeks.  So If you can wait for these hopefully it will give you what you need. I can't give you the exact details yet, however there will be an email to account admins explaining all the changes, so keep an eye on your inbox. You are able to use other conferencing software on MoodleCloud, however it won't integrate as well as BigBlueButton. Thanks Chris",

I have used a hosted Moodle LMS for several years as a trainer, so I'm now looking for functionality that I'm familiar with in MoodleCloud. I have set a course up - this went very easily. I am now trying to enrol test students. I created a student using the \"Enrol Users\" button, I set the new user up as a student. An email was sent to the new student's address. It contains the Welcome text that I created. And nothing else. I was expecting the initial email to the student to contain a link to the course that I just enrolled him in, with options to create a password etc. This link is missing. How do I add the first signin link to a new student's welcome email? Many thanks, Ian",

I understand that I can suspend users who no longer need access, so will they still be counted against that limit? Can I continue seeing information of suspended users from past courses, or will they be deleted entirely? These are plans I'm referring to: https://moodlecloud.com/app/en/?_ga=2.247390788.150636622.1601323116-1564104232.1601323116 Many thanks, and I would greatly appreciate any insights or links to more information.

In our new 'MoodleCloud plans' (these are plans purchased or upgraded after November 200 and have a xxx.moodlecloud.com URL ) you are able to suspend users so they don’t count towards your quota, but you’ll still have their data and will be able to run reports on what they’ve previously completed. The suspend user feature has always been there but it's on the new plans we have been able to change the way the user count works to not count suspended users towards the user limit. This means that suspended users will still count towards your user quota if you are on a Moodle for School plan or a lone of our older MoodleCloud Plans . If you are unsure what plan you are on, you can find out in your MoodleCloud Portal. You are welcome to upgrade to our new Plans at any time, so that you can access this feature from your Portal. We have updated the FAQ to reflect this information. If you do choose to move from a Moodle for School plan to one of our new MoodleCloud plans, please note that the following features are no longer available: School theme & school domain (sitename.moodle.school) MoodleCloud theme Group Choice Activity Level up! Quizventure However you continue to have access to xxx.moodle.school (it will just redirect to xxx.moodlecloud.com). I hope that this helps. Kelly",

We are currently on the 100-user package and it is estimated in about 3 to 4 months' time we will hit the 100% quota. Courses run by us are not long - 3 months to 6 months on the average. And some students will not continue with us after they have finished their chosen courses though they can opt to continue with other related courses. Can we delete such students from our users database and re-use the empty slots without breaking the courses that these students were enrolled in (in terms of grades and contributions from such deleted students)? Or would all information (grades & contributions) of such students be wiped clean as well? Would appreciate guidance on this so that we can make decision whether to increase the quota when the time comes. Thank you.",

Not knowing what's in that scorm file, it's hard to suggest other things, but sometimes it's possible to host some bigs files (often videos) elsewhere and have the scorm file link to these ressources. I know this breaks the \"self-encapsulation\" of the scorm package, but it could make it possible to use MoodleCloud for you. Mat",

          "Text": "Hi all, We have an old training module on our web server that is built on an old version of Moodle (2.61) and it apparently requires an older version of PHP than what is running on our server today. I am wondering if I could just migrate it to moodle cloud to get it up to speed.  Is it possible to migrate an existing legacy moodle instance to the cloud and work on it there? Or c an I configure a Moodle cloud account to accommodate this older version of the training module?  Specifically run an old version of PHP to accommodate an older version of Moodle?  As I write this I am thinking this is probably not possible as it is probably some kind of shared hosting, but I am hoping that using the cloud version will be an easier environment to updgrade it to ver 3.7. Thoughts on migrating an old Moodle app to the Moodle Cloud? Hopefully I am making sense and thanks for any help you can give me. - Joe",

As you found out, since Moodle 2.6.1 does not support php 7, you will have a hard time finding a commercial host that will offer you this service. At this point, you can contact a Moodle Partner (find yours on https://moodle.com/partners/ ) to ask for support. They should be able to provide help. Otherwise, if you have a backup of your course, you can try to upload it into a MoodleCloud site  and see how things go­. If you do not use contrib modules, your content should be upgraded and work in the up-to-date Moodle version MoodleCloud provides. Let us know how it goes, Mathieu",

To explain - we are developing a child protection training, during which, at the end of each module, participants will produce a part of a child protection policy. e.g. in Module 1 they will be asked to describe the laws around child protection in their country, and to put this information into a \"feedback\" activity. By the end of the training, they will have filled in lots of these \"feedback\" activities and by doing so, will have written most of their Child Protection Policy. Is there a way of extracting the information that they give and collating it into one document? Ideally into a pre-existing template where their responses get slotted in at the appropriate points? If not, is there a work-around which would achieve the same results? Thanks!",

You will need to develop a custom report/function to collect al the responses from the user in that course and place it in one document for you. Seeing that Moodle already has the responses and information, I cannot see why this will be too difficult to develop. The bigger issue now is that you are on Moodle Cloud and it does not allow any custom development. You will need to host the site yourself or ask a certified Moodle partner to host it and help develop this for you. I work for AOSIS, a South African Moodle partner and we can help with both the option I mentioned.",

Depending on how mature they are, the students might like or dislike shifting a summary of their work from the (detailed) courses to this central course. The plus side is, the students do it themselves, you the teachers, don't have to copy things between courses.",

Be mindful that you have to select whether to include student data etc when you create the backup. If you don't select it then it won't be in the Backup. You visit each individual course and click on Settings, then Backup to create the Backup. You will need to go to  go to \"Site Admin/Server Files\" and find the automated backup there and download it to your computer. Once you have signed up for a MoodleCloud site then go to Site Admin / Courses/ Restore Course to upload that file and Restore.

Under our free site retention policy, if your Moodle for Free site has been inactive for more than 14 days, it is removed in order to maintain a vibrant and active system for all users. We do send a reminder email message before the site is removed. To get the site back online, we are able to restore your site data but as this is performed by our technical team there is a fee of $100.00 AUD. Also, please note that to comply with our GDPR policies, as you are no longer as a customer, you will need to reply to this email for us to go ahead with the site restore within 14 days of the site deletion date or your site will be deleted from our systems. Your other option is to recreate your site. You can do this in the MoodleCloud Portal or by completing the signup. Unfortunately, the content of the site has been deleted. To ensure it does not get removed in the future you need to make sure it is accessed regularly or you can choose to upgrade your site to a Starter or Moodle for School plan where the inactive policy does not apply. I shall send you a PayPal invoice to the registered address and if you do decide to go ahead with the site restore then we will action this restore for you. If you have any further questions, please let me know or visit our FAQ page. Also, it's worth a gentle reminder that in order to retain your restored site you will need to login every 14 days. With that in mind, we recommend that you upgrade to a Paid Subscription (starting from $80 depending on which Plan you select). With a Paid Subscription there is no regular requirement to log in every 14 days.",

How it works is that each student or user will need to create an account first.

For this reason, the best solution would be what you had suggested, creating a duplicated course instance with a different enrolment price. I hope this information helps.

MoodleCloud Starter only provides the \"custom certificate\" extra plugin and does not allow installation of custom themes or plugins (which is possible when self-hosting). You can view the list of extra plugins on https://moodlecloud.com/app/en/ , by clicking on the \"+\" sign right of \"Extra plugin pack\". A list with more detailed descriptions is available on https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=80 - note that most of them are only available on \"school plans\" (which are available to anyone, don't let the name confuse you). Since MoodleCloud offers a free tier from which you can later upgrade, I would suggest you get started with it. You can later export your courses and import them into your self-hosted site if you wish. Hopefully this helps make sense of it. Mathieu",

          "Text": "Dear Enrique, You will need to delete the files from every location that they are located in. If it is assignment files you are trying to delete, unfortunately you cannot leave an assignment submission with no file after one has been submitted. This is a known problem in Moodle with a very long history in our issue tracker. There are a few ways you can work around this: Wait until your course has finished, export the grades if you need to save them and then reset the course - this removes all data that was in the course (including files). OR In the file picker, remove the PDF and upload a small dummy file (empty text file will do) and then save that as the students submission. An empty text file should only be a few bytes in size compared to the several megabyte PDF. I know this isn't ideal, but this assignment submission file handling comes from Moodle itself and is not specific to the MoodleCloud environment. Please note that, the cron clear up runs daily so these deleted documents may appear to be still there but if you leave it and don't check on it for a day or so, they will be deleted. If you continue to check on the files, it creates drafts and prolongs the deletion of the files. I hope that this helps. Warm regards, Kelly",

Because now in the free version, I cannot do it. 3) If i take the mini or small option, can my classes be still available on the net in 10 or 50 years time or the account will expire ? The question is: If in 2 years time I want to opt for the normal Moodle and quit moodlecloud to give my classes, but i want to keep the moodlecloud version, can I still access to it ,if I do not pay anymore ? thank you very much in advance, Best margherita maria de lorenzi",

There is no need to move/rebuild what you have - everything stays as it is Since I work full-time on MoodleCloud, I sure hope it will still be online in 10 or 50 years, but there are unfortunately no guarantees about it. On a Moodle level, courses from 10 years ago can definitely still be restored in Moodle nowadays, so that's already a good thing. I feel this is a discussion as much about formats you use in your course as it is about the platform itself. In both cases, \"I sure hope so and I'll do my best to make it happen\" is the best I can say. You can definitely load videos in a free MoodleCloud site (though the space is limited). For both of these questions (videos and access control), since they are not MoodleCloud-specific, I strongly recommend you ask in the relevant support forum (have you tried the Assistance technique and Assistance pédagogique ?).

Only 1 course is designed to be self-directed without teacher facilitation. I am trying to sell this enrollment via a button on my website (or QR code). I have set up enrolment on payment within moodlecloud and in the individual course. I h ave set up Paypal business. Now, how do I connect them, so that when someone pays from a paypal button (or QR code) on an independent website an auto-enrollment is generated per the enrollment on payment settings? The whole idea is to not have to manually enter the information and for users to have <nearly> immediate access to the moodle course. Adding that at moment students only see the courses they are enrolled in. If they do enter the specific URL for the paycourse, they are invited to pay, so that part works. I cannot be the only one with this issue -- I recall that several years ago, I did a small course for a group that set up an automatic enrolment on payment using paypal in this manner but now, post-pandemic, I cannot find them.

          "Text": "I'm using Moodlecloud to design a 6 week course. The course encourages participants to take part in some exercises each week and to set a goal which they can aim to achieve over the six weeks of the course. I want to create a function through which participants can set a goal at the beginning of the course and then come back to review/reflect on it (and even edit/add to it) throughout the course. However, I'm struggling to find a function that suits this on Moodlecloud. For example, the Feedback option is good for open entry text but participants cannot review it after they've submitted it. I've also considered using the Quiz option. This works well in terms of function but the language is misleading since it refers to things like 'quiz', 'result' and 'assessment', which are not relevant. I read that you can change this language under 'language administration', but when I try I see a message saying \"this feature is not available in MoodleCloud.\" I also read about other plugin options to help with customisation, or options such as the journal plugin - but it would seem these aren't available with Moodlecloud either? My questions are: 1. Am I missing some steps that would make the above options work with MoodleCloud? If so, what are they? 2. If these options don't work with MoodleCloud, is anyone aware of alternative ways I could create this goal-setting function? I basically just need them to be able to type in a goal and be able to refer to it throughout the course. Is it possible to code within MoodleCloud? Also just to note I'm working on behalf of an organisation so don't have control over what type of account they have. Thank you.",

          "Text": "Source: https://moodle.com/news/publishing-moodle-course-mean/ Good morning everyone, This is exactly what we are hoping to achieve. We currently have a free trial and that might be where the problem is. We are planning on paying for a subscription; are we able to share courses with the public while on a free trial? A little background; we are a digital curriculum company for CTE related courses. We would like to share our curriculum with our Moodle customers. We would be importing our Thin Common Cartridge (Thin CC) files and hopefully sharing our courses so that our customers can copy them. Would this be the best method? Right now however I am not able to find the \"Share\" button; can anyone shed some light on where I have messed up? Thank you again for your time and please have a great day, Thomas",

          "Text": "Hi all, We are committed to providing open source, free e-learning tools for educators. That’s why all our software is free and open source, and this will never change. Hundreds of thousands of institutions have downloaded and are using Moodle on their own servers worldwide. MoodleCloud is one of our official hosting services that makes it simple for anyone to get a Moodle site without needing to install it on a local server .  Since 2015, MoodleCloud has provided a number of simple packages for smaller users, including a 50-user Free plan with 200Mb. Announcement 1: New free trial with larger quotas We are happy to announce the launch of a new MoodleCloud Free Trial with four times more users (200) and double the storage (400 MB). Everyone will be able to use their MoodleCloud Free Trial for 45 days before deciding to move to one of our inexpensive paid plans. Announcement 2: NGO and nonprofits program As part of our mission we are now offering our larger MoodleCloud plans completely free to registered NFPs and NGOs. All you need to do is apply here , and if accepted, we will give you a full-size MoodleCloud plan for no cost. Costs are subsidised by donations we've received. Does this replace the existing free plan? Yes! This new Free Trial upgrades and replaces our old Free plan (that expires if unused for 14 days). Will people keep their existing MoodleCloud free sites? Yes! Sites currently on the old Free plan will remain unchanged (so long as you use them at least once every 14 days!). Your support is welcome If you, or someone you know, would like to make a donation towards paying for deserving institutions to have free MoodleCloud sites, please visit moodle.com/donations . Thanks, and happy Moodling!

This week I did not have time to log in and seemed to have missed the small window you are allowed. So now I go to log in and my password doesn't work and there is no RESET or Forgot password button.  It gives me a choice for the various accounts (Free and Paid). When I \"sign up\" again for a new account - since using my current account no longer works - I am allowed to use my old site name/ URL and \"claim\" it.  When I do all that, what I get is the site name but the content is gone!  Anyone else have this experience?  How can I retrieve the course content? I can't believe it is actually gone. Not sure who to email?  Thanks!!",

After looking into the issue, we found that the main reason for the slowdown was the very high demand on our shared Infrastructure from multiple quizzes with thousands of users running simultaneously. This unexpected surge in activity has then affected the performance of some other sites. Our technical team have identified the problem, and we’ve since implemented changes to increase the overall capacity for all clients and mitigate further impacts to our infrastructure. We’re monitoring the issue and continuing to implement further changes to improve performance. We know how important consistent service is for your experience, and we take this very seriously. We hope that the increased infrastructure will mitigate the issue and will be continuing to monitor over the coming days. If you're still encountering any problems or need assistance getting back up and running smoothly, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our support team. Kind regards, Frances",

You can learn more about it below: Event Monitoring If you are trying to send notifications on enrolment, please note that you are only able to do this on self enrolment method and you are unable to edit this email. You can however step up notifications of enrolment expirations. You can learn more about below: Self enrolment: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Self_enrolment Manual enrolment: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Manual_enrolment Course enrolment: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_enrolment Please note that notifications do not go out for at least 30 minutes in Moodle, but even after that, it does depend on when your cron runs for your site.",

However, this may be a misunderstanding. It sounds like the $230 figure comes from the reference pricing shown in US Dollars on our pricing page . It’s important to note that MoodleCloud plans are billed in Australian Dollars (AUD) . For customers outside Australia, the amount charged in local currency will vary depending on exchange rates set by banks or card providers. Currently, the Mini plan is 340 AUD per year , which is approximately 230 USD at today’s exchange rate. This plan will increase to 380 AUD per year starting 13th August 2025 . We hope this helps clarify things! All the best, Christian",

You can also Export your MoodleCloud site , which will give you a zip file, which can be used to set up a Moodle site on another server . While this method will give you everything at once (courses, files, users, settings, etc.), it will require you know how to import a (possibly large) sql file into your server and move the files to the correct dataroot folder manually.

(but the reverse case would work: https tools can be used on http moodle instances, but I digress) You are correct, moodle cloud doesn't offer an option to disable SSL/https. Even if it did, you would not want to because of the security risk that would pose to your site. Basically, https on your cloud instance ensures that all content is encrypted and verifiably from your site. But if an http tool is used on that site, the content from that tool would not be encrypted, which would allow attackers to gain access to information about your users passed over LTI requests. So all modern browsers will not allow http content (such as LTI) on an https site. So your best option is to contact the provider of your tool and ask them to start using SSL on their site so you can use it via https. This is in their best interests as well as it protects all their clients' data. SSL certificates are cheap these days, and the extra processing power required is not really a problem. If you haven't already you might want to just double check that the tool is definitely not already working when you use https instead. If the tool provider really refuses to start using SSL, your do have the option is create a proxy server on top of their tool which allows you to send the LTI requests via https and then forward them to the original tool. But I would recommend leaving that as your last option",

It’s great that Moodle can generate completion reports for each course. But what we need to be able to do is have Moodle generate completion reports across multiple or in our case all courses. There is a plugin that I think gives us this ability but it is not accessible to Moodlecloud . ( https://moodle.org/plugins/report_completionoverview ) Is the only way to generate these reports to buy a version of Moodle that allows this? If so what would the best version be and how much would that cost? Lastly are they any other options we could take into consideration for this issue? In addition we would like to generate  a report to see all courses a single user has taken. Hopefully this all makes sense. I’d be happy to try and better explain if need be!

As the subject says, my Moodlecloud website was deleted due to inactivity because I had to stop teaching the children I homeschool since I had a research project that had to be finished (University Student here btw ). By the time I was done with my research, physical distancing and stay-at-home orders were enforced because of Covid-19. I then received instructions I need to compile the children's outputs and grades (conveniently stored in Moodle) Two weeks ago I tried to access my website, it prompted that my site no longer exists! I immediately posted to support.moodle.com asking if it was possible to recover my website since I also had instructions to prepare to teach the children online, and until now, no reply from Moodle Support. Yes, I acknowledge that Moodle does send emails reminding me that I should frequently log in to my website, and I did receive those emails it didn't prompt since I sort them using the tabs in Gmail (crazy and lazy, I know). Any help from anyone is appreciated. Thanks! Alfonso",

As you have found - if your \"free\" site isn't used it will be deleted - and unfortunately there isn't a process that allows you to recover this. The cost of maintaining backups for all the free sites and a process to restore them is just too high considering the massive number of free sites the moodlecloud system hosts. The best way to prevent this from happening in future would be for you to upgrade to one of the paid plans - the other thing that would be good for you to do is to use the Moodle course backup process and store a copy of your course backups locally. all the best!",

          "Text": "Hello MoodleCloud Community, We’re reaching out to update you about the recent performance issues that have affected some MoodleCloud sites. We understand how frustrating this has been for you and your learners, and we want to assure you that resolving these issues is our highest priority. After a thorough investigation, we can confirm that these problems are not related to any security breach or external attack; your MoodleCloud site remains secure and protected. Our technical team has identified several underlying causes that have contributed to slower performance in specific situations. In simple terms, we’ve found that some parts of the system have been handling background tasks and caching less efficiently than intended. These inefficiencies have, at times, increased load on our servers and caused slower page response times. We’re actively working on a set of fixes that will: Reduce unnecessary background activity, helping pages load faster. Optimise how data is stored and retrieved , especially in courses with more complex structures. Improve memory management for users who access sites without logging in. Ensure commonly used information loads more quickly and consistently. These improvements are currently being finalised and tested. They will be included in the upcoming Moodle 5.1.1 release, scheduled for 8 December 2025 . We’ll send a follow-up update on that date to confirm the release and share any further details. Thank you for your patience and continued trust as we make these improvements. We’re committed to ensuring MoodleCloud remains a reliable, high-performing platform for you and your learners.

          "Text": "All, I've been receiving really useful help here - maybe this will help others in the same situation as me: Ona typical course, I have 40 students, each has between 8 and 24 assignments to submit. Going through Moodle, opening each assignment one by one and checking for unmarked assignments is a real nuisance. I have made a spreadsheet with a bit of VBA. It cycles through all assignment windows in a course and opens each one in a separate tab. I then run through the tabs, and any where \"Needs grading\" is not zero, I know I have assignments to mark there. Where I see a zero, I just close that tab. In seconds, I'm left with only the tabs where I have marking to do. To make this: Create a spreadsheet, save it as an .xlsm (macro-enabled spreadsheet) Select a range of cells - single column. Into the cells, copy & paste the url's of each grading summary page (the one that shows Participants, Submitted, Needs grading), one under the next. Name this range - I called mine \" Assignment_URLs\" Copy & paste the following code in as a VBA module: Sub Open_Assignment_URLs_In_New_Tabs() Dim rng As Range Dim cell As Range Dim URL As String Sheets(\"Sheet 1\").Select ‘Change this to the sheetname where the links are [Assignment_URLs].Select ‘Named range where the links are ' Check if a single column is selected If TypeName(Selection) = \"Range\" Then If Selection.Columns.Count = 1 Then Set rng = Selection ' Loop through each cell in the selected column For Each cell In rng ' Get the URL from the cell URL = Trim(cell.Value) ' Open the URL in a new tab If URL <> \"\" Then CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run URL End If Next cell Else MsgBox \"Please select a single column containing URLs.\", vbExclamation End If Else MsgBox \"Please select a single column containing URLs.\", vbExclamation End If End Sub If you aren't sure how to insert VBA, ask ChatGPT - it gives a good explanation and examples. To use the spreadsheet: Log in to Moodle as teacher. Run the code; it should open as many new tabs in your browser as you have url's in the named range. Hope this is of use, Ian",

My site is using the School Theme available in MoodleCloud. I have not set any custom CSS . My course content is all built into Label Fields. Problem: The content is overflowing the screen on the right hand side.  Do I need to use some custom CSS code to fix this?  Is it possible to restrict the width in pixels for the Label Frame and if so what is the code to do this. Any suggestions on how I fix this? I also note the Moodle App for Android mobiles does not allow the content to fit within the screen on phone or Tablet.

I changed setting back to Show for HTML Blocks and it now appears and the Display on the Desk Top computer is fine now in reltion to screen overflow. The reason I hid this HTML Block previously is that the content of the Block needed changing for Public view and I have not been able to find how to edit this HTML Block which I created some time ago.  Can you suggest how I can find this Block where I can edit it?  When I turn editing on in either Manager/Course Creator/Tecaher roles, this custom HTML Block appears but there are no control icons around it to edit it.  I know this is very embarrassing that for a Block I created I cant remember how to edit it.  I have all the Manuals printed out for 2.7 version so if you can direct me to the best section that may help. It is possible that I accidentallyturned off some control in Site Admin which effected this. Regards Bruce",

There are a couple of ways to fix this, the first is the obvious and edit each page.  This is probably the simplest and long term probably the best option as it will work for the life of Bootstrap 5 (V4 was released in 2018).  The second option would be to add the required classes to the SCSS setting in the Custom theme settings options in the site administration.  This requires some HTML/ CSS knowledge to do correctly but it will potentially fix the issue site wide.",
