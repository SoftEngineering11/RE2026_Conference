This could be asking them something factual from the video (with an identified correct answer), or this could be a question along the lines of - 'having watched the video, are you ready to move onto the quiz' (where yes = correct, no = incorrect) You then have the necessary information to check 'completion' - which is then used to make the quiz activity available. An alternative (and less good) way of doing this, is to make the quiz available but not shown on the course page, you then (again using h5p interactive video) add a summary screen which includes the link to the quiz. I have done this with a client who specifically wanted this, but this isn't great for the person to revisit the quiz in the future, and if you create a new course based on this one, you would have to remember to go into the H5p to update the link to the quiz.",

If there are a large number of users in a course, and a small number of attempts, there seems no way to easily navigate to those attempts. I have courses where there are hundreds of pages of users listed. The quiz attempts page shows only the attempts, rather than all users whether or not they have attempted it. This would be much more useful. We use groups, and for teachers within groups they only see their own groups, so at least for those teachers it is easy to find the attempts. However, the page only tells a teacher how many attempts there are across all users, which is of no interest to them - they want to know how many attempts there are for their own groups. Again, the quiz attempts report does this very well as it states the total number of attempts and also the numbers from the teacher's own groups. It would be great if these features could be added in the future.",

It's a moodle case because of the proxy is not used when trying to download contetent types. I already tried to import manually the content type but it is not a suitable solution (upgrading content types is complicated). And some content types needs specific versions of libs. The easiest way is to use the proxy. The line ++ Blocked https://api.h5p.org/v1/content-types/: The URL is blocked. [user 2] ++ says that the url is not reachable. But a manually curl using the proxy is working: `* using HTTP/1.x` `> GET /v1/sites HTTP/1.1` `> Host: api.h5p.org` `> User-Agent: curl/8.14.1` `> Accept: */*` `>` `* Request completely sent off` `< HTTP/1.1 200 OK` And a manual test using the cURL lib in php works too. How could I force the use of the proxy in moodle. Set the proxy adresse/port not work. Alternatively, could you tel me which file is used for the job ? Maybe I can try to set directly in it the proxy ? Thanks.",

Some money is available. Background : H5P Interactive video can prevent a person from advancing the video to the end. Similarly, the engagement activities can be set to require the learner complete and pass the activity before proceeding. Requested features I can add audio and video to Course Presentation. I want to prevent a learner from advancing the audio or video , like in Interactive Video. I want Course Presentation to stop on every engagement activity , and not advance to the next slide until the activity is completed and passed. I want Course Presentation to support transparent video. AVI and WebM allow an alpha channel. I want to create an avatar speaker to mimic an instructor, and have that avatar overlay the slide. This lesson is H5P Interactive video , and demonstrates what I want to accomplish in H5P Course Presentation. Why? Because it will be easier to revise individual slides and avatar videos. Because the avatar video is lower bandwidth. Thx",

The downside of this approach would be that you'd get multiple attempts registered inside the gradebook, one for each transmission. The other downsides would be those implied by patching and forking. Note that all involved H5P contents (the main content and its subcontents) send out xAPI statements (\"results\") individually. The respective H5P integration (e. g. the plugin for Moodle or Moodle's own integration) could pick those up and store them as they see fit, but commonly do not. They only keep track of the main content, which in this case is Interactive Video. In other words: This could also be done by changing the code of the H5P integration (Moodle) without the need to change content types (and would help for some other content types, too). You'd probably have to introduce the concept of preliminary scores though, if Moodle's gradebook (or other host platforms' grade books) don't have that in order to make clear that the user has not completed the exercise. And, of course, there would be some variations, but long story short: You won't make that happen without changing code. Alternative: Use a Learning Record Store instead of Moodle's Gradebook, but that's likely not want you want.",

If my memory is correct it only did it on certain browsers (sorry I forget which) and it only did when the screen width was within a certain range (e.g. it didn't happen on narrow screens or very wide screens). The solution was to add some CSS to change the way the container behaved - but as this was a few versions back, I no longer have that code, but if you use the inspect tools to inspect the page as it is doing it, you may be able to work out the culprit, and make the necessary tweak to stop it from happening. Apologies for being slightly vague here, but it was 4 or 5 years ago that this happened - I thought it had gone away for ever so didn't keep the code that fixed it.",

I think the most important difference in the options is how the package files are stored and managed. The content bank provides a convenient place to store a content package so that it may be used in more that one place with out duplicating the file. A package in the content bank can be included with the filter in multiple locations or the file can be linked into activity using the Moodle file system using the content bank repository which is searchable. If you edit the package, changes will appear every the package is linked. These features are unique to the content bank implementation. If you do not need these file management features, it does not matter as much which implementation you use (the other implementations may be more straight forward because that lack these features).",

          "Text": "Hi Danny from Catalyst, Short answer is : it can't be done with H5P alone. But... if you combine an H5P activity with the power of Moodle, you can get a workable result. Here’s a detailed approach to achieve this goal: First, create the quiz using H5P and integrate it into Moodle as an H5P activity. Make sure that the H5P content is set to record attempts (using xAPI if necessary) to accurately track scores. Then, use Moodle’s grading feature to record the results of the H5P quiz. This will enable you to use the grade as a condition for accessing feedback. Next, create an additional activity or resource (such as a page or file) that contains the correct answers or feedback on the students' mistakes. Use Moodle’s \"Restrict Access\" feature to ensure that this resource is only available to students who have achieved a grade of 80% or higher. To configure this, go to the resource settings, then to \"Restrict Access,\" and add a condition based on the H5P quiz grade (e.g., Grade >= 80). By default, students with a score below 80% will not be able to see the resource containing the feedback, as the access restriction will automatically exclude them. Finally, make sure to test this setup with a student account to verify that the access conditions work as intended. This method leverages Moodle's conditional access features alongside the flexibility of H5P activities to meet the specific feedback requirements. By ensuring that grade tracking is enabled for the H5P activity, you can precisely control who has access to the feedback. HTH --C",

The version of Column that moodle is trying to install today is 1.17, no longer 1.16.7, which was the one that included the patchVersion reference. The download task works fine and downloads this content types on moodle 4.3 and 4.4, but not on 4.1. I'd say there is something else. I hope someone can check it. Regards",

          "Text": "Good morning everyone, I work on a 4.1.4 (production) and 4.3.3+ (testing) platform. The theme in use is Boost. The course formats I use are the standard one ( sections ) or Tiles format. The text editor in use is Tiny MCE. I use the H5P plugin ( black icon activity ) The problem I describe below occurs in both versions and with the different course formats and even if I change the type of text editor. On the previous version of the platform (3.7+), on the other hand, everything worked fine. I would like to understand how to solve it and if there are alternatives. Details In my courses, for ease of navigation, instead of putting H5P activities directly into sections, I decided embed those presentations into labels (or text or media areas) . This way the user can do the activities and then simply scroll down without having to first exit the activity and return to the course. The problem is that the embedded H5P activity is displayed cut off and thus missing the movement panes or the media progress bar, etc.. I have tried 3 types of embedding code. The first one: <p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;\">short description or subitle.</span> </p> <div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\" align=\"center\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/embed.php?id=2683\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> I've already tried changing the dimensions defined within the code , but nothing changes. However, if I put scrolling =\"yes\" the user can at least scroll down and see the rest of the activity...but it's annoying. The second: As the first one, but adding: <script\nsrc=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/library/js/h5p-resizer.js\"\ntype=\"text/ javascript \"></script> In this case the activity appears cropped, but with a click on the activity it is resized. The third: (which worked on the 3.7+ platform) <div\nalign=\"center\" class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe\nclass=\"embed-responsive-item\"\nsrc=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/embed.php?id=2683\"\nwidth=\"900\" height=\"506\" frameborder=\"0\"\nscrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> This format, which should facilitate viewing with mobile devices, remains \"cropped\" and does not resize or I have to set scrolling to yes (as the first). The goal is to have the H5P window fully displayed. Can anyone help me or provide a better code, please? THANK YOU. 😀 David.",

The error message \"Unable to load libraries\" in H5P can occur for several reasons. Here are the most common ones: Missing or Incompatible Libraries: If the required H5P libraries are missing or incompatible with the current version of H5P, you might get this error. Incorrect File Permissions: If the file or directory permissions are incorrect, H5P might not be able to access the required libraries. Improper Installation or Update: If the H5P plugin was not installed correctly or an update was interrupted, some libraries might not load properly. Database Issues:",

This plugin integrates seamlessly and provides a user-friendly interface to work with H5P content without leaving your course environment. Additionally, as of Moodle 3.8 and later, H5P support is included as part of core Moodle. This means you have the capability to create and interact with H5P content directly within Moodle without the need for any additional plugins. This core integration also supports the tracking of student interactions with the content, which can be incredibly beneficial for educational purposes. HTH C.",

Basically, until a couple of days ago, H5P activities were displayed correctly whether they were embedded in a label or displayed directly by clicking the activity. Now I see them all very small, positioned in the upper right corner compared to the original space they should occupy. I did not make any updates before the problem and even updating the plugin does not change anything. In fact, now it has asked me to activate the OER hub and I am getting an SSL problem... Have any of you experienced this problem before and were able to solve it? Thanks for any help. Merry Christmas. David 😊",

I am moodle admin for our school and a teacher let me know one of her youtube videos got taken down that she uses. She had interactive content in the \"summary task\" section. I think I know the answer to my question, but am just checking with others. So since the questions were timestamped in h5p to an existing video and now the video has since been taken down, it seems h5p had deleted the content/questions from the summary task section. Is there a way to find the old questions now or are they just gone forever since they were linked to the video that no longer exists? Thanks!",

I noticed this with new installations, since the task frequents is like 1 a month, when you have a new install it does not straight away 'downloads'/ 'make the contenttypes' avaiable. If you are a site admin (or when not give them these instructions): Login to site Go to Server > scheduled task search for the task \" Download available H5P content types from H5P.org (\\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task) if the column last run says \"never' then click on the radar fill in at minute */1, the rest is * Save the changes Wait 1 to 5 minutes (it kind of depends on how frequently your cron is running) Refresh the page, check if column last run now has a data and time Click on the 'radar' again check thebox \"Reset task schedule to default\" Save changes Go to the COntent bank and check if you now see Contentypes. If this did not work, check with your technical team/server contantperson if the Cron is correctly configured. Redo the steps. I hope this fixed your issue. Gemma",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I am have been given a large number of H5P files, some containing Presentations that are up to 20 slides and others that may be just a single activity. Many of the chapters in the course are made up of 3 - 10 H5P files. I would like the experience for students to be as seamless as possible, and not have to go back out to the course menu between H5Ps. I am looking for some best practices here. I will also need to be able to Restrict Access to future chapters until earlier chapters are completed. So, I need to preserve completion data - not for individual H5Ps, but for the collection that make up a chapter. I have some H5Ps that are quizzes. I'm fine with the quiz being a separate experience so that it can be graded on its own with no complications. I have seen some discussion about putting these all on a page, book, or lesson activity. Does someone have a resource for which method to use and why, or a pros / cons list for each, or something helpful in the way of best practices here? Thank you!",

It should be (and is) usable for all kinds of contents and content for teaching and learning also goes way beyond the notion of assessments. B ut if high-stakes assessments are that crucial (I am not a teacher, I cannot judge) , then choosing client-side evaluation was clearly a design flaw. I don't know the background however, so I can't tell what the prerequisites were. Server-side evaluation is on the roadmap of H5P Group, but I don't thing this is going to hit the shelves soon, because it would mean quite some work to redesign the core of H5P and also existing content types. So, the answer to \"Where are the other knowledgeable programmers?\" most likely is at \"H5P Group\". There are not too many H5P developers outside of the H5P core team, at least as far as I now of. I also don't believe that the moodle team is going to invest resources. And my answer to \"why aren't they helping to set the record straight\" would be manifold: lack of documentation (for external contributors), lack of interest (the moodle team included H5P in core even though they knew it's using client-evaluation when they started, and they probably don't want to invest resources in \"competition\" that would make it easier to get server-side evaluation into other platforms, too), lack of funding (the number of developers who would work on this in their free is tiny), complexity of the project (many technical aspects, possibly even coordinate developers inside and outside of the H5P core team), ...",

It seems that with some H5P types picking the answers is not possible or very difficult? For the fill in the gap question type demonstrated in the video, I was also able to recreate/search it out in Moodle (\"h5player (embed.php) -> h5p-iframe-[idnr]\"), only in a different place than in the Drupal example ( https://apps.zum.de/apps/15985 ). But I did not find it for multiple choice in Moodle (using Moodle 3.11.15). Is it possible to say that the correct answers are findable for each H5P type, but it's just a matter of effort and knowing the right place? Thank you very much for a classification! kind regards Klaus",

That semantics.json file can easily be understood, in particular if you look at the rendered editor next to it. It's quite obvious that for \"Multiple Choice\" the answers field holds the answer options including the text and the correct state. The structure will vary from content type to content type, but the principle is the same for all of them. The H5P Core transfers all the parameters that were entered by the editor from the server side to the iframe on the client side by passing a JSON object that follows the same structure as semantics.json. You could retrieve that information as part of the `window.H5PIntegration` object as `window.H5PIntegration.contents[cid-<contentId>].jsonContent` directly from memory. Just try running `for (id in window.H5PIntegration.contents) { console.log(JSON.parse(window.H5PIntegration.contents[id].jsonContent)); } // no error handling` in the development console inside either the H5P iframe's context or its parent's context and explore the output. You could even find the answers without knowing about the semantics.json file ... You could do the same programmatically as well, of course. Best, Oliver",

It is also possible to upload multiple H5P in a course backup and merge them into the course content bank.

          "Text": "@Christophe, 1.- I agree that this is confusing. The sentence \"Use the content bank (opens in new window) to manage your H5P files\" should be removed from that screen, it's useless and confusing. 2.- There are 2 ways to add an H5P content when using the blue icon: a) directly dropping an H5P content created elsewhere (e.g. with Lumi) into the Files box; b) clicking on the Add icon, which takes you to the Content bank where, hopefully, you have previously created the H5P you need. \"You can drag and drop file s here to add them \" is wrongly formulated, since you are only allowed (of course) to drop one H5P file in that box. This should be re-formulated. 3.- I expect the Moodle programmers who integrated H5P into core could not make up their mind whether to only accept creating H5P course activities by using H5P contents previously created in the Content Bank or to provide an easy \"shortcut\" for using H5P contents created outside the Content Bank. Hence the regrettably confusing interface. 4.- Anyway, I agree with your original post question \"where does it go?\". If an H5P content (created elsewhere)  is inserted directly into a course activity it should automatically be made available in the Content bank. This would be coherent with the way questions are created and inserted into a quiz activity. Questions for a quiz are either created beforehand in the Questions bank where they become available to a new quiz, or created when a new quiz is created, and subsequently become part of the question bank and available to any new quiz.😃",

I will probably move to the core plugin when I upgrade our Moodle version. My problem is that while the H5P plugin is working on the live site, whatever I do, I don't seem to be able to get h5p content working on our development sites (whether the Moodle version is 3.8 or 4.1). It fails gracefully I guess but simply doesn't load the interactive content. My dev environment is using a dump of live, but I have also tried backups and restores and they don't work either in these environments. I have tried using \"update content type cache\" h5p libraries admin and that makes no difference. I can't see the h5p code unless I turned off \"use saved content\" in the h5p admin. If turn that off, I can see the h5p code in the module instance settings, but when I press save it says, \"Something unexpected happened. We were unable to save this content\". The console shows a list of errors such as \"Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<' (at drag-n-drop.js?ver=1.1.5:1:1)\". In the console the most common error is \"h5p.js?ver=2020080400:976 Unable to find constructor for: H5P.InteractiveVideo 1.22\". I haven't upgraded the Interactive Video library, but I that is the same version running on my live site where the h5p works. Any help gratefully received.",

Even with a clean install of the plug-in in a new test environment, we're still seeing times of > 1 minute to open the sample Interactive Book from h5p.org (for example) For comparison, the same activity takes on average 3s to open after editing when using a local vagrant box running 3.9.11. From the console, it looks like view.php is the culprit, but I don't have the expertise to dig into this further on my own.

          "Text": "Hello, I what to talk about 2 questions. First problem: I have a problem with latex expression in h5p tasks. I have checked if  I create a task in content bank and use latex code, I can see the math expression correctly. However, if I create an interactive task, H5P green icon, and I choose the same task, the math expression is not displayed correctly, I see the latex code formula. Why does it occur? If I create a black icon H5P task and I use the task from content bank, latex is displayed correctly too. I installed the math displayed library and  mathjax in my server , modifing config.php file. I am making an interactive book from green icon H5P and I add different tasks, and in a dialog card I have written math expressions and they are not displayed and I can't create it in the content bank because the interactive books are differents. From content bank has less options than green icon type ( I don't know why). Then, How do I fix this problem? Second problem : I want to use Cornell notes h5p activity. I create the interactive activity (green icon), I select Cornell notes, I design the task and I publish it. When I try it as student role, I can write notes, but I can't save them. If I reload the task, I lose all notes and as teacher, I can't see the student's homework of this task. Can't I track or grade Cornell notes from my students?  Is it a bug? I hope to find solutions to my problems. Thanks.",

This is not only a problem when trying to open the content bank itself, but also when using the file picker to get to the content bank. Content banks with only a few exercises run smoothly. As soon as I get to about 10 H5P-exercises I start to notice the difference in speed. When I have over 30 it becomes very slow. But I have content banks with more than 100 exercises! These become almost inaccesible. Waiting times can be between 5 and 10 minutes. Often I just get a time-out. I read nothing about this on the forum. We can't be the only school with this problem, right?",

I downloaded a content type from H5P and added it manually and that is working fine, but obviously a long-term solution for updates would be most welcome. On: https://XXXXXXXX/mod/hvp/library_list.php When I try to do a cache refresh I get the following two error messages: Received HTTP code 403 from proxy after CONNECT Unable to connect to the H5P Hub. Please try again later Can anyone give me some guidance as to what to do next, please? I don't have backend access to the server here (and not sure I can get it), so if config behind the scenes is needed, I will have to send clear instructions to the server manager to get them carried out.

Then - after restore - you should be able to mend the broken links. Maybe even now, in the courses you moved, there will be some hints in the embedded links that will tell you out the H5P file's name you can try to re-link . It's unfortunately much worse in the case of activities - here the aliased file disappears completely, and so there's no hint - unless you remember which activity it was, or can check back at the original course location.",

          "Text": "Hello, I have a problem with an H5P activity in Moodle: Course presentation with Drag-and-Drop exercise. A drag item (a small image) is to be dragged onto a spot in the background image. When I open the task in the browser on an iOS device (iOS 15.5; ipad or iphone; Browser Safari or Firefox latest versions), I can edit the task as expected. (The drag item can be dragged onto one of the drop zones. The task will be evaluated correctly.) However, if I choose an incorrect answer on the first try and then want to repeat the task, not only is the drag item moved, but also the content of the screen in the background . As a result, drop zones \"disappear\" to the left and are no longer visible or selectable. The drag item can no longer be placed correctly. The task can therefore no longer be processed. I've tried whether you can get to the destination by holding and dragging the drag item, for example, or by tapping the drag item and drop zone. But that was not successful. The problem does NOT occur with MacOS, for example on a Macbook. The problem under iOS is documented in a small video, which is attachted here. (Background: Users expect us to solve the problem. Switching to the Moodle app is not a solution the user wants. They also don't want to work without drag-and-drop exercises. The user is faced with so many iOS -devices used that a change to other devices is not possible.) I would be very grateful for hints on possible causes of error or possible solutions. Thank you very much in advance … Matthias Addendum: The error described does not occur in the same exercise under Wordpress/H5P.",

While there are plugins which allow the conversion from the original H5P plugin to the Moodle version, it is probably a good idea to continue using the original version for the meantime. Once you are familiar with both version, you can make an informed decision whether to use only one version or keep both versions around.",

We have a large number of users from different institutions, so consequently we use groups to ensure that teachers cannot see details of students in other institutions. The H5P attempts list does not respect groups, so teachers can see attempts from students in other institutions, which is clearly unacceptable. We've had to remove the permission for teachers to be allowed to see any H5P attempts for this reason, which is a pity. There is a tracker item here https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-71662 which was created last year but it doesn't look like anyone is working on it.

If the next activity is restricted conditionally based on the score (or pass/fail) of the H5P, the link to the next activity can vary and is not immediately refreshed once the H5P is finished. The only solution is to have the student go back to the course overview page or have them refresh their browser so that Moodle unlocks the correct restricted activity. Has anyone else ran into this issue or know of any way to solve it? It was confirmed by the development team that this is a bug, but I would like to see if anyone has any workarounds! This is for a self-guided learning course and I would like to move the student in the correct direction after finishing a quiz in H5P. If the student performed well (let's say over 75%), then I want them to move on to the next topic. Otherwise, another practice activity in the same topic should be shown. I am hoping to achieve this without having the student go back out to the course overview page.",

Step 1: Uploaded an mp4 video, then went to step 2 Add Interactions. When trying to add the interactive content, we get an error message saying  \"Network Failure\". If we close this off and save this video - (without interactives), and play the video as if it were a student - it plays fine. Its adding the interactive content that does not work. In my initial search I saw something in regards to imbeded H5P vs H5P hub etc. Could this  be part of the issue? Could seeing 2 versions of H5P be a cause? I am having issues narrowing this down.

If you are providing a source for H5P materials, this may the right place. Developers that work on those implementations often respond in this forum to problems, but if you with details of setting up a new integration, there may be more developers interested in the General development forum or in LTI forum. It might also help to create a tracker issue if you want attention from the core development team.

We just upgraded to 3.9 and now whenever we're trying to create a h5p activity, chose the h5p activity content type, fill the forms, press save, the page just refreshes like I am creating a new h5p activity again. Only after these I started reading about it and realised that Moodle is developing their own h5p which is great btw . I am wondering how do we fix this? what are our steps? thanks",

The non-editing teacher access the Grades by the navigation meny in the course  to see the students results. By clicking the grade analysis button at a h5p activity, the score is shown, so is the students e-mail-adress. If the non-editing-teacher changes the user-id in the URL , the teacher will se the results, name and e-mailadress to an other user, that is not connected to this non-editing teacher, and is in an other group, This is not wanted considering privacy. When I try the same in a Moodle quiz, the non-editing teacher get the message: «You are not allowed to review this attempt.» Is this a known issue? Kind regards, Bjørn",

From experimenting with different H5P activities , using the same original image in different activities, (no changes made to the image size for example), the image used in the different activities appears differently; for example, using dialog cards, the image appears fine; however, when using image slider, the same image appears large and distorted. Not sure there's an answer to this observation, but if the same image used in any h5P activity could adjust automatically in the activity for viewing, that would be great--you don't know how the image will appear until previewing the activity in the course site.

I am building a languaje course which needs many different excercises, but especially \"fill in the blank\" activities . I decided the best way to present all the information and activities was to do it in an interactive book. The problem is that if one single page includes one long \"fill in the blanks\" the whole thing starts to fail. If I dare to have two \"fill in the blanks\" then the book refuses to open altoghether and after I have edited and saved the book, the \"page\" doesn't stop blinking until I push the edit or close buttons. I have seen that if I eliminate alternative answers it does not fail so\nmuch, but then again, if there are two of these activities in one page,\nor just one not so short (more than 5 blanks) then it won't work. This is an example of the kind of questions: ﻿ 1. A partir de mañana, ella *conducirá* el programa. 2. No importa lo que digas, no me vas a poder *convencer* de comer gusanos de maguey. 3. El puesto es tuyo porque te lo *mereces*. 4. Debo estar a la cocina porque el pollo se está *cociendo*. 5. No tenía idea de que *luciera* tan joven. I hope this gives you a better idea of what's happening. Many many thanks for your attention!",

There's also a pull request for optionally adding that feature for users who are not logged in, but it will probably take some time until that one is added. This question becomes moodle related if you are not using the H5P plugin but the H5P integration into moodle core of moodle 3.8+. To the best of my knowledge, the moodle core version does not feature the \"save content state\" option. Best, Oliver",

Wow these copies are getting out of control. I'll just go organise them into folder with nice version names or something uh ... click on the folder icon? oh. oh I see. Well, big old list of Presentation Actviity (copy) (copy) version 2 final (copy) Final version it is then. I might as well just have the files in dropbox and set it up as repository. I like the idea of content bank, and the fact that there might one day be other types of content libraries that can be added not just h5p.",

          "Text": "Hello Moodlers, I am checking out a test site with 3.9 and H5P. I am wondering how to best control which content types are available on the site. Here are the options as I understand them: Enable the cron job to download all types from the h5p.org hub. Upload individual .h5p/.zip for each content type you want With option 1 you can download all of the available content types, then delete any that you don't want to support (maybe for accessibility , duplication of functionality of other tools you use, or media storage reasons). The problem with option 1, as I see it, is that any time the cron job runs to fetch updates it will also re-install those unwanted types). Option 2 is attractive, but I'm not clear on where to get the installer files for the content types I want to enable. According to the h5p site, the way to add content types is via the hub that is included in the WordPress/Drupal/ Moodle plugins . I feel like I'm missing a piece here?",

We are planning to integrate H5P as a plugin in our campus, but we would prefer to offer a selected set of content types to our users. We think that this would be less confusing for them. Is there any way to do such a thing, instead of giving to any user with teacher role in any course the ability to install new content types? We are not about not  giving permissions, just trying to set an intuitive environment. Many thanks in advance for any tip, link or experience on deploying H5P in a big Moodle installation. cheers,",

It is best if you limit who can add a content type in the first place because once they are added it is not straightforward to remove an unwanted one - here is some info from a Slack discussion I was having: \"Content types are activated and upgraded in the activity editor within a course. There is not an option to remove a content type once activated. With capabilities you can limit content type management and just have you admins do it. You can do some library management at the admin settings level, including \"restricting\" libraries. We have used this feature to take away a content type that was accidentally or dependency activated, e.g. appear.in for Chat and Talk.\"",

We invite you all to try the beta version of the complete Moodle H5P solution at our demo site: https://h5p.moodledemo.net/ We also would like to encourage you to collaborate with the Moodle QA testing and help us to make 3.9 the best Moodle version ever. The QA testing will start on monday but H5P tests will arrive a bit later when all pending issues are integrated. Hot Topics The following issues have been integrated this week: MDL-67713 : Include H5P Activity backup and restore options MDL-68379 : the core library supports xAPI result, attachments and context MDL-68381 : Add duration, completion and success to H5P activity attempts MDL-68502 : mod_h5pactivity produce an error on filepicker when the file is deleted MDL-67800 : Implement events for content bank MDL-67790 : Rename content in the content bank Warm thanks To all the integrators of the HQ House, Guardians of the Code, Bearers of the Tracker Status, Protectors of the Master Branch and, hopefully, not Breakers of the Code Freeze.

          "Text": "We've made a recent upgrade from Moodle 3.4 to Moodle 3.7 and found that all H5P content of type \"Interactive Video\" stopped working. When attempting to view or edit any H5P interactive video on our Moodle site, we simply get a timeout resulting in bad session locks. I'll list all the relevant specs and changes I can think of: New Moodle version: 3.7.4 Change of $CFG->cachedir and $CFG->localcachedir Content Type library updated from 1.21.2 to 1.21.8 Servers (both production and test) are running memcached for sessions H5P version is 1.20.2 on both servers Directory permissions are identical on both servers (777 for moodledata and separate cache dirs) I've tried to replicate the issue on our test system and was successfull in doing so by simply moving said cache directories to their default location (in moodledata) and back (to their custom directory). That was enough. Strangely enough, on our test system, I have been able to remedy the situation by simply deleting \"cache\", \"localcache\", \"sessions\", \"temp\" and \"trashdir\" (in both paths where applicable). On production, this doesn't seem enough. Only two differences between the systems: 1) Production has internet access and thus 2) Production has more current plugin and content type versions (see 1.21.2 vs. 1.21.8 above) I'm at an absolute loss. PHP Debugging on max level is not helpful: \"session_start(): Unable to clear session lock record\" I'm hesitant to start playing around with session handler, etc. My best guess is some interaction between H5P and the moodle cache. But not sure, how exactly... and even less what I could do about it.",

I needed to take some additional steps to reproduce the problem on the test system in the first place: Moving around the cache & localcache folders. It might be worth noting that these changes (moving cache & localcache to more performant storage) were the only changes not tested in detail on the test system. (i.e. we checked whether the whole system would work with these changes, but not every single activity) We can add new H5P content, including interactive videos. That seems to work. We also do have *some* existing interactive videos that work. There does not seem to be a predictable pattern which work and which don't, though the majority fails to load. Other H5P content seems to work just fine. I'm planning to stop the production server completely for a short period of time tomorrow morning, allowing me to clean all moodledata directories I think might be involved: cache, localcache, lock, temp, trashdir Might it be worth a shot to add the \"muc\"-folder to this list?",

          "Text": "Hi everybody, This week, we have continued the hard work on H5P integration by advancing a more robust architecture at Content Bank and xAPI.  We are expanding the use of the Content Bank beyond the system level. Now, it can be used at the Course Category and Course level ( MDL-67786 ). On the other hand, substantial improvements have been applied to xAPI and we already have two of the key xAPI issues in integration, MDL-67734 and MDL-67788 within we can already\nhave tracking in the new H5P activity. Regarding the H5P Editor ( MDL-67814 ), we already have the issue in Peer review and we hope to have it in Integration soon. Furthermore, we are working on integrating the Moodle translation system in the H5P Editor ( MDL-68227 ) and adding a post in the translation forum where we explain our approach with the H5P editor localization.\nAlso, we would like to remove the ckeditor from the H5P Editor ( MDL-68240 ) in order to use the current editors in Moodle. Finally, the work in the Repository issue ( MDL-67812 ) has begun and it will allow to easily reuse the contents of the content bank. Hot topics The following issue has been integrated this week: MDL-68116 : Prepare Moodle to be ready when h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content. We already prepared Moodle to be ready when this year H5P closes h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content. We have removed https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/ [id] as default value in Display H5P filter and the embed field int the Atto button. It's important to notice that the api.h5p.org will continue to work and the only thing that H5P is going to change is the visibility of the test content on h5p.org, so that only the author can see it. Apart from that, there are several interesting issues waiting for integration review that hopefully will also land soon: MDL-67734 : Create basic skeleton for a global xAPI library needed for H5P content. MDL-67788 : Add xAPI statement support to mod_h5p. Tracking the students's attempts using xAPI in the H5P activity. Warm thanks We want to thank Eloy for taking such good care of us, for his enormous patience and great ideas. For always being available to all of us and accompanying us with his great experience and knowledge.",

This week we have been focusing on the basic structure and design of all different fronts we are working on: The first version of xAPI statement handler is already implemented, documented and waiting for peer review. You can find some more detailed information in xAPI MDL-67734 . The content bank is on its way. For now, the only module in core that uses content bank will be the H5P content manager, but we are sure more will come for future releases. And, as always in Moodle, everybody will be able to create their own content bank plugin as any other plugin type. We hope to get everything ready for Moodle 3.9 and encourage developers to create new plugins that suits their needs. We started working on the H5P core activity ( MDL-67707 ). This will enable users to create new core activities using existing H5P contents in the content bank. We will try to make it as compatible as possible with the current mod_hvp some of you are already using, to be sure you can continue using the content created in older Moodle versions. Hot topics: MDL-67060 : Improve admin UI to make H5P content types management easier for admins showing them all information together in the same page. MDL-67063 : Add a mechanism to support different H5P core_api versions in stable Moodle versions. Warm thanks: To Spanish healthcare system for taking care of some team members.

It would be fine for us to have a migration tool form ONE version of mod_hvp (perhaps the latest stable by April or so) to the initial version on mod_h5p in moodle 3.9. So we don't need this event been added and stored forever in the module db/upgrade.php For mod_h5p the history of upgrades would be clean, and always within mod_h5p. I', thinking something like the admin_tool tool_assignmentupgrade when mod_assignment was deprecated and mod_assign was born. The key point is that I think admins do not need a complete \"any previous version of mod_hvp is compatible with any future version of mod_h5p\". We need a path for upgrade, avoiding being trapped by scenarios where maximal upgradeable state in an install doesn't match with minimum upgradeable in the other branch. The current mod_hvp version 1.20.2 (2020020500) is compatible from moodle 2.7 up to 3.8. So, and admin migrating to 3.9 (or further) just will need to upgrade mod_hvp yo this 1.20.2 (2020020500) version (or other agreed with hvp people in these months before 3.9), then migrate to initial mod_h5p in a 3.9 installation, and then upgrade that to 4.0 or 4.3 in the future. I wholeheartly agree with Stuart that content migration is a must. Unthinkable otherways.  This must be part of the initial implementation plans for h5p integration in core.",

Although we still have many details to polish, and a handful of decisions to make, the core tasks of the project are on the verge of integration, closer than ever. We'll probably see any of them integrated next week: MDL-67063 - keeping updated H5P in your Moodle instance. MDL-67707 - H5P activties, a must. MDL-67734 - xAPI. Are you kidding me? MDL-67786 - Content Bank? H5P plugin? Can't wait. MDL-67795 - unfortunately, some times you'll have to delete stuff. MDL-67814 - the H5P editor is almost ready for your eyes; next week will be under peer review. Hot topic MDL-68116 - we need your feedback to improve the H5P Atto button screen. There is an \" URL or embed code\" field to make it easier for users to reuse content from other sites, specially h5p.org. Please vote for one of the options available or give us a\nnew one. Warm thanks International Women's Day is Sunday! The world certainly needs more women in tech, but we are fortunate to have a bunch of them making Moodle better every day, both in Moodle HQ and in the Moodle community. We want to give a big shout out to every one of them, for sharing their talent and energy, and for pushing forward our mission and goals.

          "Text": "Hi everyone, The Carnival has arrived at Moodle HQ and at the same time we have started our third sprint surrounded by the best possible environment. During this sprint, we will focus on finalizing the standalone version of the H5P Editor ( MDL-67814 ), we will provide the Content Bank with new features that will allow us to more easily manage the H5P content packages ( Epic 3.9 ) and integrate xAPI with the new H5P activity ( MDL-67788 ) allowing us to handle the tracking of the H5P contents. In addition, we are working on small issues that will turn the Moodle 3.9 H5P integration into a more robust solution ( MDL-67302 and MDL-67095 ). On the other hand, next week, the Moodle Moot Japan 2020 , from 26th to 28th, will be held in Kumamoto, Japan. There, our Moodle LMS Product Manager, Sander Bangma , will talk about H5P and the future of Moodle LMS. Another opportunity to hear directly from Moodle HQ. Hot topics: MDL-67337 Apply Display H5P filter inside <a> tags: From now on, when somebody copies an H5P content URL from a Chrome browser address bar and pastes it in Moodle's rich text editor, it is pasted as a link, inside <a> tags and the 'Display H5P' filter will be applied. MDL-67707 Create a new H5P activity: The first version of the new H5P activity is waiting for integration allowing progress in the integration with xAPI. MDL-67062 Add Admin UI to delete existing libraries: Allow Admins to be able to remove libraries from the Admin UI to Manage H5P content types. MDL-67786 Create a new 'contentbank' plugin type and a new H5P plugin in the content bank. MDL-67063 Add a mechanism to support multi H5P core_api versions. Warm thanks: We would like to thank our super developer, Amaia , an example of commitment, effort and knowledge at the service of the team. Tons of thanks for all the help you give us every day and your active participation in technical and functional decision making. It is blessed to have Amaia by our side.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, We're excited to announce the new features for the integration of H5P into Moodle 3.9 and the progress during these past weeks. Our main goal for Moodle 3.9 is: Integration of H5P content types with Moodle gradebook and activity completion. Improved integration of H5P content type selection in Moodle's activity chooser. To this end, we have worked hard to get a first functional prototype that covers most of the needs expressed in the studies and interviews conducted to the community throughout 2019. The result, is an approach that allows Moodle to be more versatile in content creation. To do this, we have created a prototype that separates the H5P activity module from content creation. Two clearly different mindsets. One for the activity and one for the content creation. In this way, a user can create or add new H5P content from Moodle without associating them with an activity. On the other hand, through the activity, you can access those contents in a simple way and use them through a new repository where you can\nchoose the H5P created in the Content Bank and take advantage of all the activity's functionalities as activity completion or grading. On the Content bank, you will be able to create, import and edit H5P files, among other functionalities.\nThrough this separation, we enhance the reuse of H5P contents that are created or imported into Moodle allowing them to be used in any activity or using the Atto editor or the filter anywhere in Moodle. It will help to provide Moodle with great\nflexibility looking forward to the future. We would like to add all the news and progress in the integration of H5P and Moodle every week. Hot topics: You can check the prototype of the activity here . We will add the link to the Content Bank prototype as soon as possible. We are still working on a full version. You can check the Epic for 3.9 here . We are still finishing the work of adding issues in the epic.

Finding out how to interact with the content bank. Content bank ( MDL-67786 ) - creating a new content bank type plugin (H5P will be the first one). Besides, we have been improving the initial integration of H5P available from Moodle 3.8, such as MDL-67063 (allowing several versions of the H5P core library to coexists) and MDL-67060 (enhanced libraries management).

          "Text": "I really love the idea of H5P (new hotness). It is pretty easy to use. It usually looks good (if you build it well). I keep hearing people say it is better than SCORM (old and broke) and these are people who know what they're talking about. But I keep finding little things that are deal breakers. I can caption video. That's great! But if I add audio, no captioning. I can use YouTube video, which already has captioning (possibly bad captioning, but captioning)...but if I use it in interactive video, where I add questions or interaction, the captioning is gone. There's no way to get captions on a YouTube video with interactive video that I can find. Interactive video is so cool. But if you use a large video (what video isn't?!?), your whole site might suddenly start crashing. Yes, I'm sure. And reporting. This is a big one. First. The reports are...not easy to find. Why would I go to the gradebook for activity reports? Well, if I'm using H5P, that's where I go. If I create an interactive video module, my users have to answer the questions and then manually submit them for it to report to me that they have done anything. If they don't do the submitting thing (and there is no way to know you need to do this), it might not remember they did it. Sometimes it starts where they left off...and sometimes it doesn't. And if the site crashes because the video is big...it always forgets. (to be fair, really large scorm modules can muck things up too, but they remember doing it). I'm not hung up on WHEN they started, just that they did. And that they finish. And that it knows they finish. If I want completion to be contingent on completing the whole thing...well, there is no tracking. I can just click next indefinitely and not do anything. If I set up branching, there is a button at the top that lets me skip entire sections . If I want completion to be contingent on a specific score...well,It doesn't do completion on a particular score--only if a score exists...I could fiddle with grade book settings for a grade to pass but I'm not confident it would actually work, because, well scoring is weird. Really weird. I can get grades (or complete/incomplete) from SCORM. If I find an error and need to change it while it is being used by students, when I make the change, it forces my users to start over. Updating SCORM is easy and doesn't mess up reporting. If I want to know how people answered questions. Well, I'd better use something else. That's not something H5P does. SCORM does it (badly--but I can get the data!). I really want to use H5P but I don't think I can. I need these features that SCORM has. Discuss?",

          "Text": "So, I've created SCORM content with Lectora, Camtasia and Captivate. I've seen/manipulated content developed with other products. I've heard some really good things about Articulate (so your complaints are surprising. Back when I first started working with Lectora, if I had seen Articulate first, I probably would have gone that direction instead. But I love Lectora.) I've also used eXe and iSpring. Honestly, I recommend Quiz for testing always. SCORM reports results but cannot give any kind of effective stats on overall participation. Quiz gives stats. LOVE that. I don't test is scorms ever if I can help it (knowledge checks for interactivity, applicability stuff but not actual testing) My experience with people who complain about authoring software is that they generally haven't learned how to set them up properly or they don't think outside the box or they want something that does the hard stuff for them. It really helps to know what you want before you start. I think building in H5P is generally easy. I want to like it. I want to use it. But it can't do what I need with reporting and some of the 'interactions' are a bit clunky. I tend to build branching type stuff...there are four things you have to do but you can do them in any order you want, and my materials tell you when you've completed one. H5P...not so much...you can branch but it is more story branching than what I do. That said...I LOVE story branching! I have used it in the past for human resources training and case management training... I wish I could use it for what I do but the thing I need it...well, it's IT training, which makes story telling more complicated and I'll only have a month of development time (plus my regular job duties for supporting tech for all our departments, answering help calls and managing our Moodle) which isn't a lot of time. Research says a 1 hour on-line module should take about 80 hours of development. I don't think I ever take that long...but you're better off with smaller bites of content--10 to 15 minutes apiece (so, as much as 20 hours of dev)--our attention spans aren't that long and with our tech dependence, they are getting shorter! Tom Kuhlman (Articulate) calls short courses coursels, which I love--he is my hero, so awesome! (Well, and Dan Marsden and Tim Hunt. And Helen and Mary...) Interactivity takes time. You have to know what you want and how it should look/behave. If the student does X, what happens? If they do Y, what happens? It can help if you can create a template and build from there. I once built a course where the student had three case files they had to complete. It was mostly story telling and choose-your-own adventure types stuff with good ending and supervisors telling you you did the wrong thing. It took a ridiculous amount of time to build and was incredibly complicated...but it worked...later I stripped all the actual content out and saved it as a template shared it with a work group I'm a part of...I don't know what happened with it after (but people still talk about it and that was 2 years ago). Lectora is expensive, but I think worth it. It also allows a lot of granular control--variables, action sequences. In fact, if you want any interactivity, you must use variables and action sequences, which requires some braining and working out what you want and when. Captivate is less expensive (but getting more expensive every year) but gives less control--I could set conditions in lectora where if X was true (like a specific quiz grade or range was acheived) then the course would be marked complete at the end but I can't do that in Captivate--completion reporting is hard coded--you give it a grade for passing an that is it--I sometimes don't want 80%, I want a range because it isn't a quiz, it is an assessment of something (like a personality quiz) and Captivate is balls at that. And branching is hard in Captivate (it's hard anyway, from the brain standpoint, but harder). So, that was kind of a dis to people who complain about the tech...to be fair, I complain a lot about Captivate--but that is because it takes about 3 times longer to build something in it than Lectora. Knowing how to do something only gets you so far...but creating interactive video is pretty easy with H5P, which is why it was so attractive. It's fairly easy with Camtasia, as well, but there are weird things about reporting there, too (but it reports and reports completion) and sometimes it crashes or does weird stuff. The short answer is both of SCORM and H5P require skills (with the tech, with design, with knowing what you want). If you just want to share some information and don't care about tracking (like a ppt), it might be easier to use H5P (or upload the ppt). If you want tracking, SCORM works better because, well, it tracks. If you want interactive video and don't care about tracking, H5P is probably nicer to use. If you need to know the person actually did the whole activity, SCORM is better, in spite of being an oldster. And branching, well, if you want tracking and don't care about looking spiff, Lesson is fantastic. If you want tracking and pretty, SCORM. If you just want pretty, well, H5P is okay. But this is a data driven world. We want tracking. If it is just practice, that's fine, go for H5P. But if it isn't practice, I have to still go with SCORM. And that makes me sad.",

          "Text": "So, I created an interactive video with H5P. It is, admittedly, a long video--90 minutes. Throughout, there are questions (hence, interactive).  It went live and within about 45 minutes my server started acting strange. Users across the site started experience Server 500 errors, intermittently. We looked into it.  Something has been opening database connections, leaving them open, sucking up resources and then spontaneously aborting them.  And then the server crashes. It comes back up and starts all over again. Only one thing has changed: the H5P module went live and started getting use. We had no problems when testing it before the go-live, but then it was just me messing with it. So, it seems pretty likely that the issue is related to the H5P. I switched to H5P from SCORM because I didn't like the way the scorm published video couldn't seem to remember where it left off if the user had to stop and come back (Camtasia published scorms just aren't that smart. The alternative is manually captioning 90 minutes of video in Captivate. No. Just...no. Of course, that would work. but I've already spent hideous amounts of time fidgeting my captions to deal with the fact that Safari and Chrome only allow one line of caption...). I'm running Moodle 3.6.2 (will probabaly upgrade to 3.7 in November or Dec).  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this or why it would cause this problem?",

The Install Now button will only show if you’re installing the version of the plugin that is compatible with your version of Moodle. So what version of Moodle are you on?

So they will just play the play button and rinse and repeat until the video ends. This makes h5p extremely frustrating to use as a video question platform. Is there any setting that needs to be changed to work around this? Thank you so much.",

Also, in the very near future, there will be h5p.com which offers features on top of just providing content types, e.g. data storage or analysis. Those will not be free. H5P is open source software, so even we went down or became dickheads, someone could take the mantle and establish something like a core team to continue development. If someone wants to, he or she could also do that right now and fork the whole project. Feel free to judge how open and dedicated we are by having a look at our source code , lively discussions on our forums or our ticket system where you can even track what we're working on. We may be a company, but H5P is a community project and should be to a larger degree even. Are you asking if we should be held accountable for copyright infringement by others? Best, Oliver",

We are the same way.  So much so that we use Moodle for that very reason, in that we are in control of our LMS.  We can say with certainty that until we turn off the servers we can provide teachers with this service. We quickly adopted the H5P plugin based on what we saw in their forums, the usefulness of the plugin to teachers, and just a general feeling that this is too good to not offer to our teachers - even if it went away.  Almost an \"enjoy it while you can\" assumption. As you can see from Oliver they are very much interested in keeping this open source.  I wouldn't delay trying it out.  It's very good.",
