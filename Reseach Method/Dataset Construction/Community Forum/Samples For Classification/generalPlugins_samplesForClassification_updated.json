          "Title": "Downloader - Would this be a resource?",
          "Text": "I am going to be developing a downloader for Moodle for a client. I am wondering what is the best way to develop it. I have made an Activity module before, the Map Module . I have looked here to figure out what would be the best way to develop the module. Basically the downloader would be available for teachers. It would download resources for a course and allow the teacher to choose which groups/students and/or which assignments they want to include. I want the downloader to available to all courses by default. I have looked at other downloader modules but the client has resources stored in non-standard methods on various servers. The easiest way I could think to make it would be a resource. But these are the reasons I think it wouldn't work. The resource would have to be manualy created for each course The link to the resource would show to students(unless it was manually hidden) The creator of the resource would have fill out the configuration form when there is really need to create a separate instance for each course. I thought about making it a block but I really need a form that would be in the main portion of the page so that the user could select the needed resources. I looks like I could make the main page file in the block folder but then it seems I would have to duplicate a lot of programming for creating the other parts of the page. Any ideas? Thanks",

They're getting 1 page of the certificate printed with borders and signature (the images), but blank spots where text should be and that error message above printed on a 2nd page. From what I gather, they can view it fine, though. Extra information: In both of these cases, neither the students' names nor the class names have an apostrophe in them. I don't know enough about how the PDF creation process executes, but is it possible the new code somehow breaks functions in the PDF creation (tcpdf?) when it's reading data back in now in a different format?",

          "Text": "Everything regarding the database seems fine, including all of the data. I can, however, confirm that there is definitely something wrong with the PDFs that are being generated. They somehow seem to be \"corrupt.\" The problem isn't that there are any empty fields in the PDF. If I open the PDF up on my computer and just view it on my monitor, everything is fine. All of the information (course name, instructor, hours, student name, etc.) is properly displayed. The problem comes when I try to print them and these PDFs are not printing out correctly. To test this again, since my work computer was not having any issues viewing or printing, I tried to open these same PDFs on my home computer. Sure enough, I could not print them. Using Adobe Acrobat 8.1, I get an error message that just says 'could not draw the object' and it completely refuses to print anything. When I use Foxit Reader 2, it prints the certificate, but without any of the text - only the images (border, signature, seal) print out. This is not too terribly surprising, given the error message listed above that one student sent me includes font names in the message. I can also confirm this is not limited to 4.2, as I went back and tried to view older certificates generated under 4.1 and had the same issues when attempting to print them on my home computer. There is definitely something wrong with the way the PDFs themselves are created. I can't figure out what that could be, though. Given that there is a font name in the error message, and text is not being printed out on the paper (but viewed fine) confuses me. I don't know a lot of technical details about PDFs, but the only thing that I can think of is perhaps when printing it's having issues with the fonts in the PDF. Perhaps it can compensate on my work computer as it has a lot of fonts installed on it. However, my home computer does not have any additional fonts installed and it can't print. This is a totally wild guess, though.",

There is a block called the sidebar block where html or other code can be put in it as far as I understand. I have a little flash application that calls streaming flash audio (three little squre buttons, you've probably see it on the internet). Could I use the sidebar block to house the flash application and have the audio that is called be specific to the module that the student is in. So three activities and three different sound clips only one showing at a time associated with the activities. On a higher level, could that little flash app be programmed into the specific activities or on the main interface outside of a block? Oh, has anybody used this block where I could see a sample of it as a guest? Thank you. Cordell Jones",

Trouble is that the server logs say that cron has been completed successfully, but it doesn't report if any of the individual tasks failed to run. When we looked at the cron task in moodle, the legacy cron task wasn't running, and this seems to have been the key issue. We also found that the table local_reminders, required by the 'Event_Reminders' plugin wasn't present. I'm not convinced that was the case though as I had checked the tables the day before. Anyhow, we got 'event reminders' running so I can confirm that it does in fact work in moodle version 2.8 Peter",

If you want a clean, easily inderstood, but usable module , I suggest looking at Eduardo Monteiro's Solution module It checks if a student is not a guest and then displays a resource (as such I really think it belongs inside the resource module ) But the code is very readable and uses a lot of Moodle's functions. It is a nice module to experiment with and it is working out-of-the-box. Best way to start, I think, would be to change the file view.php inside the module and make it display something, even if it is only \"Hello, world\". Then check if it is possible to add instances of your new module to a course. If you got this module running, experiment with some of the functions in moodle's library. Try reading something from a database table, using get_records() and displaying it. A quick way to browse all of moodle's code and see how variables / functions are connected is this crossreference . Hope you can get this 'modules for dummies' section started.",

Teachers on my site are not able to add new activities from our plugins (Checklist, BigBlueButton, Lightbox Gallery); nothing added to our site shows up in the activity chooser menu, nor in the dropdown menus. They show up for administrators (for some reason Lightbox Gallery shows up for Manager role). I checked the site permissions and teachers are set to Allow for create new instances. All of these plugins are enabled on the site, they are all the most recent versions and teachers have no other role than editing teacher. They worked fine in 2.2. When I made the update to 2.3 everything seemed to check out and all of them work when I try to add them as an Admin. I looked in each plugin to make certain they include the addinstance permission in the mod/db/access.php file. They do. Courses added/restored after the upgrade to 2.3 are working properly and teachers can view the plugin activity resources and activities. The downside is that it does not work if I backup/restore one of the courses in which it is not already working. When I create a blank course and restore a course backup (from one that was not working) Merging the contents into the existing course, then I'm back in business. As a last resort I'll do this if I have to for all of the courses but I really don't want to. I've tried deleting them from the installation and reinstalling, I've tried prohibiting the teacher permissions and then allowing to see if that would fix it. I'm not sure what else to try at this point. Are those courses just broken?",

Just to check the basics: i) installation is all complete. Visit: site administration -> notifications . An incomplete install will show an installation wizard screen here. ii) you have enabled it at : site administration -> plugins -> filters -> manage filters iii) you have added the string \"generico\" to the csv list of icons that should show at the bottom of the atto toolbar settings page at: site administration -> plugins -> text editors - atto-= >atto toolbar settings Once we're sure all that is ok, then type longhand (do not copy and paste): {GENERICO:type=welcomeuser} Copying and pasting is fine, but it can bring invisible html characters which mess up the parsing, so for now do it longhand.

          "Text": "The very first thing you should do is fix the SQL statement. Using \"mdl_\" in an SQL statement will completely break on any site that uses any other prefix (which includes and sites set up to run PHPUnit or Behat tests) - for Moodle SQL statements, always wrap the table name in { and } - e.g. \"SELECT * FROM {user}\" (NEVER write \"SELECT * FROM mdl_user\"). But, even better, in this case, just write $DB->get_records(\"tablename\", []) - where tablename is the name of the table without the 'mdl_' prefix. Have a good read through of the Moodle data manipulation API documentation. After you've got the DB query sorted out, the next step would be to move everything into a local plugin , turn your handler into a webservice then rewrite your javascript code to call this via the AJAX api . All of this is quite a bit of work (especially for someone new to Moodle development), but will, in the end, give a good solid base for further development.",

          "Text": "We would like to invite comments and feedback on a module we created that advises users on which (Moodle) course to take next. The Learning Technology Development Programme of the Educational Technology Expertise Centre (Open Universiteit Nederlands) is aimed at innovative learning technologies to create, promote and use learning networks. A major theme is 'navigation' through a learning network. The Road Mapping (ROMA) project focuses on exploiting collective learner progress as a feedback mechanism to aid successful learner navigation and improve educational yield. One of the ROMA projects determined whether feedback influences the track followed by the learner. An experiment was set up, where the activity nodes of the learning network were modelled as Moodle courses. A new module was developed to advise the learner which course to take next. The module relies on the completion of courses, which in our case was designed by using a quiz. The experiment also changed the standard Moodle navigational aids, such as the breadcrumbs, and therefore can not run with one of the standard themes. In addition to the new module, some of the existing Moodle code needed to be changed (detailed information is available in the attachment). The experiment is no longer available, but some further information can be found at our DSpace server , e.g. http://hdl.handle.net/1820/245 , http://hdl.handle.net/1820/353 , http://hdl.handle.net/1820/436 .

All the others will \"load\" the player, so I can see a empty video player plug in but with a blank screen (some like m4v files displayed a greyed out quick time icon) I have every single media player on this machine (due to this problem i went and got them all and tested online). The files are also linking correctly if i go direrctly to them they will load up propperly or let me download them depending on the type of file.

I wanted to install the Flashcard module, So I downloaded/uploaded it and unzipped it to the mod folder. A subfolder named flashcard was created. I then tried to go the Admin folder, and got a blank page. After a little hunting around, I ended up deleting the folder. Everything came back to normal. I then got a file for of the flashcard from the latest build. (I think its the latest). There was one on the web that had a different version (with bulk upload ), buth that sent me back to Moodle's latest build. I again uploaded the file, and expanded it this time directly to the mod folder. The mod folder has a \"flashcard\". Under the flashcard folder are a number of files, a dbfolder with a couple of files, a lang folder, and a pix folder. The admin page worked this time, but now the Notification page is blank when I try to access it. So I turned on debugging from the Site Administration> Server >Debugging menu and selected both \"Show all reasonable PHP debug messages\" and checked Display Debug messages. When I again clicked on the Notification link, the following message appeared: Fatal error: Call to a member function get_manager() on a non-object in /home8/letsrea1/public_html/moodle/mod/flashcard/lib.php on line 25 Looking at lib.php line 25 is $dbman = $DB->get_manager();",

The first and second install instances were new. All were version 1.9 something, not the developing 2.0 version. I then installed the module called flashcard_19_release2.zip. (Unzipped it and placed the folder it unzips into in the \"Mod\" folder. Logged in as administrator. I then went to the Site Administration area, selected Server >> Debugging and then under the drop-down box \"Debug Messages\" selected Developer: extra Moodle messages for developers. This is so you get rich error messages. You may want to turn this off after you solve the installation problems. I then selected Miscellaneous > XMLDbEditor. The main frame contains a list of all the database tables. I clicked on Test or one of the other queries. After I closed this, I went to the notification tab and found the message about the flashcard module. The module seems to work -- but I still am having problems having it show the pictures. I have not spent a lot of time on it this week, but will do so this next week. I'll let you know what I find. I don't know if the first two Flashcard installs were from the Flashcard.zip or flashcars1.9wBulk.zip file. I think the Flashcard.zip one from the latest build is a 2.0 based. So I'm not sure if the problem was a versioning issue or because clicking on Test and querying the database made a difference. Like I said, there are still a few problems with implementation on my site. Louis",

          "Text": "Hi guys, here come some news of the \"from now\" generation of flashcard. As for some projects that were highly demanding of flashcards, i started reviewing the upgraded version of Tomasz and redrew a more \"moodle way\" handling of the media files for cards. In addition was a review of the card deck customisation setup. At the same moment, i was reworking Magtest and Tracker for a more complete handling of new Moodle 2 APIs. Thus the flashcard was completed with course completion implementation and more consistant course overview reports, to get it raised at a \"state of the art\" level. We then worked with Tomasz to check how a merge was possible. We concluded in shifting back to my worktrack for the future, as Tomasz is not available for the moment on Moodle contribution work and has no projects demanding for flashcards. The recent version published is a intensively tested and used version installed on 55 secondary schools and 40 higher education schools with active users. So it will be frequently addressed for bugfixes and will consolidate. Yet is this version stable enough for daily production. It should not evolve any more for a while, unless if we can finish integration of a video player to provide video handling on cards. We abandonned idea of a conversion script. Tomasz opted for handling media as embeds in a text card. I kept my original idea to have mediatyped card side, and use an explicit filearea for those medias. Possible is it a bit less flexible to build cards in any way the teacher wants, but gets simpler to use for people having no time to format content. This version is being tested from 2.3 to 2.5. 2.6 adventurers might report us compatibility issues to schedule work on for the future. Cheers Valery.",

          "Text": "Hi I've been looking at the Etherpad-Lite addon and from a user perspective Etherpad-Lite much looks like what our teachers asked us for \"collaborative editing\". However I see the last version of the addon now dates back to mid 2012 - which doesn't seem very active although I can at least confirm it still runs on Moodle 2.5.x. In terms of security - I do know that Etherpad in its basic setup just cares about the pad ID - meaning that once you know the pad's ID you can edit it, simple as that. It isn't really intended to share documents online and keep them away from others inside the org (i.e. Teachers and Students) Now there seem to be LDAP user plugins (I haven't checked them out yet) for etherpad-lite but I'm a bit sceptic by the fact, that etherpad only uses the API key to authenticate Moodle (ahem: the user's browser as it seems, the user browser communicates with Etherpad, not the moodle server , right?) and the pad ID (which you can see in the page source code of an etherpad page inside Moodle. Maybe I'm looking at it from the wrong angle but even if it looks promising from a user's perspective, I'm not really at warm when looking a bit closer at the addon for Moodle - when you need at least some protection so classes can't overwrite pads they shouldn't get access to. What's your take - anyone using this addon in real-life? -- Mat",

It seemed to be an affordable choice to avoid the stress of installing, configuring and updating this service on our own server. Although they had a few minor problems the primaryPad team is very kind and they are reacting fast. After the integration into moodle with the available PlugIn we ran some tests where everything worked as we expected. Since a few days it is not working anymore. On our side there were no changes so this is still an unsolved problem. The Plugin seems to be a few years old and has only minimum options for configuring. Another thing that could become a problem for us is that the service can be used from everywhere and can not be restricted to a course level. A Pad created in a course can be published anywhere and can even be accessed by people outside the course with usernames of their own choice. I totally understand that the primaryPad team must be charged to avoid this issue, but a practical solution for this is not part of the package and might not be an easy task. Maybe someone knows a solution for this? We also miss an option to export the content so that it can be opened in a locally installed editor like OpenOffice or LibreOffice. The HTML-Export seems to be the only standard option available. Regards Peter",

I'm not sure what PHP development you want to do - installing a plugin shouldn't require any modification of the PHP code. To use the filter, you just need to enable it on your system: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Managing_filters Then, according to the plugin documentation, you just need to add some text onto your Moodle site (e.g. in a forum post, or in 'page' resource), that looks like the example in the plugin description, e.g. \n```text\n\\flowChart[inline, yes-text:yup, line-width: 2]{st=>start: start\nin=>inputoutput: x,y\nop=>operation: z=x+y\nou=>inputoutput: z\nen=>end: end\nst->in->op->ou->en}\n```\n If everything is working correctly, then the filter will spot that specific text in the what you have written and replace it with the flowchart described by that text.",

We do have this item on the feature requests which has the potential to add support for tracking time spent by users in a more accurate and potentially more granular level: https://github.com/catalyst/moodle-block_dedication/issues/70 but... no one has volunteered to fund the development required to implement this within the plugin at this stage.",

I am looking for a second opinion about it, user feedback about this activity and some help testing it. So if someone has some time to try this out and send me some feedback, that would be helpful. This activity is still in development, so i dont recommend using it on a production server . I have tested this only on Moodle 2.3 and Moodle 2.4... This player is based on Matt Bury's MediaPlayer(Thank you!), but this is a lightweight version of that. It does not have the snapshots, bitstreaming, metaviewer, skins, logo, etc.. functionality(mostly because the free version of JW Player 6 does not support those). Although it enables you to use start image, multiple captions, playlists(from youtube or upload multiple mp4 files - HD Switch is supported too) and a little bit more. Currently only mp4, flv, webm video formats are supported. Captions support is the same as goes for JW Player 6(vtt for example). I have'nt done much documentation about it, but it should be relatively easy to understand it. You can download and try this out - https://github.com/t6nis/moodle-mod_jplayer Or you can go and view some examples here(login as guest) - http://moodle.t6nis.com/course/view.php?id=3 I have'nt figured out a decent way for streaming support...

I have many small videos from over the years that I have been looking for an easy way to make them available for view by new students each year. This will let me display them very easily. I have been playing the last hour or two in my Moodle 2.3 dev site without any problems, mixing and matching various resolutions and types of videos. In fact, I have discovered that this module, along with the PoodLL online assignment, and the PoodLL repository go together and open the door for new possibilities. Thanks, AL",

I selected add new activity in edit mode, typed in the name for the button label. - \"Resume last studied lesson \" click update and I get this error: Not Found The requested URL /mod/user/view.php was not found on this server . When i cannot go any further i returned to the main course page and see that the button had actually been added, great. So i click on the button and I get the same error message. I have tried this with admin and student accounts, same result. Obviously there is no user directory in the mod folder, so i assume the PHP is calling on the incorrect directory location. This should probably be /user/view.php without the mod in front?? perhaps im wrong? ----------------------------------------- OK Scrap that, i figured it out. The students and admins i used for testing had no record of which last viewed resources. I went into a preview of a lesson and back out, clicked the resume button, it now works ok. same with student account.",

Note the use of the prefix _root to make the variables accessible from the onRelease function. Also, note that the event is called onRelease not XonRelease . I think the 'X' was a typographic error in Jamie's tuturial. Having said all this, I don't think this will help you solve your \"Invalid Credentials\" problem, as I doesn't for me either. The ldap stuff you get when searching in Google for \"Invalid credentials\" has got nothing to do this with problem. I am not even using ldap for authentication and I assume you are neither. For some reason, the session that is created in moodleService.init() and stored in _$SESSION, can not be accessed when moodleService.send_response is called. Where did it go? What happened to it? Did it NOT get created in moodleService.init()? These are questions I am trying to answer. The whole thing is complicated by the fact that \"most of the time\" it works fine (for me).

I was thinking that perhaps we could have it tied to the courses table so that an admin could simply drag \"possible\" classes for the next semester from one box to the next, much like you add teachers to courses or what-have-you.  Each student would get two votes, or, better yet, have some kind of instant-runoff setup, and be able to view what classes are getting the most votes.  If they want to change their vote so that they can shift the balance from one course to another (and they don't think the course they REALLY want will be taught that semester) up until a cutoff date. Is anyone else working on such an idea?",

To be precise, I want to change the course completion gas gauge report so that it also shows the city/town profile field (I'm using that field to store our office locations and want to be able to group our staff into their offices in my reports).  I am using Moodle 2.5 and the site is being managed by our server technician so he has access to make code changes. Is this something that I (or my tech guy) could change easily or would I be better not to meddle with existing reports? I would be keen to hear from others who have tried/achieved this.

For that situation, I'd recommend making the fields that are displayed configurable with the report, so users could decide which ones they want displayed. mike",

From what I can see, there are several reports in ELIS that provide almost all of the information we would need, but none that provide all of it in one report. Any advice from others who have already worked with ELIS reports would be most helpful. Either way, I'll certainly keep this post updated with our progress. John",

I'm prefectly happy to comment that I think a database in moodle should be able to handle this - but that is completely meaningless information as I have no experience. If there is no library plugin already contributed, there are not likely to be many people on the contributed plugins forum following such a discussion. but just a glance at the forum, about 4-5 discussions down from your original post was one about OpenBiblio plugin which seems ideal for you to look into. Perhaps a quick search rather than sarcastic comments about people, in what is a very supportive and helpful community, not responding immediately might be useful. Richard",

I wrote a little block to show students if they have any books they should bring back and a link to the library search. In the library, the counter and the catalog computers there run Webconverger , which I can recommend to everyone if they need something that just runs a browser.

Ya he revisado el tema de permisos un montón de veces, he incluso me he instalado moodle en local tanto en windows como en ubuntu y funcionaba perfectamente, pero en el servidor en cuestión no hay manera. El servidor es una máquina con debian fetch, php5, mysql y apache2; y moodle funciona perfectamente. La única diferencia que he observado es que moodle está instalado en /var/data/www/moodle, y no en /var/www/moodle, pero bueno, no se si esto influirá en que moodle se de cuenta de que hay un nuevo modulo copiado en el correspondiente directorio.

          "Text": "* Some of my work required to carry out some type of preregistration (search) for the entity (school / company) could select the right audience for your courses or events. When using systems like Joomla, you can perform this kind of task because there are many plugins for it. The fact is that once I came across a situation, unexpected for me, one of those \"surveys\" had a demand very high, it made the database of Joomla stay overwhelmed and consequently there was a fall of link several times. After that I started to evaluate the use of these tools and came to the conclusion that we were getting much \"garbage\" accumulated in our database; were the information that served only for research (preregistration). As a result, I decided to change the way we conduct these events ( preregistration / search ), using a feature that would free the database. It was once developed a tool for this purpose, it is a registration system (preregistration) based on the storage of information on XML files. For a while I used the feature and was very good to me and the companies I worked, we had no more problems with the database. However, this \"tool\", stood in my files (backups) for a few years. Some time ago, I remembered her and I decided to give a \"polished\" in the codes. The result of this work is the XAMALEON (Soordle.org part of the project). A system ( Open Source ) modular, multi-languages, all built in PHP and XML . It can work in parallel to any platform (Joomla, Moodle etc.) You have on your site. With this system it is possible to perform pre-registration online without any impairment in its other applications. Fully configurable and with possible expansion without major difficulties. Anyway, I could talk a lot about the system here, but I think that is not the case now. In the desire to contruibuir with the Moodle community, please know that the system is available for download at: www.eadgames.com.br If you want to see a video example of the system being up and running: I hope this \"feature\" will be useful somehow to distance learning professionals. * google translator",

However, we are running in to some problems with a few users (teachers and students). These users are able to log in to Moodle fine, but get an \"Invalid email. Unable to process your request at this time, please try again later\" message from Google. Their Google Apps user is never created then. I contacted Google support and they believe that the first time the user logged in and attempted to go to a Google App, their account creation failed for some reason, but that Moodle must have flagged it in some way as being successful so it doesn't attempt to create the account again. Does anyone know if this is truly how Moodle handles these accounts, and which table/column that setting would be held in so I could change it? Also, if this is the case, is there something we can change in Moodle so it doesn't flag the account unless it was truly successful? I'd appreciate any help or insight! Thanks, Jill",

The short version of my need is that we want the Google Apps usernames to include either the student or teacher domain , as appropriate (i.e. teacher@ school.com or student@ schoolstu.org ) . A few specifics for our situation: Moodle 2.4 Google Apps for Education account in place Two domains verified - all certs and keys in place (as far as I can tell) Primary domain (teachers/admin) - school .com Secondary domain (students) - schoolstu .org I have mainly used the instructions from: http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Google_Apps_Integration and https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=202476 but have read everything else that I could find. I was under the impression that a student logged into Moodle and could then click one of the links in the Google Apps block and immediately be logged into his Google Apps account (and that that account would be created at that point if it did't already exist). That hasn't been the case, but we do get the following: Using the Google User Sync Block - I add a user to the list of users being synced Run the moodlename/blocks/gdata/cron.php Student is created as a google user and can then follow the Google apps link into his shiny new Google account. (It appears that the student needs to have logged into Moodle between steps 1 and 2 for step 3 to work) This is all well and good and would suffice - except that the Google user name is generated as username@ school.com for both teachers and students, where we would like for the student accounts to be created using the student domain (username@ schoolstu.org , in this instance). In Piers Harding's documentation at https://github.com/piersharding/moodle-google/blob/master/auth/gauth/README.txt , I read this: Multiple Domains: If you want to allow multiple domains access in, then set domainname to a comma delimited list of the valid domains. This will not work with the Enable GAPPS domain specific login option. Which sounds pretty close to what we want, but I may be reading too much into it. Our problem has not been allowing the two domains' users into Google, but rather assigning their usernames in Google based on their domain - using their email addresses, basically. The last post in the discussion: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=158882 Sounded promising, but did not work for me. Any ideas? I can supply whatever more information would help. Thanks in advance! David",

One student reads the question on their card to another student. That student then answers. The first student checks their answer and then they swap roles. On the question side I have perhaps: a) an answer to a question in English - and the student must make a question b) a phrase in Japanese - and the student must say it in English c) a sentence in English - and the tense or some other grammatical aspect needs to be changed. It works surprisingly well, my students are used to doing it and enjoy it. Also if I have a few minutes extra in a class, or as a warm up, I can ask the students to use an old set of flashcards for review. So we don't use the leitner feature, and I don't have any stats, but I am very happy with it.",

          "Text": "Hi Jong-Dae, Thanks for trying out the FLAX module. Ms Shaoqun Wu is on maternity leave. I'll be answering questions in the forum. To use FLAX for teaching a particular language, you can 1) use texts in the language to build collections; 2) create language activities out of the texts in the collection. FLAX collections can be built using texts of many languages (including the three languages mentioned in your post). But, for FLAX activities to be practiced in languages other than English, a parser of the language is needed to successfully identify certain parts of the text of the language. For example, verbs, nouns, etc.. As to your question, you CAN build collections using texts in Korean. You will then be able to search and browse documents in the collection. To use FLAX language activities in teaching Korean, however, you'll need a Korean parser. As it for now, you could still go ahead and build a collection using texts in languages other than English. The texts in the collection will be parsed by the English parser (the only available parser in FLAX at the moment). The English parser relies on white space to segment words and full stop to identify sentences. If the language does not possess similar nature, the activities in the collection won't even be doing the basics, let alone identifying word/sentence types of the language. To better understand this, go to a collection that we built using texts of a New Zealand native Maori language called Te Wharekura . Activities in this collection are created using the English parser, hence they are much simpler and don't have the options like word types, sentence types etc., compared our standard Password collection which is in English. The activities in the collection Te Wharekura are only basically functional because the language also has white space between words and a full stop character at the end of each sentence like English. It doesn't hurt to build a collection yourself using texts in whatever language you are interested in. Then you'd understand what I've said even better. Hope that's answered your question. cheers, Xiaofeng",

I have tried to build from the 'Manage my FLAX collection' button in the FLAX Activity, but no luck al all. Yesterday I was able to input some text, but the collection was not built as expected. Today I tried again, it stopped after I typed the description of the collection. 2. I have also tried to install a server locally. It seems that certain packages, such as ant, tomcat6 are required before running 'Greenstone-FLAX1.0-linux'. I am using Ubuntu 9.10, the server program went through the installation processes. The Greenstone was placed at /usr/local/Greenstone3. But tomcat6 and ImagMagik are not install as expected. I tried running 'sudo sh gs3-server.sh' and got errors : gs3-server.sh: 44: pushd: not found gs3-server.sh: 45: source: not found gs3-server.sh: 46: popd: not found gs3-server.sh: 50: search4j: not found I did try installing in other machines with tomcat6, ant, maven2 preinstalled. The behaviors are totally different. Could you please provide more details in server installation ? Thanks.",

          "Text": "Hi Panyarak, Thanks for trying out FLAX. To answer your first question, I need more information in order to figure out what went wrong when you tried to build a collection. I've just tried building a collection myself in the FLAX Sandbox course on our demo site. It works all fine for me. Please elaborate at which step, the actions you took, and how the program reacted to your actions. As to your second question, I must say that we have only tested the server installation on Ubuntu 8.10 and no higher. You wrote: > But tomcat6 and ImagMagik are not install as expected. Could you please check in /usr/local/Greenstone3/packages directory and see whether this contains a folder called tomcat and a zip file called apache-tomcat-6.0.*.zip? (Where * can be anything.). That'll tell you whether tomcat has been installed or not. Ant 1.7.1 and tomcat 6 are supposed to be installed for you when you installed the server. You wrote that you were trying to run: > sudo sh gs3-server.sh Did you install FLAX in a special location that it required you to run it with \"sudo\"? Is there a location that you can install it in that will allow you to run the command directly with: > ./gs3-server.sh This is the way we have been testing it on Ubuntu 8.10 here. Instead of running the gs3-server.sh program, could you try running the following from a terminal (from the top level installation folder, in your case it'd be /usr/local/Greenstone3): > source gs3-setup.sh (this command sets up environment) > ant start (this starts the tomcat server) (the command to stop the server is: ant stop) This should start tomcat directly and also give you messages as to whether tomcat failed to start and why. If it worked, you would be able to open a browser and go to the http://[ host -name-you-specified]:[port-number]/ to see whether tomcat works. (The host-name value might be localhost for instance, and the default port is 8080 unless you specifically changed these settings in build.properties.) If that works, the next step is to point your browser to http://[host-name-you-specified]:[port-number]/greenstone3/flax and see whether the flax home page works as well. Hope that helps cheers, Xiaofeng",

I'm basically thinking of one \"master-course\" or \"main-course\" filled with the aggregate learning content. The students must now - before entering a course - do a test (if you focus on prior knowledge) or a questionnaire (if you focus p.e. on learning styles). For the next step you must write an add-on, so that the result of the test/questionnaire will allocate the student to an individual course with individual learning content. So far the idea. I know from one scientific paper that such an add-on already exists, but I have never found it here on moodle page. I you have suggestions/ideas for writing the add-on, I would be very appreciate if we could share knowledge. Best regards.",

I have webpa working fine, but not the SSO between Moodle and WebPA.  The documentation is very poor in this respect. I had a look in the Moodle database , and in the local_simplesso_sites table I found a reference to a file https://[mymoodle.server]/webpa/api2/sso.php This api2 directory is non-existent in the WebPA download ! This module was developed by my university, and is working fine there.  I can tell that their WebPA server does contain the api2 directory. This is all very confusing.  At present it appears that the WebPA Moodle module as available by public download is broken but it is working fine at UNSW where I work. There are clearly pieces missing from the WebPA github repository. Is this a customisation that the developers don't want to share?  Or has the public code just not been properly updated yet? Has anyone out there in Moodle land been able to get this to work?  I will try to find out more from my contacts at uni on Monday.",

When cancelling the form I would like to return to my activity's view.php.

When dumping after if ($mform->is_cancelled()) it does not dump anything. I would appreciate if someone could help me with this. Kind regards Simon",

It has been this way for a few days.  When I check the cron logs I see this: Running s:22:\"user_activity_etl_cron\";() from eliscoreplugins_user_activity... Calculating user activity from Moodle log * processing records from time:0 to time:1327531662 * processing records from time:1327531662 to time:1327531662 * processing records from time:1327531662 to time:1327531662 * processing records from time:1327531662 to time:1327531662 * processing records from time:1327531662 to time:1327531662 It appears that the ETL process is stuck at this point because all subsequent cron runs show the same timestamp.  I looked at the mdl_log table and I have two records with that timestamp for the same user viewing two different courses. Has anyone else seen this and if so what did you do to get past it? Thanks, Scott",

I have ideas and needs for a couple of plug-ins that I am interested in developing and I've seen posts in the forums where other users are looking for the same thing I am.

It does not matter whether you are developing the plugin for a client or for the general public. However, the GPL does not require you to distribute your plugin publicly, it only requires that you include the source code whenever, and to whoever, you supply the program to (in the case of Moodle plugins , the source code is the program, so this isn't an issue) and that the recpipient can freely modify and distribute the code (if they wish - a paying client may decide to keep the code to themselves, but that is up to them). To get back to the original question - the Moodle jobs database (see link above) was orignally a place to ask for people to do specific jobs and a place to advertise availabilty for work. However, as only Moodle Partners are allowed to use the Moodle trademark to advertise for work (\"I'd like to develop this Moodle plugin, who will pay me?\" would probably fall foul of this restriction), the second part of the functionality was removed (at last check you could still enter your availability, but it is not displayed).",

You can manually create an activity backup, download it from Moodle and upload to the server, or you can use the backup.php(Moodle 2.7) script to create a backup on the command line. You need to supply backup.php with resource's module id and a filename. Then you supply filename and course id for the target course. Actually I just noticed there is also an import.php (Moodle 4.4) command that should copy the resource to a new course in one line, but I have not tried it. Several great scripts have been added gradually. Unfortunately if you were not aware of them, then they are not documented as they ought. There is very brief mention of backup/restore in Administration via command line . and import and other commands are missing. Daniel",

I always enjoy solving these cases by using a PHP script that automates the process and creates activities in a customized way, as needed. And the best part: it gives me total control and efficiency! 🚀 Here’s an overview of how I usually handle this: I create `.php` files that perform the necessary actions. First, I call the native `create_course()` function to create the course and trigger the necessary events. \n```text\n<?php\n\nrequire_once(\"../config.php\");\nrequire_once(\"{$CFG->\ndirroot\n}/course/lib.php\");\nrequire_once(\"{$CFG->dirroot}/mod/resource/lib.php\");\nrequire_once(__DIR__ . \"/lib.php\");\nrequire_once(\"{$CFG->dirroot}/course/modlib.php\");\n\n$file = \"/path/to/your/file/my_file.pdf\"; // Path to the file to be uploaded\n$courses = [2, 3, 4]; // Course IDs\n\nforeach ($courses as $courseid) {\n    $\ncontext\n = context_course::instance($courseid);\n    $fs = get_file_storage();\n\n    $fileinfo = [\n        \"contextid\" => $context->id,\n        \"component\" => \"mod_resource\",\n        \"filearea\" => \"content\",\n        \"itemid\" => 0,\n        \"filepath\" => \"/\",\n        \"filename\" => \"my_file.pdf\"\n    ];\n\n    $draftitemid = $fs->create_file_from_pathname($fileinfo, $file);\n\n    $data = new stdClass();\n    $data->course = $courseid;\n    $data->name = \"Resource Name\";\n    $data->intro = \"\";\n    $data->introformat = FORMAT_HTML;\n    $data->coursemodule = create_course_module($courseid, \"resource\", 1);\n    $data->files = $draftitemid;\n\n    // Set the display options to the site defaults.\n    $config = get_config(\"resource\");\n    $data->display = $config->display;\n    $data->popupheight = $config->popupheight;\n    $data->popupwidth = $config->popupwidth;\n    $data->printintro = $config->printintro;\n    $data->showsize = (isset($config->showsize)) ? $config->showsize : 0;\n    $data->showtype = (isset($config->showtype)) ? $config->showtype : 0;\n    $data->showdate = (isset($config->showdate)) ? $config->showdate : 0;\n    $data->filterfiles = $config->filterfiles;\n\n    resource_add_instance($data, null);\n\n    echo \"File successfully uploaded to course ID {$courseid}! \\n\";\n}\n\nfunction create_course_module($course, $modulename, $sectionid) {\n    list($module, $context, $cw, $cm, $data) = prepare_new_moduleinfo_data($course, $modulename, $sectionid);\n\n    $coursemodule = $data->id = add_course_module($data);\n\n    return $coursemodule;\n}\n```\n After running this script, the PDF file will be added to the three courses! You can further customize this by adding descriptions, setting permissions, and even notifying students. Eduardo Kraus Professor and Programmer",

Have you tried using one of the other methods mentioned in this forum which use published scripts? They are much safer as they use well reviewed  and tested code. Daniel",

We have filed a ticket at github: https://github.com/jmcgettrick/MoodleDirectV2/issues/105 I am posting separately in this thread because I am afraid the issue has gotten buried in the previous thread. We have tried numerous versions of the plugin, including 2014012402, 2014012403_QA3, 2014012407 and 2014012408. We have verified the problem in a \"plain vanilla\" install of Moodle 2.6.4 and 2.7.2+. In all cases, the connection to the Turnitin service is working, grades, originality scores, etc. appear correctly within the Turnitin assignment plugin page, but grades are never displayed in the Moodle grade book. We have tried tweaking the post date to force a refresh, etc. Within the database , mdl_turnitintooltwo_submissions.submission_grade contains value and mdl_grade_items table does contain a row for turnitintooltwo assignment\ncreated above, mdl_grade_items.hidden contains a date value, but it has\npassed. There is no corresponding row in mdl_grade_grades for the assignment. Has anyone gotten Turnitin grades to post from this plugin to the gradebook in Moodle 2.6 at all?",

We have a few instances where the grade in the Turnitin GradeMark does not get transferred to the Moodle GradeBook. However, it is working for most assignments.  As soon as the assignment has been graded in TII, the grade gets automatically transferred to the Moodle GradeBook but only shows up for the student after the Post Date.  The Intructor/Teachers sees it in the GradeBook as soon as it has been transferred.  The only issue is that the student DOES see the GradeBook 'Course Total' by default so can work out what the assignment grade is before the Post Date has passed.  It is thus important to hide the Moodle GradeBook course total! Turnitin support have suggested that the issue with particular grades getting stuck in the GradeMark and not being transferred over to the Moodle GradeBook has been fixed in New version: 201401240 8 We are in the process of testing that at the moment. Do none of the grades get transferred over to the Moodle GradeBook? best wishes, Aleks",

By way of starting this, I will list our current method, and hopefully may bring out some better \"best practise\" for all flash implementations. Using products like Camtasia, Captivate and of course flash. 1. Camtasia and Captivate: Camtasia and Captivate outputs have incorporated html, preloaders, flash file. Method: 1.1. navigate to the output directory, zip all the files in the directory. 1.2 upload and upzip the zip file into the course file area 1.3 In the Moodle course area, use the resource to create a link to an html file to hook to the html file produced by camtasia and captivate.",

Use the ?w=800&h=600 code at the end of the link to control the size. (I still don't see this as the swf always is fitted to the size window opened - what is that?) 2.4 Select if you want to open in new window or show as a framed window. The way to control the size is actually ?d=800x600. This would give a size of width 800 times height 600. The default in 1.7 and 1.8 if the d parameter is not used is width 400 times height 300.

          "Text": "As you say Camtasia / Flash / most applications that generate Flash will also generate an html file. Probably the easiest and secure way to get your Flash file into Moodle is to upload those files either individually or as a zip to your course files area and link to them as a resource. Unfortunately this means you'll be using frames or a popup window or the resource will open in the same window with no navigation. This linking as a resource does mean that if you link directly to the swf the parameters like the user first name and last name can be passed into the swf. And you can control the size of the popup window. So I think a popup window would be the best option available for many situations. Some users do find popups a little difficult to deal with but it would be easy to include a button in your movie 'close this window', to make things easier for them.",

It would let you control how the Flash file was embedded in the page - width, height parameters etc. And you could pass simple parameters to the flash movie - Username, Course Name, etc, same as with the current resource. We could take advantage of the new UFO js library that is included in the Moodle header and used to embed Flash elsewhere. The advantage of using the UFO js library is that it will get rid of that annoying 'you have to click this resource first' before you can use it stuff that you see in IE .",

Camtasia will produce not just a single swf, but a series of swfs, one being a \"container\" with a srubber and preloader, and the others being avaialable to be loaded into the container. Data about the others swf's is contained in an xml file that is loaded into the container. The problem is that the url for the swf's are relative and moodle can't resolve relative links within a swf. There are two possible solutions: Camtasia can produce an older swf, which produces a single file. You can link to this fine. Publish your file as a SCORM and upload into moodle as a SCORM or IMS content package, then the links should resolve. I think there are other solutions, but they won't work with backup and restore.",

          "Text": "Hello community! Just taking a chance to post a quick announcement here - a new version of the  'Adaptive Quiz' plugin, 2.5.0, has just been released! Check the release notes here - https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_adaptivequiz/2.5.0/38020 The main new feature is enabling Moodle's text editor for custom attempt feedback, the user manual can be found in the plugin's wiki here - https://github.com/vtos/moodle-mod_adaptivequiz/wiki/Custom-Attempt-Feedback This has been a demanded feature for quite a long time, I'm happy this has become available now. Also, check out the placeholders feature there 😉 The plugin still supports Moodle up to version 4.5 only, the plugin is still not compatible with Moodle 5.x due to the question bank changes. However, this is exactly what the next release will focus on. Another good news is that now the plugin supports MSSQL ! The support is experimental though, it's not covered by full manual testing. But from further releases, full MS SQL support will become a plugin's feature inevitably, without the word 'experimental'. This new version doesn't bring the new custom feedback feature to Moodle 4.1 and 4.0. Please, leave your requests under this post if you're still planning to use Moodle 4.0 or 4.1, but would like to have this new feature, and it will be considered for further releases. Thank you for using the plugin and helping to make it better, happy Moodle-ing!",

For online meeting, that activity may be used with included optional conferencing integrations using either Jitsi meet or the system in Deft response block or with an external conferencing system alongside the activity.  The activity can be configured to adjust for different types of meetings. The code is now available at https://GitHub.com/dthies/moodle-mod_plenum .

So far I have only tested with the Deft integration on my private development server, but will try the Jitsi stuff in the next day or two. I can grant access to anyone who wants to try it out, but doesn't want to install or set it up themselves. In fact, yesterday, I was setting up a, Plenary, activity in a course and was logged in with four accounts, when I received a message from Daniel. I invited him to join me, which he kindly did using another teacher account I already had available. He talked me through the final setup steps that I needed to get audio and video working. Next thing I knew, three and a half hours had gone by. The parliamentary procedure capabilities worked just like they were supposed to but to me the best part was the Deft block that provided the audio and video capabilities. In the past, I have struggled for days to get other video plugins to work with very little success. The, Plenary plugin with Deft, just worked! All I had to do was the usual plugin installs, set a couple of options, and enable audio and video and everything just worked for hours! One of the things I used to enjoy when I was going to a brick and mortar college, was showing up for class early and talking to everyone as they came in before the class started. If you have a scheduled online class time, with this setup you can even do that! It does help to have an, Online users, block set up so that you can see if anyone is there in the course. Once they've used this setup, they would just know to go ahead and click, Join, and do some chatting while waiting for everyone else to log in. There were some other possibilities that we discussed, but my eyes are doing their usual imitation of sandpaper from too much screen time already, today, so I better quit and go pamper them.",

          "Text": "For forming collaborative learning communities, Moodle is it. But looking down the road a bit I'll probably want to move into content that isn't really the focus of an online learning environment: product reviews, \"personals\" variation, News (I mean not just announcements kind of news but a whole news section) and a few other things. Anyone have some experience using the different types of MOODLE-CMS integrations like Mambo-Moodle, Moodle4Xoops and pnMoodle? I've experimented with postnuke quite a bit and here's what I see: 1) A lot of powerful tools. Unfortunately my favorites are \"dead\" projects. 2) A powerful but byzantive templating system called Xanthia.  Sometimes doing the simplest thing is so complicated and involved 10 steps.  But it is very configurable ... 3) My biggest complaint is when you make a site all your menus are organized according to database and program structure rather than according to topics, so if I want to organize my links according to topics both for users and search engines I have to do everything manually anyway.  So if I want my \"Basketweaving 101\" course to have a basketweaving-topical menu (like basketweaving-books, basektweaving-news, basketweaving-product reviews, basketweaving matchmakers)  This is very difficult to do in pn (pnmoodle). How about Mambo-Moodle and Moodle4Xoops? How well do they they integrate with Moodle and a topic-oriented or group-oriented site? How easy is it to customize their templates assuming you know just html and css ?",

Using an overall integration technology called AAIRS (\"Automatic Authorization, Integration and Real-Time Synchronization\"), McGraw-Hill offers real-time integration between Tegrity and Moodle (and many other LMSes) at no cost. Through the use of a Moodle Block and a drag-and-drop configured connector within Tegrity, AAIRS enables single-sign on access to Tegrity for students and faculty. The real-time connection between Tegrity and Moodle ensures that user, role, course and enrollment data are always up to date, so there's no need to manually enter users or courses, or schedule recordings at the start of each semester.

Also included is Postini that allows you (assuming you are in a school or similar institute) to quarantine mail with foul language etc. It is quite tricky to set-up, but on the other hand it is free and a very good piece of software. Have a look around the forum as a lot of installation information has been posted. Regards Dominic Bond",

There are 8 individual courses (weeks) and at the end of each week is a Quiz. If the Student scores 80% or higher the feedback they are given includes a 'secret character' (letter or number). The eight of these, when joined together, provide the enrolment key to a final course which has nothing in it but the Certificate (using the add-in Certificate module). You could do the same if using Moodle Quizzes, or potentially using SCORM objects - if they allow this feedback after reaching an appropriate score.",

I have a wish list of what I would like to achieve, and looking for most suitable plugins option for templates. I would like to have course which is action plan and result oriented. I understand all of  requirements may not be possible through one plugin and will each will have its pros and cons.. Here is the detail : I have some templates or forms ,that I would like student to fill ,track, review and print. Example of this can be Job Search action plan..Which is a form, where student can set their job search goals for Search, Resume, Networking etc Then student can explain ,with SMART goals techniques (Specefic,Measurable achievable,Relevant and timely) to explain their plan and how to achieve and track their progress. The students can use text as well as images to add in the plan Also, they can track their progress with time frames listed in goal plan. lastly ,they can print it and keep  for offline. I can use a Questionnaire or a Lesson plan which partly fulfills the need. Experts suggestions are greatly appreciated for plugin and examples. Any one with similar example /experience can also be a great help. warm regards Sushil (Edited by Helen Foster to remove website link, since unsolicited advertising is not allowed according to the site policy - original submission Wednesday, 2 March 2016, 7:31 PM)",

And I purged the cache each time, just in case). I'm still wondering how is the header text wrapped?  I tried looking for something (like 'white-space:pre-wrap') in locallib.php and styles. css , but can't find anything.  Do you know how to 'unwrap' the text (sorry, I know I asked this already)?

Adobe Captivate 4 (high-end proprietary http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate/ ) does this but so does Camstudio (open source http://camstudio.org/ ).",

So, with a few hacks to the theme CSS and some of the PHP in Moodle I was able to accomplish that.  I don't like the idea of it just being a hack and something that I will have to do again in each upgrade.  I'm still new to Moodle so I need some time to catch up to the structure and code setup in the project so I have submitted the idea, with code snippets of what I did, to the tracker.  If you are interested in having an option like this as an administration option please vote for it, comment, or offer some code help.  Thanks https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-43692",

I have tried to insert a flashcard activity, but the cards never show up, only the text on a \"clickable\" field, that is, when I click the question, the answer is revealed. I am having trouble making sense of the following: To customize this instance of flashcard, get the stylesheet beneath, edit it and save it within the moddata/flashcard /<instance> directory in the course's files. If you use images as background, save them in the same place, and invoke them with their simple names As a manager I have access to mod/flashcard . Where exactly is the stylesheet placed? Does one make a new stylesheet every time a flash activity is inserted in a course?",

The files I would want to do this with are ones students may want to view or listen to many times, for example when analysing a short clip for multiple film techniques. If they need to answer 4 or 5 questions about it they will need to watch it a few times. I liked your Demo course too - might email you off-forum about it.",

The block will be added to the bottom of the right hand column by default. You can move it by clicking on the arrow icons under the header of the block. Hope this helps, Marty P.S. If you want to add this block to all courses by default you can add it as a 'sticky block' . On your main Moodle homepage, go to Site Administration > Modules > Blocks > Sticky blocks . Select 'Course page' from the drop down menu that appears. Add the Simple Navigation block to this page in the position you want it to appear on each course home page.",

I need to populate all of our student accounts into google apps. We need to provision certain users access to only parts of google apps platform (the elementary principal wants to control grade level email access). I found today that I could populate all accounts from ldap to moodle with the auth_ldap_sync_users.php which worked like a charm. Combined with the enrol sync I was able to get all users in moodle and enrolled in their appropriate classes (both really cool and will be looking to work into my site cron job list to keep users and course enrollments current). From here though I run into a problem. I run the gdata/cron.php and no new accounts are created. Just a long list of Authentication errors. Upon looking into the user database ( mysql ) I see that there are no stored passwords. Only after a user logs in, does moodle store a password from ldap. Is there a way to get auth_ldap_sync_users.php to also bring in the user passwords. I believe this might then allow the gdata/cron.php to all creation of new user accounts.

After extracting the udutu plugin files so that I have a folder structure ..../moodle/mod/udutu/db ..../moodle/mod/udutu/datamodels etc. I logged on as the administrator and clicked on Notification. I then got the rather confusing display of At the top of the screen \"No warnings - Scroll to the continue button\" but beneath that the message \"Tried to modify database but \"c:\\program files\\apache group\\ apache2\\htdocs\\moodle/mod/udutu/db/postgres7. sql \" does not exist!\" \"udutu tables could NOT be set up successfully!\" 1. Does your module work with postgreSQL 8.2? 2. Does your installation script need to be modified so that the path being looked for does not contain a combination of \"\\\" and \"/\" ? 3. Is there an issue with recognising the version of postgeSQL being used. I know that moodle does not appear to differentiate between version 7 or 8 hence possibly the reason why your install script was looking for a postgreSQL 7 file. Any help would be appreciated. Kind regards Johnathan",

I have a Moodle 3.4 version and I would like courses that I have there upload on some other web application which is actually something like some repo with all kind of school material. So let's say Moodle is \"A\" and that other web repo with education materials is \"B\". So some teacher wants that material from \"A\" is published on \"B\". Is it possible with HUB server ? I do have on development Moodle server installed hub, but it was installed by my college who was working on Moodle before me, and I can't find anywhere how to register that other site \"B\" which is not Moodle but some custom web application(repo), that should accept materials from \"A\" Moodle. And I see that Hub is not supported anymore after 3.4 version of Moodle. So please help, if anyone has a similar problem. Thank you.",

I used to run a HUB ... matter of fact it was (at one time) the only other public HUB displayed (TCEA).  It was mega administration.  Purpose of HUB is to allow teachers from other Moodle sites to publish a backup of their courses to a HUB.  Other teachers from other sites could then search the HUB and (depending upon settings for the entry) download a no user backup of the course to install in their moodle or sign up for the course on the server where it resides. A HUB didn't really contain courses and did require the setup of a dedicated Moodle instance. I think, from your description, you need to look again at LTI Provider.  That is built into Moodle 3.1 and you say you can't upgrade to that version.   Then run under a version where the plugin is compatible ... but know that means potential security issues ... a non-supported instance of a Moodle or the plugin itself could be the security issue/concern. Please see: https://docs.moodle.org/22/en/LTI_Provider https://moodle.org/plugins/local_ltiprovider Also see: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=193355 I see you desire to publish to an LTI server that is NOT a moodle.   That does present some issues of compatibility. https://www.imsglobal.org/toolcompare.html It might help to know something about that other LTI server you hint at but didn't disclose. External info: https://www.imsglobal.org/learning-tools-interoperability-resources BTW ... am not an LTI expert. ;) 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

Why it matters ... if it's just resources (audio/video/PDF's/Docs, etc.), one could take advantage (depending upon your situation/classification) of things like Google and Google Drive.   Could get unlimited space or affordable space for many many many Gigs of resources.   This would not be LTI, but a simple link whereby control to the resource is on the Google end. Example: I do admin for a public school in Texas and charge a fee for services.   I setup a spreadsheet in my Google Drive that was really 'billing information' ... what work done and how much the ISD was to expect in fees.   Right on the ISD Moodle instance in a course for System Admins only, had two links to that sheet.   One for me where I could edit and another that was read only for the school staff.  In order to edit, one had to login to Google with the proper credentials. If your entity qualifies, could be a Google for Education domain ... which opens all sorts of possibilities. 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

If you need to have your Turntiin account timezone checked / adjusted you would need to put a ticket into the Turnitin helpdesk and one of our product specialists can take it from there. The way the plug in deals with timezones is by making sure the Moodle default timezone is in sync with the timezone of you Turnitin account. Any individual user accounts that use a different timezone to the default Moodle timezone are adjusted accordingly. The most common reason I see this error is where the timezone is not quite right and Moodle displays the start date in one timezone but Turnitin logs it in another. That can result in a discrepancy where Turnitin beleives the assignment hasn't yet started. Hope that helps.",

This is the only way I have used this plugin since 1.9 version. Before, until 2.3 version we had the option Dialogue type to set teacher-student dialogues. Very wise option. Now this setting is gonne, I cannot imagine why, and it's said that we can get the job done by playing with role capabilities. Well it seems not so easy, as I'm having the same problem as Faisal and Austin. I think would to be very nice to have another answer on this subject, even if it's to say there's no solution and to ask us to open an issue on tracker or something. The lack of answer gives the idea that maybe there is a solution or that we are missing something on the previous posts. TIA Daniel",

All calculations will be performed by example with Matlab. A certain amount of tolerance will be accepted on each numerical answer. I don't want to compute answers with Moodle because formulaes are too much complicated. Despite my research, I didn't find a plugin to achieve this. To clarify, I would provide the input data: a = [1; 3.4; 5.6] b = [2.7; 5.9; 4.8] c = [1; 2; 3] I would provide a text like this: Either the transfer function $ H (s) = \\ frac {{a}} {{b} s {c}} $, calculate its rise time. H (s) = \\ frac {{a}} {{b} {c}} s \"Moodle\" will randomly choose an index, such as index 2 . The variables a, b, c would be then equal to 3.4; 5.9; 2 . {a}, {b} and {c} would be automatically replaced in my text and my Latex expressions. I also would supply the answer vector: rise_time = [9.8; 3.4; 7; 8] and a tolerance, ie 1% The student should answer: 3.4 +/- 1% (index vector 2). Ideally, It would be great if I could ask multiple questions (so I would have an answer vector for each question), ie response time, peak time, etc. The data would be provided via a csv file.

The lack of support for importing Examview questions is a MAJOR shortfall for Moodle. I have done the research on why it does not work and have talked to fscreations about the removal of the XML export. Currently, fscreations claims that the blackboard export work around is an acceptable way to do this. This is nonsense, since it does not handle equations, graphs or other graphics. I appeal to the Moodle community to help me solve this problem. I am a developer and recognize the difficulty in the current import of EV questions, but it seems that it can be solved. I truely believe that this integration is vital to the integration of Moodle for most math teachers. It might be that if enough of us go to the fscreations forum and post their need, they might listen. http://forum.fscreations.com/index.php?showtopic=1215 Please help with this, I truely believe that this is a vital enhancement that we should take very seriously for the progress of Moodle as a classroom solution.

So, realistically, something will only happen if someone who needs this does the 'scratch your own itch' thing. Question import/export is not rocket science. All the code is in question/format/*, question/format.php, question/import.php and question/export.php. All you have to do is parse the import file, and then massage the data into the structure Moodle expects.",

          "Text": "Hi Ehsan, It depends on your operating system. On Linux for example, you and your web server need read (r) and write (w) permissions to the files and directories in order to install or delete a plugin. To just use the plugin, your web server just needs read permissions. Some people think that you also need the execute (x) permissions on PHP files however this is not required. PHP files are not executed by the operating system. They read and interpreted by PHP. Therefore, only read permissions are required. However, you do need execute (x) permissions on the directory in order to be able to delete files and directories (i.e. uninstall plugins). These permissions can be configured using ownership (o) or group (g) membership (recommended). You could also do it using other (o) but this is not recommended for security reasons. As for which directory, that depends on the type of plugin you are installing. For example, a module will be installed in /mod, a filter in /filters, a block in /blocks, an enrolment plugin in /enrol, a report in /report, etc.. Unlike some applications like Drupal, there is no separate directory for plugins that you add to Moodle. If you are running your server on Windows, things are similar but a little different. If this is your case, let us know or consult the documentation for your particular platform. Hope you find this helpful.",

Also get familiar with Google analytics and/or piwik because much of such work is looking after traffic rather than educating. On balance I am more interested in educating. In the main two years I was selling that I could have only just bought a modest small car with all the money earned (note that there were several years in the production of the material prior to that). The key to that was probably that at the time of launch it was the only book available on that specific version of the exam and I had built a reputation as the go to person on the subject. Sufficient that real world publishers approached me to co-author books on the topic.  The books produced were better for the ego than the bank balance.",

Right at the moment, I think my biggest problem is the red5 server itself. There are some conflicting installation guides out there and quite frankly, not having written directions for installation and setup on the red5.org site to me is a problem. Every other source of written directions, has had at least one error that I have had to try an muddle through fixing. One of the things that really bums me out is the videos about red5, none seem to be about installation. My server is running Centos 6.3 with SELinux set to enforcing. I suspect that I may have permission problems and so far, I have not found any installation guide that even mentions red5 server permission settings at all. Oh well, this is just for personal use, so I will keep plugging along between other projects. AL",

Please check you have updated the version or your RAP files.\" This error was due to inadvertently forgetting to include the RAP version.php file in the root html folder with the rest of the RAP files, that need to be there. The Red5 server is not accessible or not started: Permission denied (13 ). I eventually realized this was due to SELinux. With setenforce 0 the message changes to \"The streaming server is running and available.\" With setenforce 1 you get the aforementioned error message, even though the Language Lab works just fine. Since I would rather have SELinux set to enforcing, I just ignore the error warning.",

These have grown over time and are now large in number, making it difficult for students to find essential information. I wonder if anyone can recommend a plugin that could be a question 'repository' with a search and tag function? I've not been able to find anything comparable in Moodle but would welcome any suggestions. Ideally it would have a search box that you begin to type your query such as 'How do I upload an assignment' and all posts tagged or using the word 'assignment' would either be pulled into a display area and ranked. The aim is to remove the surrounding guidance to enable students to focus more on their studies.",

          "Text": "We ran Elluminate standalone for a year, planning to integrate with Moodle (but not getting around to it).  The recent purchase of Elluminate by Blackboard changed the interface and consequently all our user documentation was made redundant.  I can live with that, but the interface has also become more confusing which has caused problems for our second language learners. The most important feature was remote desktop sharing - allowing the teacher to remotely monitor what students were doing on their computers.  In our case this was monitoring (formally invigilating in fact) their progress on a Moodle Quiz.  This has become much harder and confusing now than before in the old Elluminate.  The licence cost is also a problem and we've suffered some downtime on Blackboard's servers (of course just when you're trying to run a class).  The Java application is also quite a hefty download each time. Now trialling Big Blue Button.  The interface is much cleaner and we have hosted in a RackSpace cloud server running Ubuntu integrated with Moodle 1.9.8.  Pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it and it allows for growth in capacity as you need it.  BBB looks promising for the new year.  We'll run the two side-by-side till our Blackboard product is up for licence renewal in March 2012. I reckon we'll go with BBB partly because once you get it running and integrated with Moodle you can create as many instants of it as you like.  That's right, you can create multiple classrooms for which you'd have to pay separate licences in Blackboard.  That effectively mutliplies the cost savings manyfold.  Breakout rooms doesn't appear to work in version .8 and I'm yet to test the recording function but we can live with these since I can see them on the planned development path. A tip: if you have Moodle running on a server you'll probably need to have BigBlue Button running on a separate server.  It may be technically possible to run the two together but it seems messy as they both operate on port 80 using different webservers.  This is why we went with a low-cost cloud server for our BBB.  Another reason was that the instructions given by BBB work well for Ubuntu, but would be tricky to translate to a different webhost platform.  So the cloud server method with Ubuntu pre-installed and then running (very carefully) through the installation instructions now takes me under 30 minutes.  And if I need to crank up the RAM I can easily do so to cope with higher usage needs.

It is necessary to go on http://www.ethnoinformatique.fr/course/view.php?id=123 to have the good version. But in this case , there is no file flashcard.css and there is an inversion between TAB and SP in field separator. 2/ I have a big problem with import . The first import works very fine but after it is not possible to import an other flashcard resource. I have the systematic error message : Course module is incorrect (in the same course or an other) And i notice this thing ( see the screens copies) , the shortname of the course in the navigation links change after a cancel in the import page (or a new import). Here , ALL-1-RL-GA is the course_id=2 in the system.",

I'd like my report to be able to print one page per user with the all of the quizzes and their scores in the currently selected course. So far what I have is the following Query (which may need some fine tuning yet to be perfectly honest): \n```text\nSELECT c.shortname, u.id, u.firstname AS 'Firstname' , u.lastname AS 'Lastname', cc.name AS 'Category', \n\n\nROUND(AVG(ROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2)), 2) AS Average,\n\n\nGROUP_CONCAT(\"<li>\",  gi.itemname, \": \", \n\n\nROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2), \"</li>\" SEPARATOR \"\") AS Grades\n\n\nFROM prefix_course AS c \n\n\nJOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid \n\n\nJOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id\n```\n and also I added the following custom CSS to add page breaks to the report: \n```text\n@media\n all\n \n{\n\n\t\n.page-break\n\t\n{\n \ndisplay\n:\n none\n;\n \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n@media\n print\n \n{\n\n\t\n.page-break\n\t\n{\n \ndisplay\n:\n block\n;\n \npage-break-before\n:\n always\n;\n \n}\n\n\n}\n```\n And the following HTML at the bottom of each \"page\" to add the page break: <div class=\"page-break\"></div> If I click the reports tab and use the Adobe PDF printer, I'm able to generate a pdf that is pretty close to what I need for paper copies except that it does not contain the page breaks!!!  And if I try to print it out it also does not contain the page breaks.

I went into the report, and in the Firefox 45 code editor before printing to the Adobe PDF printer installed on my Windows system, I changed the style attribute of the Div surrounding each record to style=\"page-break-after: always; page-break-before: always; width: 100%; hieght=500px\" for one record; then when I print it out the page break for that record works correctly, and only that record is printed on the page. However , if I place this style in the template when I run the report again, each of the records in the report only appear with the width and height attributes, and thus the page-break-* attributes are being filtered out somewhere by the report generator. P.S. I have also tried to use the pagination feature but it only allows me to print one record at a time.",

You then assign a simple amount of needed credit points to a course, event, seminar, etc. and people can use their credits to pay for, and enroll. It's dead simple and common sense. Myself I am looking for days now. But moodle appears to be set up for school like institutions, only, in a form of \"intra-learning\". In this case, the \"student\" would have paid already for attending that school/institution, hence, courses are included. In that way, it's not a true enterprise solution for a global market. Even schools organise \"outside school\" activities , events, workshops, etc., to which a student would need to apply and pay extra. But moodle doesn't seem to have ever thought about that. Am I wrong? Please educate me. I'd be more than happy to learn that I am wrong because that would only mean I can utilise moodle.",

But if so, that would be nice to know so we don't waste such huge amounts of time doing such searches for you! There are many places using Moodle with a paid gateway model, but you are quite right it is not its default model and relies on plugins and adaptations to do that. There are several around, along with the ability to adapt, tweak or even write from scratch, your own authentication/enrolment plugins. You could even use a separate pay-to-play kind of database and then use\nthe built in automatic external database enrolments feature to\nenrol/unenrol users as required (which would be my preferred way to\nachieve what you seem to want). From my knowledge there are also integrations that work with Wordpress and other systems to allow a 'course catalogue' to be advertised and course enrolments to be bought. Moodle tries hard to provide the options it needs within core for its CORE areas. Other requirements are then handled by plugins, developed by users with needs outside the core and often shared with the community, and by the nature of Moodle as Open Source software, allowing you to develop it to match your specific requirements. You may also want to check out the whole area dedicated to business uses of Moodle https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=32 to see if anyone there shares your experiences or can offer advice for you.",

But I see a guest can access that survey and complete it and send it in. It'd be very nice to flag assignments yes or no on allowing a guest to open the link. In fact, it would probably be fine if guests had no access to assignments at all, if that is easier to do.

Using the plugin, the video, due to vimeo permissions, is not displayed correctly on ionic app. By deactivating the plugin, everything works fine. The problem is the referer: using the plugin makes sure that there is a direct call between the moodle app and vimeo. Obviously not recognizing the call referer among those accepted and selected by us in the vimeo privacy settings, it returns a permissions error. How can we solve this issue? Thanks for support.

I cannot see mymodule file under /mod/mymodule/db even tho of course I have created in the online server structure file of Moodle. I tried creating a block and that works and any changes I make there also work fine. However the activity module seems impossible. I have also looked for a video tutorial maybe or something but there is nothing unfortunately. Anyone has the same issue? It would be great if someone could help me out with this.

          "Text": "Hi tanjim, I am not sure what submodule is in your context ; however, if you mean subsections, the same webservices can manage them used in the course editor. I will summarize how they are handled in 4.5. The course in edit mode relies on three webservices to do any editing action: core_courseformat_get_state This webservice returns all the course information about the course structure. It is only a getter so you probably won't need it. core_courseformat_update_course this is the main editing webservice and it can execute a wide range of actions (some of them are common to all formats, other depends on the plugin). The main spec of this webservice is that all actions use the same params: action (string): is a name that identifies which edit action you want to do courseid (int) ids (int[]): an array containing the affected ids. An id may refer to a course module id (used for activities ) or a section id. The interpretation of the id varies based on the action taken. All actions beginning with \"cm\" indicate a course module, which means the id represents activity one, whereas \"section\" pertains to sections . targetsectionid: some actions like moving an element require a final destination id targetcmid: same as targetsectionid but for targeting a destination course module id All actions return what is called a state update, a standardized return value to indicate to the frontend how to alter the state data (the data from core_courseformat_get_state). Some of the current actions are: section: section_move_after section_add / section_delete section_shod /seciton_hide section_state (returns a section state data) course module: cm_show / cm_hide / cm_stealth cm_duplicate / cm_delete cm_move / cm_moveright / cm_moveeleft cm_nogroups / cm_visiblegroups / cm_separategroups cm_state (returns the data of a single activity) core_courseformat_create_module (will be deprecated in 5.2) Subsections are managed mainly as modules (they are activities at a dabatase level). You can use this webservice to create a subsection. Since 4.5, some plugins can be created without the creation form (for now, it is only used in subsection, but in the future, it could be more). This webservice can create those kind of activities. Params: courseid (int) modname (string) targetsectionnum (int): targetcmid (int) IMPORTANT : this webservice will be deprecated in 5.2 and replaced by a new one called core_courseformat_new_module, which will use targetsectionid instead of targetsectionnum (that will be the only change).

There is a way to have Moodle show you every course that has a Lesson in use. Maybe that will help. Go to Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > Manage activities . Scan down the Activity module column. If there is any number other than zero in the Activities column, click on it. You will then see a page listing courses that have a Lesson activity in them.",

The mod.html file I believe is the file that produces the input form for the module to be added. I have a programmer who could work on adapting code to have it work for 1.6. Are you able to provide a sample of the page that produces the input form for creating the map? Alternatively, I have managed to get Google Maps in 1.6 working on its own without your code - just in a side block. What I have not been abel to figure out is how to do the following: - pick up the students locations and convert a city/state/country into a latitude & longitude - pick up the picture of the student and display it on the map Any tips on how to do this - or just a pointer to the bit of code and an explanation of what is happening here would be much appreciated! I know this would be an incredible tool for my students. We have students in 58 countries and it would really help them to feel connected. Thanks, Nikki",

I have looked for a way to do this. As I've found out, Moodle has \"user_filtering\" property in session, it is used in user list, please see user/filters/lib.php. I want to modify this property to add an extra SQL query to filter users. What I need to do now is modifying \"user_filtering\" before admin/user.php is called, this is where user_filtering is initialized and user list is rendered. However, I can't find any plugin type which can do this. I really appreciate if you have any suggestions to achieve this. In the worst case, we will need to hide Moodle's user list from administrators and create our own one.",

          "Text": "Hallo, this is a dev question: I'm trying to add some sum functionality to exercise module grading scheme. I've managed to create and option to use not only average and maximum, in case multiple submissions are made, but also one that makes a sum of the marks given. However, there's a bit of a problem: instead of summing the grades, there is still something (a function or a hardcoded value) that makes an average of the submitted grades. These are the conditions and functions that seemed to be responsible for using the max. score (and it's similar to those for counting an average): In lib.php: if ($exercisemod->usemaximum) {} and the rest (had to be changed to: if ($exercisemod->usemaximum == 1) {} because the option I've added is called is option no. 2, and is written to the db as such) function exercisemod_get_mean_submission_grades($exercisemod) I've modified the loop in order to accept option 2 (elseif ($exercisemod->usemaximum == 2) ... ) and made a function that does exactly what function exercisemod_get_mean_submission_grades($exercisemod) does, but it's called function exercisemod_get_add_submission_grades($exercisemod) and it should sum grades (via the SUM() fuction) instead of counting an average of them. Now the point of the post: even when option no. 2 is selected when setting up the exercise, instead of a sum being made, there's still something that makes an average of the marks. The Question: Does anyone know if there's another function like this one that counts the average? The only one I have found is in locallib.php, however, it doesn't seem it is used anywhere (I couldn't see it being called in any of the other scripts). Pointing me to a php file that uses it would be useful as well.",

          "Text": "It seems that I've somehow misunderstood the conception of Grading strategy. The usemax.html states: Handling of Multiple Submissions This option determines how the exercise should calculate the\nfinal grades of the students. When there are multiple submissions\nthe teacher can chose between either using the best grade or the\nmean grade from each students' set of submissions. This option\ncan be changed at any time during the exercise. Any change has an\nimmediate effect in the Grades page (provided, of course, multiple\nsubmissions are present). I've presumed that this was valid for submissions in case you have more elements in your exercise. However, after translating the moreinfo.html file (the last one), it is now clear that it's only for resubmitted pieces of work that have been reassessed by a teacher. That puts me back to the starting point. So the question now is: Which functions in which file are responsible for calculating the average grade of graded elements when using accumulative grading strategy? I have searched through the source code of the exerice module without any success in finding the piece of code. Moreover, none of the settings in the exercise setup form seem to change this behavior of calculating an average grade of grades of elements to, say, a maximum or something else. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank You for Your time.",

It can now be checked with CLAM anti-virus software. The Exercise module uses that  new mechcanism, thus the reason why it wouldn't install. I'm afraid to use the latest version of exercise you will also have to take the 1.5 dev version of Moodle (something which is not advised if your site is a production site).",

P.S. I am using IIS in Web server .",

          "Text": "I've created a User Tour for the Dashboard page `/my/%` and set the tour filter role to teacher (all other filters are set to \"all\"). When logged in as a teacher, the Dashboard tour does not display and the tour link at the bottom of the page is not present. If the tour filter role is changed to administrator, then the tour does display properly when logged in as an administrator. The Dashboard page is the only page which seems to have this issue. Tours setup for other pages with the filter role set to teacher operate just fine when logged in as a teacher. I'm wondering if this might be a bug with User Tours. Has anybody else experienced this issue? (Running Moodle 3.4+, Build 20171228, User Tours included with Moodle package)",

I suspect it is not a bug but the fact that the dashboard is not dependent on a role, so Moodle doesn't know that a person is a teacher or student when the dashboard page is displayed. You could probably get around it by creating a new custom role (eg Dashboard teacher) and giving that role  in the system context to all your teachers and then setting the tour on the dashboard to display for 'Dashboard' teachers... it depends on how important you feel it is that teachers should have their own user tour different from students.",

I've attached an outline of the changes we've had made to the module to bring it in line with v1.9, highlighting some changes we've made to it to suit our particular use of it. Have a look at the attached document and please provide any feedback in this forum. We're particularly interested in whether the changes we've made are different enough that the community feels this should be a separate module. Many of the changes are around roles/capability-support, and general v1.9 conformance so it shouldn't be a problem hopefully. Please contact me directly if you'd like a copy of the code to test in your own environment. We are currently using the changes on our production Moodle platform but would encourage you to test it locally first. After some testing and approval from the community then I guess If the next step will be for us (or someone with CVS commit access) to add this to the main Contrib CVS repository for the Dialogue module. look FWD to hearing from you,",

The only things I found on the web are this 5 Reasons to use Piwik with Moodle blog post, and this Moodle forum post stating: I have tried \"Intelliboard\", \"piwik\" and some other which are no good. Piwik can't track historical data it only gives you the present and Intelliboard is not free and free version isn't helping. Not enough to make up my mind. Any other hints ? In-depth comparison ?

We will be marking older users as complete for those items in our new system so they may continue where they left off, and we want their Moodle certificates to display the original issue dates they had in the older system. For example, if we were to mark a user complete for our course today (Jan 7, 2025) which unlocks their certificate, we'd like to be able to manually change the issue date to their older completion date. We've explored the mod_coursecertificate and tool_certificate plugins from Moodle Workplace as well as mod_customcert but haven't found such a feature. Can someone recommend a certificate plugin which can do this? Thank you in advance.",

We don't have this problem when loading the same on the desktop. The problem is caused by a particular situation when students are required to scan the QR-code to register their attendance in a class using their phones, after which their phones' browser swiftly goes to other non-Moodle URLs. I've visited multiple websites and forums, but unfortunately couldn't solve this problem. I've examined our index.php file, which seems to be okay. I've also looked at several other config files related to the part responsible for loading on the phone. Please help me. Any hints or recommendations are welcome! Kind regards, Timur",

If you prefer a different date/time format, you can optionally specifyone in the tag. For more information, see the README.md file included with the plugin. Although FilterCodes is available in Moodle.org's plugin repository at https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_filtercodes , please note that this {courseenrolmentdate} tag is new and currently only included in the latest release candidate version available at https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes .

The tiles plugin looks great and it fits in with our design goals but we found out that when we try to pull a Complete report on a participant, the report fails to show what's inside the subsections. I did some testing on a Moodle test server NOT using the Tile plugin and the complete report works as it should, showing the data for the activities within the subsections. So, it seems there may an issue with the tiles plugin and generating the complete report. I have tried to reach out to the developer but this individual looks to be absent from Moodle since December of last year. So I am looking for some guidance/help with the tiles plugin.",

I have checked it from other computers with Iexplorer, Firefox , Windowsd Xp, 7 but with the same result.

So far the only way I can figure out how to do this is to add a projecter to my file but that significantly increases the size and changes it to a .exe file which I would prefer not to do. So how do I set it up so that they can download the actual Flash file if they want to do so?  Am I just missing a setting?  When you right click, I'm only able to Save  Target which is html. I use a 3rd party program called Flair to build my Flash videos.  I use video a lot and prefer it over .wmv because of size and also options.  I can make it interactive.  I'm running Moodle 1.8+ Thanks, LC",

When a user clicks on that it will automatically trigger a download. \"Most of my Flash are just under 16,000 frames, so they are large files for Flash.\" Judging by this, you've embedded the actual frames of the video into the SWF. This increases the overall file size dramatically and can cause problems with the audio-video synchronisation. You'll get a smaller file size and better playback (the video stream will use less bandwidth) if you use the standard FLVPlayback component in the Flash IDE or a ready made FLV player. You can download ready made FLV players for free from various sites. I don't recommend using .exe files as they present a security risk and a lot of firewalls block them automatically.",

          "Text": "Hi Richard, No, what you're asking isn't impossible. The easiest and simplest solution is to treat your published Captivate package as an external resource. Upload the entire folder that Captivate publishes, which should contain a number of SWF files, an HTML web page and a short Javascript file that handles the SWF embedding. Put a link to an external resource on your Moodle course page. There are other ways of doing it but if it's just a \"show and tell\" type presentation without any questions or user feedback, then this technique is perfectly adequate. If you want to keep track of who's watched it, then just put the link to the tutorial on a lesson page. You could also include it in a quiz module with some cloze questions... use your imagination! Please note: If you try to embed the SWF directly in a Moodle page, it most probably won't work because the paths to the other SWFs will be different.",

          "Text": "It appears that NBC Learn has created a plugin to allow students and faculty to embed content from the NBC Universal archives within a moodle course. I believe this is possible without the plugin via copy and paste, but the Moodle plugin obviously places the NBC archive in front of a larger audience. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal_Archives My question is whether or not anyone has implemented the nbclearn plugin and if so, how well has it been received and have concern's over user privacy been addressed? http://nbclearn.com/tools/ From a look at the code it appears that the plugin is mainly an extension for TinyMCE, the built-in text editor. The extension creates an icon within the text editor, that when clicked makes a call to NBC urls to retrieve content. I help run a Moodle instance at a Large North American Public University. And, given that NBC is owned by Comcast,  connecting our most highly utilized web application to this large commercial interest is inherently alarming. A trip through the plugin's code gives me the impression that anyone who clicks on the NBC logo within Moodle's TinyMCE text editor will have his or her Personal Information sent to NBC.",

The LTI plugin for Moodle was developed based on the demand from the hundreds of K-12 and Higher Ed institutions.   We currently offer a similar plugin for Blackboard, Canvas, Desire2Learn, and OLE.    This plugin is free to install and trial for 30 days.   However, only subscribing institutions can unlock the more than 17,000 multimedia resources for teaching and learning. I would be delighted to put you in touch with any of the campuses currently using the Moodle or LTI plugin to share their feedback relative to the functionality and our protection of user information. This video describes the plugin functionality in regards to how faculty can easily embed our resources into Moodle or provide an external tool link for students to access the resources: While the plugin does collect user details, it does so for (2) reasons. A)  To allow a personalized experience including embedding resources into your course and a playlist feature (under development). B)  To provide utilization metrics back to the institution administrators.   We offer monthly usage stats so that the institution can measure utilization and the value of their investment. NBC Learn does not share personal information with any 3rd parties organizations or advertisers.   This information is made clear in the subscription license agreement signed by each institution. We absolutely welcome any feedback regarding the plugin and I would encourage to email me or submit a comment at the footer of our website. Regards, Michael Levin NBC Learn www.nbclearn.com",

I was not able to find privacy  information online or in the plugin's documentation, but thank you for clarifying.  I would have liked to see this information posted up-front, rather than having to investigate the code to find out. Based on the type of information the plugin sends (first name, last name, email address, and course name), it appears to me that an educational institutional installing this plugin would be putting itself in potential violation of FERPA. FERPA: http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html When the NBC logo is clicked from within the text-editor, the plugin does not allow a student to view that his or her educational information will be shared, or allow a student to opt-in or out of sharing. Users of this plugin would have no idea his or her educational information is being shared. You also mentioned the subscription license agreement, is this something that is publicly available online?

These include reasonable security for consumer data, limited\ncollection and retention of such data, and reasonable procedures to\npromote data accuracy; Simplified Choice for Businesses and Consumers -\ncompanies should give consumers the option to decide what information is\nshared about them, and with whom. This should include a Do-Not-Track\nmechanism that would provide a simple, easy way for consumers to control\nthe tracking of their online activities .

At the moment, it works for Word and Excel. what it does is, we can use this Office Skill module to evaluate users' office skills. Moreover, this module is provided the facility to evaluate answers automatically. In other words, this can identify word and excel objects which are created on MS-Office 2007 application package. We have tested this module to evaluate users' skills who have designed in Office Application tool. So, my intention is to add this as an in-built module for the moodle. then users can experience Office Skill module when they download the moodle LMS. How can I add this module the moodle ?

First I will describe my situation and then I will post my questions. So, first off I am trying to create this course as e-learning course for employees of the company to log on and get training. Now I am just picking up where someone else has left off. But originally the course was not going to be like this, but it has manifested into something else. So, because the original person doing this had said Moodle could handle it, everyone now believes it can. Even though though the original creator says he does not think so any more. However was saying something about an application that is coming out that will do this? Problem: I have this Flash presentation I have created and in it it has 20 mins of presentation and then a short quiz. Then another 20 mins of presentation and then another short quiz (so on and so forth). What is wanted from this, is so that the employee logs on and does the whole presentation and all the quizzes, and Moodle stores the quiz results. What I need to know: 1. Can Moodle actually take the quiz scores from Flash and store them?",

If you're being fancy, you want something like a Scorm or IMS package.. there are forums for those. These involve rather complex packages put together outsive of Moodle, but which somehow integrate with Moodle such that your questions get read and stored inside Moodle. I don't know how stable or effective those are. You might find help in forums outside of Moodle where course authors are struggling. One such community might be around the Exe course authoring system which puts files together. Also I've started to look and and have not done much yet with Udutu, which is an online place for building complex packages, and they have provided tools for getting their stand alone flash learning packages a Moodle module for linking tests, etc. You're obviously doing something to get to those 20 minute sound and video and quiz product, so the source might be helpful?

I can't imagine having the skills to produce what you've produced in Flash, so using the free online Udutu tools should be a piece of cake. What's called for there is instructional design moxie in laying out the logic of branching, SCORM isn't that hard to understand, though it seems to take a great deal to get the various dependencies organized. It's primarily, to my mind, a set of procedures for hooking complex things together in reliable ways. The challenge that's being addressed there is how to produce an integrated product in one location (e.g. your computer) such that you can compress it and move it into a course authoring system where all the links to fields for storing scores, running videos, managing sound and text files, etc. will work. I'm sure you can handle it. I'm not sure what kinds of constraints you'll run into. You might need, for instance, to strip the questions out of your flash and put them into their system, along with the flv resources, such that the zipped file you download will link to the Moodle resources that need hooking.

Then on Tuesday, she enters: Clinic Rotation: 1 hour The plug-in would keep a cumulative total and tell her (and the teachers) that she now has a total of three hours.

However this is daunting, since first writing everything in Word and then manually uploading chapters amounts to a terrible loss of time. Is there a way to access the moodle database from *outside moodle* and issue SQL commands to it in order to auto-publish course content? I know enough scripting languages and more in order to pull the course content e.g. from an excel sheet and push it into a database connection, but I would need some starting point where to insert it. Or is it feasible at all to do this? Another way would be Internet Explorer automation, but that seems even more daunting still. Thank you very much for your help - Sincerely, Wolfgang v.

We’ve been using e-learning company Kineo’s 360 appraisal module for Moodle 1.9 ( http://www.kineo.com/moodle/overview-of-360-appraisal-module.html ) for evaluations of our student project over a number of semesters. It’s actually become a critical module for conducting student project reviews. Now we’re upgrading our Moodle software to version 2.2, and we’re very interested in continuing to use this module. We're therefore very interested in having a 2.x version developed, as we haven’t been able to locate one online. I've contacted Kineo, who have no intentions of upgrading the module. And their estimate to develop it is outside our budget. Ideally, the cost could be shared among other interested schools and institutions. Is anyone aware of plans to develop a Moodle 2.x version of the 360 appraisal module? Is anyone interested in having this module upgraded?",

          "Text": "Hi Rudraksh, The information you need can be found in the File API documentation . One of the keys to figuring out how to get the URL of a stored file is to make sure that you stored it correctly in the first place. The Form API documentation on uploading files in forms may help you with that. If you didn't store it correctly, no amount of trying to get the right URL will work for you. Another place to find relevant examples is to look for a plugin in moodle.org/plugins that stores an image file and retrieves it. The plugin doesn't need to particularly do what you are trying to do, just have that little piece code that features the sought functionality. I hope you find this information helpful. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. It would be helpful if you could include a link and point us to relevant sections of the source code. Best regards, Michael Milette",

          "Text": "Page loading times are probably not related to the number of plugins you have installed - for example, even if the 'assign' module was very slow (picking a plugin at random - please don't read anything into that mention), but you didn't ever use it, then it wouldn't be able to slow anything down. Even if you were using it, then the only things it would slow down would be the pages within the 'assign' module itself (e.g. the submission page, the grading pages, etc.), not the course page or any of the other pages on your site (the exception to this would be an activity module that added extra, dynamic information into the course page, such as the number of unread forum posts, but again, this is only a problem if you are using that plugin). In theory, blocks could slow a course page down, but, again, only if a particularly slow block was in use on that page. So to sum up - uninstalling plugins is unlikely to help with performance problems. Certainly don't uninstall any of the core plugins, as they will only reappear when you upgrade to the latest core code.

My cron both inside server and through web failed.  Inside the server i found two corrupt files which when i replaced them worked fine.  but my web cron at  . . . admin/cron.php still fails to work. Here's what the admin at Elluminate just emailed me and I found your post because I'm trying to see what soap errors means. My workaround for now was to have all students use the guest link which works outside moodle. However the teachers can't be moderators this way so i'm asking elluminate to please give teachers access to their moderator links so we can bypass moodle in cases where it's having issues. Right now we are canceling classes right and left due to this problem. BTW , Elluminate is almost done with an update for the moodle elluminate bridge which will work on moodle 1.7 which you may realize will be supported until 2017 - the longest version ever.  That should be smooth sailing for us for a few years so I plan to upgrade both when I can. *** Problem - when the teacher themself cannot get into Elluminate is there a way for them to see their own Moderator link so they can try to get in without going into Moodle in case that is an issue. This concerns me.  If they can execute the SAS direct guest link, that says that SAS is working fine and this is not related to the SAS issues we've been having. I have created and launched a new session and got same issue.  I can launch from guest link but not from the JOIN link.  Logs showed an error message: 2014-09-24 16:54:33 : DEBUG : [sas : Elluminate_WS_SOAPHelper] : SOAP Error: Failed Sending HTTP SOAP request 2014-09-24 16:54:33 : ERROR : [sas : Elluminate_Exception] : Error Code: 0 - Exception: \"Failed Sending HTTP SOAP request\" @ Elluminate_WS_SOAP_Helper-> send_command(); This sounds like your server was unable to issue the command.  I'm checking for more information on this error on my end. I think we might want to turn on Moodle debugging to see if there are errors there as well. That I do know how to do: Site Administration>Development> Debugging",

I have the theme installed and a previous version we were able to restrict it to only display 9 course squares on the home page and basically at the present time I want to do that again and I can't seem to find the setting. Any ideas? Thank you Heather",

So I tried to introduce a little hack into the code of the Glossary module that made it possible. Trying out Moodle 1.6(.1+) I come to the conclusion that I will either have to retain that hack, or throw it into the public space and hope some of the true PHP coders will pick it up and develop further—if other people are interested. What I did was this: in mod/glossary/ sql .php at the very start I inserted // ELFF-mx: start -- determining language for collation $elffcurrlang = ''; $elffcollate = ''; if ($elffcurrlang = current_language()) { switch ($elffcurrlang) { case 'cs_utf': $elffcollate = 'utf8_czech_ci'; break; case 'sv_utf':",

Looks like php's got a problem with admin/index.php file. It happens both with Moodle 2.6 and 2.7 combined with php 5.5 or 5.6. I'm guessing it might be a php configuration problem. This segfault may have something in common with writing capabilities to the database since quite often (but not always!) one of two capabilities provided by the package turns out to be absent in the database when the server \"comes to its senses\" later on. Note: the package does not install any database tables, it uses an external database. Please help me if yoh have any guess or were successful in getting rid of the same problem yourself.",

Essentially, it looks like all has gone well, but when you then try to log in/out, you get redirected to a page saying object moved. if you then manually change your url to go back to the front page , you are taken there to find that you have been logged in/out as you were trying to do. Also, files within moodle stop working and give the same error. Purging all caches doesn't change anything, and on its own, uninstalling the reports and block doesn't But if you uninstall both report and block, and then purge all caches, voila, moodle works correctly again. we are running Moodle 2.6.2+ (Build: 20140508) on a windows 2012 server with PHP 5.6.0. the database is on MSSQL on a seperate server. we have a seperate moodle on a box that is a clone from a few weeks ago that we used to upgrade php on which the problem hasn't occured (both boxes now are on php 5.6 with identical settings) Can anybody shed any light on possible causes?

I already have the rule created and when I edit user's profile fields to pass the rule or create a new user with the profile fields to qualify, wait until cron runs and the users dont get enrolled.

The points I would like to remark are: On the official site, there is no news about a repository for this plugin nor any way of asking/contributing. The Moodle plugins directory for this plugin has outdated details (all of that related to the github). We are willing to ask for new configuration possibilities, and I thought about asking opinion to Dan. Now, I do not know how to proceed. Anyone has contacted or knows how to contribute or ask for new functionalities? By the way, thanks Dan for the big efforts on keeping this plugin.",

They did have some internal developers who expressed an interest in me transferring the github repo to them but they haven't been able to figure it out so I flagged my repo as archived to better reflect the state and transferred ownership of the plugins db entry to a Turnitin developer from their ouriginal team. Turnitin have previously purchased other competitors in the past and shut their services down, migrating clients to their main product. I've also heard from some ouriginal clients that sales teams have been in touch looking to migrate them to use Turnitin. I would advise you contact your ouriginal support contact and ask them what their plans are for ongoing Moodle support. It may not be worth you investing further in if they plan to shut down. I have no visibility or knowledge that suggests they will shut it down or if they have plans for ongoing development, but as you have a contract with them you will likely be able to get an official answer. I'd be interested to hear what you find out!",

Some changes to the ouwiki include; * extensive language file string changes * Add \"New Experiment\" tab to navigation tabs for easily creating new experiment pages. * Changed start page to My ELN Index. * Add ability to \"Clone experiments\" sections into new pages. * Migrated to new events API * Integrated index searching * Added \"Search\" tab to Details page.

It turns out there was a repair needed in the database . Once I did that it was working fine. This time, the database does not appear to need to be repaired. Has this happened to anybody else? Or does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem might be?",

Most of my teachers would see their list of Current Dialogues just fine, but one teacher just got the message \"User's record not found\". I tracked it down to incorrect data in my database. In the mdl_dialogue_conversations table I found an entry with a recipientid and lastrecipientid of 0. Since I don't have a user with an ID of 0 I knew this was wrong. I changed the two fields to the ID of a valid user and the error went away. Note that since I didn't actually know who this dialogue should have been for (since the value was 0), I ended up just finding the dialogue and asking the student to re-enter it. Hope this helps.",

Currently we are trying to, as much as possible, automate mangement of these enviroments. In this process ofcourse comes management of plugins and I am trying to easily access all versions of plugins. It should be apperently but both my short attention spam and google-fu is failing me. :\\ - I have tried to use moosh to list all plugins but, as I do it, I dont get the version of the plugin. The idea is to hold a static file with all plugins and versions that should correspond from dev => qa => prod. Then ansible goes into the enviorment and validates all these versions. if the version is correct it ignores it, but if it is wrong we install it using: moosh plugin-install -d <plugin> <version>, purging cache and so on... f.e. moosh plugin-install -d someplugin 2019100100 This version is stored in the plugins version.php but I find the plugin structure a bit tricky. But are there some other way of obtaining this version number in an easy fashion, preferably from moosh. An alternative is to try to ape after the php script that list them in the WUI or even just parse it out from the version.php files? As we have multiple nodes per enviroment I might not get around synchronizing the entire webdir from one node to all others(but simply making sure to run moosh plugin-install -d someplugin should solve this on all nodes ) Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated. And I am so sorry if the question is stupid. edit: Sorry, quick on the question. I can ofcourse use the database and get mdl_config to get the value where name = 'version' and plugin is the plugin but still. Any other ideas? Cheers'",

          "Text": "I've played with it very briefly. It seems to install fine and I can add an instance of the activity within a course, but the frameset in the activity is empty whether I'm editing or not (Using firefox or IE7). My PHP version is 5.2.1 which is part of the problem (see requirements below - this is an issue). With debugging on I get this: Fatal error : Call to undefined function xslt_create() in ..................../mod/autoview/autoview.php on line 38 From the readme: To install this module into you Moodle server just place the autoview directory into your moodle/mod directory and then point your browser at /admin on your Moodle server. Then copy the language file from the lang directoy into your moodle lang directory. This module also requires the following extras which may not be part of the default PHP installation on your system 1) XSLT support. This is an option on PHP 4 and it should be installed. XSLT asppears to be a standard function in PHP5 but the api seems to have  changed, so the module may not work on PHP5 at present. (my emphasis) 2) pecl_http extension is needed for the link to the online document converter to work. This extension can be obtained from http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http/ Support ------- Feel free to visit and log on to the AutoView forums on http://autoview.autotrain.org Known Problems -------------- 1) The AutoView 3 client is heavily tested in Mozilla Firefox, IE and Opera and should be reliable and bug free. The editor code is still pre-release and has only had proper testing in using Mozilla Firefox. Use of the editor in Internet Explorer is known to be broken and should not be attempted. 2) You need to make sure that the data directory for the course has been created before trying to create an instance of the module in that course, otherwise the module will fail. 3) Unless you are feeling very brave, stick to using the Macromedia Flash slide format. Image slide formats require the files to have been processed in a particular way and this has not yet been documented",

Users don't automatically get a value for each custom field when the custom field is created, so it is entirely possible that the value in $id will be 'false' (because there is no existing record), which won't work when you try to call $DB->update_record(). You need to handle the case of $id being false, by preparing the required data and calling $DB->insert_record() instead.

So, assuming you have defined a field with the 'short name' value of 'myfield', then you can write: $fieldid = $DB->get_field('user_info_field', 'id', ['shortname' => 'myfield']); You can then use that $fieldid value in your later queries to get the correct record from table 'user_info_data' (or you can create a slightly more complex SQL query that gets both bits of data at the same time). You could use 'record_exists()', but if that returned true, then you'd need to do another query to get the id of the record (and extra DB queries add an overhead that you don't want). Far better to still do your original $DB->get_field_select() query, then, if that returns false (which it will do, if the record is not found), do the insert.

          "Text": "I just installed the scheduler module. I had a couple questions/suggestions about it. It is a bit peculiar that the teacher's short profile appears at the top of the page. I presume this is probably there because the student is being reminded they are making an appointment with the teacher but since the teacher might want to use the scheduler for some other purpose and because the student should already know who the teacher is this seems a bit obnoxious. The reminder and invitation use external email programs. If the teacher does not use an external email program, these functions are useless. It would be better if the email was sent directly from Moodle The reminder and invitation should have customizable texts, and not just through the language pack, as a teacher might want to send a different message for different appointments. A nice addition would be a note field for the student when they make their appointment. This could be used for the student to include the topic they wish to discuss or somesuch. For me, I would like to use this module to schedule online voice chats with students, and I would like them to be able to tell me which voice chat software they will be using and/or their username in advance so that I can \"meet\" them in the proper place, rather than require they use a specific program because I don't know what they are using. It would be nice if the module would email the teacher to tell them when a student had made an appointment so they don't have to keep checking to see if slots are filled.",

Since I previously announced the feature on the Moodle forums, I have made a number of improvements: Marginalia now supports Internet Explorer in addition to Firefox users can view each others' highlights and annotations directly on forum pages, not just in the searchable summary the search capability has been enhanced numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and better documentation support for Moodle 1.6 The system is currently in use at Malaspina University College and Simon Fraser University in BC, Canada.

          "Text": "I missed this at the time, but it's worth answering. The short answer is \"no\". Most Moodle plug-ins are units of functionality independent of each other. Marginalia, however, adds functionality to an existing plug in: it adds an annotation margin and other UI elements to the forum module. This is something Moodle doesn't anticipate, so there's no simple way to do it. Marginalia therefore has to directly modify the forum code with a patch. The longer answer is that although there is no way around patching the forum, I have just released a version of Marginalia that is easier to install. It uses the hooks Moodle provides to automatically set up the database , and it consolidates its language files into a block plug-in. The latest release has numerous bug fixes and UI refinements. It also features a quote button that makes it easy to quote passages from forum posts (highlight a passage and hit quote: it will automatically paste the quote into any post you might be editing, or start a new post if necessary). The quote feature can also be used to effectively convert annotations to forum posts. Users had been trying to conduct discussions in the margin, which was rather impractical, especially since discussion is what the forum itself is for. You can get the latest at code.google.com/p/marginalia .",

Studends usually know their teachers but not the exact name of each course, wich changes every year and is generally not easy to remember. AFAIK the standard course search box searches within course name, short name and description. Is it possible to search courses by teacher? My workaround is the QuickFind plugin since the profile page of each teacher has that teachers's course list. Of course it would be much better a plugin giving directly a course list as a result. A SQL query for such a search is easy but I've zero knowledge of Moodle APIs. Any clue? In alternative, could a block such as QuickFind be placed at the bottom of the home page together with the standard course search box?",

While the students can assess (and their marks end up in the correct columns in the overview sheet), my assessments end up in the students section as well. My comments show up there (which I could live with by flagging them as mine) but worse, my evaluations also are summarized into the students column (at least that is what is assume, as they don't show up under the teacher assessment column). I assume some kind of role conflict, but can't figure out where that might come from.

The applications are great, but I was thinking, it would be wonderful for my school if I could use one of these apps for the students to study and then the techers use them to test the students.  The apps have tousands of vocabulary words, their definations and word usage, and there is an audio feature, so the words are pronounced for the student, then he/she spells them out and the app then grades them. I want to removed as must manual grading from my teachers are possible.  This would be an awesome feature and would endure this application to more elementary, middle and high schools.",

I would like to do something like what Druple does, where you have the blocks, header, and then the article title. This would exist in the center section not as a sideblock. The thought was to run multiple newsfeeds on the page. Any suggestions on the best (and easiest) way to do this? Thanks Mike",

          "Text": "Hi, This is my first time to use Virtual Programming Lab (VPL) module. I create the assignment easily, and student submit. I can see their submission list, and see individual files showing the file size. They can also view up to this point. Neither me (the admin) nor the students can download and we get this error message: Warning : require_once(/home/manalorama/moodle.manalhelal.com/mod/vpl/views/../similarity/watermark.php) [ function.require-once ]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/manalorama/moodle.manalhelal.com/mod/vpl/views/downloadsubmission.php on line 10 Fatal error : require_once() [ function.require ]: Failed opening required '/home/manalorama/moodle.manalhelal.com/mod/vpl/views/../similarity/watermark.php' (include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php:/usr/local/php5/lib/ pear ') in /home/manalorama/moodle.manalhelal.com/mod/vpl/views/downloadsubmission.php on line 10 When I open the downloadsubmission.php file the problematic lines are : require_once dirname ( __FILE__ ) .

'/../vpl_submission.class.php' ; The only missing file is /../similarity/watermark.php When I remove this line, other files cause the same problem although they are located in the specified location I don't know why the installation of VPL missed this file, and how to fix this error. I hope there is something to fix the error soon to be able to grade the assignment. Otherwise, is there a way to convert a VPL assignment to normal moodle assignment to keep student submission as is. Thank you very much for your help in advance,",

The solution is easy: reinstall the vpl module. Reinstalling step by step manually: Please let us know if this solves the problem. In any case, I think you should find out what happened so it does not repeat. Best regards Juan Carlos Rodríguez",
