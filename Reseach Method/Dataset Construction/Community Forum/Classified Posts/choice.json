I can use the Choice function to let them sign up for times and limit how many can sign up for a single day so we spread people out. However, I'd like to have an option for them to then answer a short response with the topic of their presentation so I (and the class) can see what topics will be presented each day. Is there any way to add a second question to the Choice activity, or include a \"comment\" on the choice selected where students could input their topic? Alternatively, are there any question types available in the Feedback or Quiz modules that would accomplish the same function as the Choice? I could build the short answer question into a Feedback activity, but I couldn't find any option for a \"signup\" type question where the number of responses to each choice is limited. I could, of course, use two different modules for the two different questions, but that is awkward and likely to get poor response from students.\nLabel: ",

I couldn't find this on the forum so I apologize if it has already been addressed. I successfully created a \"Choice\" activity for one of my classes but I would like it to be shared between two of them (I want the total number of answers for a given option to be added between students of two different classes, since they are deciding on the issue together). Is it possible to do such a thing on Moodle? Thank you!\nLabel: ",

Trying to implement a guided route\non the educational material for my students using restricted access, I\nrealized that something is missing from Moodle. There is no way to\nrestrict access based on a choice activity. (*see note below) The restrictions that can be imposed on content are based on the following factors: activity completion date grades group grouping profile I strongly believe that adding the extra factor of \"choice\" on\nthe restrictions would help greatly and I believe that it shouldn't be\ntechnically difficult to do so. What do you think? This feature has been mentioned multiple times in earlier discussions: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=226273 (I agree with Mary and I have used this method, but this is different) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=221923 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=335529 Thanks in advance! (*) Note: There is a complicated way to do something similar, but not exactly this. By using the group choice plugin and the restriction\nby group, we can partially achieve this, but it requires an extra\nplugin and makes the restriction global for the whole course, not just\nfor the part that is needed. Added to this, in case where groups are\nneeded for other use, this workaround is not suitable.\nLabel: ",

Despite checking and testing the permissions for authenticated users etc. I still wasn't able to submit a choice without enrolment. We use choices almost like sign-ups, presenting time slots of availability. Some of our central workshops would like to use the Choice activity to allow students to book into their resources, without the need to be enrolled into their 'pages' (courses) - Wouldn't want student  dashboards to be full of 'upcoming' events. Appreciate that the end date could be removed, but it is useful. From a few historic posts, it suggests that Choice activities cannot be complete by unenrolled users by design, post Moodle 2.0 - Can anyone shed any light? If there are any alternatives in the standard Moodle activities that you can recommend instead, I'm more than happy to take a look. Many thanks as always, Anthony\nLabel: ",

I've proposed a patch on that issue ( MDL-50292 ) that would add a \" mod/choice:viewpublishedresults\" permission to the choice activity to allow us to control which users are actually allowed to see the results. I'm hoping to get some feedback from other moodlers on whether this is a good idea. Thanks!\nLabel: ",

Currently, completion tracking does not distinguish between choices made. Such a change outlined above would also potentially require ability for a user to change their selection from \"stop\" to \"continue\" option. Dan, do you think such a change is practical in the wider Choice module, or should we look at a local customisation? Can you estimate the amount of work required to make such changes? Others here, do you have an alternative method (preferably that's not using the quiz module, since it's rather a clunky solution to the problem) for acting as a \"gatekeeper\" on a user's progress in the course?\nLabel: ",

I want to automate this completely, so I want to associate each question and option with an area of grammar so that when the students' responses are tabulated in the database , that I can then generate reports from. For an individual student I would like a report that shows the grammar areas that were passed and those that were failed. For a whole class I  would like to see the general trends with percentage breakdowns. Once I have this in place, a future development would be to then link the failed areas from the assessment to a customized set of online lessons and activities to address an individual student's weak areas. So is this level of customization easily do-able in Moodle? I'm  trying to decide now whether to try to use Moodle to make this, or to build it myself from scratch. Thanks for any advice...!\nLabel: ",

Also i have another query once all my wonderful students have made their choice is their a simple way to create groups from the choice results.  Third and finally can students within a group be contacted without the information being broadcasted to those that are enrolled in the course. Our uni site has some courses running soon about this but they will be too late for the start of the session. Thanks Claire\nLabel: ",

If I understand correctly, the limit setting for each option allows me to cap how many people sign up for each date. I need that. I need also to be able to block certain students from signing up, and that is clearly not supported. Is something coming up in the enhanced module preannounced in summer? I thought to make an exclusion list using the interface like assigning students to groups. However, this would require modifying the database , so ain't so trivial. I wonder whether in the interim I could whack it using groups. I'd have to be able to block one group from participating. Another alternative is for me to clone the choice into a new module. This would free me from worrying about backwards compatibility. The catch is that I need it before Xmas.\nLabel: ",

I have been playing around with using the quiz module for this, where we'd create a \"quiz\" each week that consisted of a single question with the ability to select several answer choices (each event they want to participate in) or a \"quiz\" where each event has a \"yes I want to attend this\" or \"No thank you\" response.  Then the student's name and their \"quiz\" results would be sent to the Residential Director who could create the list of those actually attending. The things that I think are missing though is a time-stamp so activities can be filled on a first-come-first-served basis with overflow going on a waiting list, or a way to set a limit to the number that can sign up for a particular event.  It would also be wonderful if we could have the Residential Director get a list of who selected which choices, in time order, but that's probably asking a bit much from a quiz module. Thomas Robb suggested that I take a look at the choice module, but the messages I've seen indicate that choices are limited to six options, which rather puts a crimp on how we can do the sign-ups when we run 20 to 25 activities each weekend.  We could seperate out in batches of 6 activities, but I'd rather just have a field of check boxes that the students can click on the activities they want to sign up for. Now, I haven't tried playing around with choice yet to make it fit, but can I get the outputs sorted by choice and time-stamp order?  That is, everyone who selected \"Grocery Trip, Fri, 3:15-4:15\" in the order that they submitted their request so that we can just fill up the vans and the rest are put on a waiting list when the van capacity is full? Also, is it possible to select more than one choice per question?  Sorry, I know I should probably try playing around with this myself, but I haven't had the time to get to it yet, and if these aren't possible, I'll keep trying to play with the quiz module.\nLabel: ",

I've just discovered your very cool program and am extremely excited about adding it to my site! However, it looks like my usage will be a bit difference than most of your other examples. I run a website for a large, worldwide historical re-creation group called the Society for Creative Anachronism (\"SCA\") which researches and recreates the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. I will be using Moodle to allow various people in the SCA to offer classes on subjects they have researched.  As such, I don't have a pre-set, 100% reliable teacher base. Consequently, I'd love to be able to have the students rate the teachers after the class re: skill, knowledge, responsiveness, etc. so that I can weed out the not so good ones. Is there any function for something like this? Or any chance of one in a future version? Regardless, this looks like an awesome program and I'm thrilled to have found it! Thanks!\nLabel: ",

I can use the Choice function to let them sign up for times and limit how many can sign up for a single day so we spread people out. However, I'd like to have an option for them to then answer a short response with the topic of their presentation so I (and the class) can see what topics will be presented each day. Is there any way to add a second question to the Choice activity, or include a \"comment\" on the choice selected where students could input their topic? Alternatively, are there any question types available in the Feedback or Quiz modules that would accomplish the same function as the Choice? I could build the short answer question into a Feedback activity, but I couldn't find any option for a \"signup\" type question where the number of responses to each choice is limited. I could, of course, use two different modules for the two different questions, but that is awkward and likely to get poor response from students.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: The Scheduler (cf. https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_scheduler ) plugin might suit your need in this case.\nLabel: ",

Trying to implement a guided route\non the educational material for my students using restricted access, I\nrealized that something is missing from Moodle. There is no way to\nrestrict access based on a choice activity. (*see note below) The restrictions that can be imposed on content are based on the following factors: activity completion date grades group grouping profile I strongly believe that adding the extra factor of \"choice\" on\nthe restrictions would help greatly and I believe that it shouldn't be\ntechnically difficult to do so. What do you think? This feature has been mentioned multiple times in earlier discussions: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=226273 (I agree with Mary and I have used this method, but this is different) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=221923 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=335529 Thanks in advance! (*) Note: There is a complicated way to do something similar, but not exactly this. By using the group choice plugin and the restriction\nby group, we can partially achieve this, but it requires an extra\nplugin and makes the restriction global for the whole course, not just\nfor the part that is needed. Added to this, in case where groups are\nneeded for other use, this workaround is not suitable.\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

We use choices almost like sign-ups, presenting time slots of availability. Some of our central workshops would like to use the Choice activity to allow students to book into their resources, without the need to be enrolled into their 'pages' (courses) - Wouldn't want student  dashboards to be full of 'upcoming' events. Appreciate that the end date could be removed, but it is useful. From a few historic posts, it suggests that Choice activities cannot be complete by unenrolled users by design, post Moodle 2.0 - Can anyone shed any light? If there are any alternatives in the standard Moodle activities that you can recommend instead, I'm more than happy to take a look.

Currently, completion tracking does not distinguish between choices made. Such a change outlined above would also potentially require ability for a user to change their selection from \"stop\" to \"continue\" option. Dan, do you think such a change is practical in the wider Choice module, or should we look at a local customisation? Can you estimate the amount of work required to make such changes?

If we deactivate the max-limit for the options , the choice-activity works fine. Does anyone knows the issue?

Here is the string: Settings>>grade administration>>categories and items>>full view From here you can manually add a grade item, and by creating a scale/grade or text, you can manually input the results of the choice.

It is currently not possible to restrict activities based on a particular choice selection but if you offer them only one, it should work. So if they don't agree, they don't click \" I agree\" and they don't get to do the rest of the course.\nComment 6: Is this agreement applicable to a specific Moodle course only or to using the entire Moodle on your site? If it is the latter, you could use the site policy functionality, which does exactly what you want except that applies to using the entire Moodle (it pops up during login and does not let users continue if they do not agree).\nLabel: ",

But that Activity showing on homepage for both anonymous as well those users roles which I have not assign.

Normally, role restricting could be done at the activity-level in the permissions. The Choice module, however, does not have a specific \"view\" permission, therefore, one cannot turn it on/off per role (other than hiding it or grouping it).  I haven't tried this yet, but it is possible to make groups on the front page , then as suggested, you could group the choice module. I agree, despite the fact that guests don't have access to making the choice, I only want authenticated users to see this activity at all.\nLabel: ",

I am seeking some assistance. My institution recently upgraded to Moodle 2.4. We are noticing however that when choice activities have been created, even if an instructor limits a particular option to accommodate 5 responses, more than 5 individuals are able to select that option. This causes confusion for the department staff as well as the students. Is anyone else experiencing this same issue and if so what recommendations could you kindly suggest to resolve this issue? Regards, Kirk Wilson\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: The most common cause of this is described in MDL-12083 - it relates to users being un-enrolled in a course removing the selected option allowing others to take their place but then re-enrolling in the course and having their choice restored. there are a couple of other bugs in the tracker that might be related as well.\nComment 2: Hi Dan. Thanks much for your quick feedback. I really appreciate it. My issue seems to be slightly different as we have observed it in courses where students were not unenrolled. Up to last week I created a new choice activity in a test course and had fellow staff members enrol themselves in the course and participate in the choice. No one was removed either by themselves or by me. Yet, it was still observed that persons were able to over-register for particular sessions. So right now I have five (5) persons registered for an option that was limited to take three (3) responses alone. Any further assistance would be welcome. Regards, Kirk Wilson\nComment 3: Hi Maybe you should check group(s) settings. Is it the activity group based? Regards\nComment 4: We're getting reports from lecturers of the exact same problem (also on 2.4), and again unenrolments are not involved. One lecturer found that 7 people had been able to choose an option that was limited to two.\nComment 5: Hi Bart, Are you using groups for that course or activity? Thanks\nComment 6: Hi Bart, were you able to get this sorted? Did it have anything to do with groups? I have a similar issue reported with a course on our 2.4 system. I'm trying to reproduce the issue with no luck so far. Any help would be appreciated. You can email me direct if that works better. steve_gormley@carleton.ca\nLabel: ",

There were a variety of limits for the different sections , but in some cases the number of students exceeded the set limt. For example, I set a 20 person limit for the Monday 2nd period section, but 29 were able to select that section. This only happened to 3 other sections and they were ones with higher limits. I don't know if this had anything to do with it, but the server was hit pretty hard. When the activity opened there about 300 users trying to make selections and the server really slowed down. A couple of students also got database errors.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Did you really  set a 20 person limit? please send me the screen shots so that i can help you\nComment 2: problem will be due to groups. seems it allows limits set for each group.\nLabel: ",

(Overbooked? Inconvenient location? Inconvenient time?) Is there a way to do this? I thought Choice would work, but even after changing the Permissions for both the Activity and the Course to include Guests and being able to make a choice-- I still get an error message that I must be enrolled to make a choice. I tried Feedback with the same result. I put it on the first page and got the message that I needed to be logged in. Liz\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I must be missing your point somehow. How does Moodle know who is answering the choice when user is not logged in? If everybody answers choice as a guest, you would have a single answer regardless how many people answered. If you really need anonymous answers from multiple users, use the feedback module.\nComment 2: I tried this with the feedback module first! Even though there is guest access to the course, and the feedback was set to be anonymous, guests don't have the opportunity to answer a question. I added a sample feedback question here: http://wstraining.org/moodle/course/view.php?id=5\nComment 3: Choice won't work for non-logged in users; Feedback WILL work but only if you put it on the front page of your Moodle and not in a course -see number 1 here http://docs.moodle.org/en/Feedback_FAQ\nComment 4: Thank you. Is there any way to do what I propose? Since the reason I'm asking why the person can't take the session is because they can't take the session, I'd like them not to have to enroll in the class in order to tell me why.\nComment 5: Well a simple workaround would be to make a form in Google forms and then link to it from your guest access course.\nComment 6: Thank you. I'll look for a non-Moodle solution.\nLabel: ",

If I change roles to view the page as a \"student\", so that the voting displays anonymously, my CHOICE activity requires me to vote as the \"student\" before seeing the results...thereby skewing the actual voting by 1 vote! So....my question is: How, as the teacher, can I display the final voting results to my class for discussion....without also displaying the names of each student publicly? PS - I realize I could log in as one of the students in my classroom....but is there any other way?  Surely there must be! Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Mr Murray, After a little experimentation, I found that in my case (Moodle 2.3), I can do this in two ways: (1) Under Publish Results, I choose \"Always show results to students\" (2) I restrict answering to a certain time period and, under publish results, I choose \"Show results to students only after the choice is closed\". In both cases, when I look at the Choice activity as a teacher, I can see a bar graph with the response count but without the names. The names appear only if I click on \"View responses\". These workarounds are not perfect if one uses Moodle as an alternative to clickers in that with (1) students may be influenced by the choices of classmates who vote before them (visible on their mobile devices) and with (2) it may be cumbersome to set up the right time to end the activity, especially if multiple activities are used in succession. Ideally, one would want the teacher to be able to see the graph even when the students cannot. If, however, the teacher asks the students to vote before the class and only wants to display the results in class, (2) seems fine. Best regards, Sergio Mazzarelli\nComment 2: These workarounds are not perfect if one uses Moodle as an alternative to clickers.. Have you tried the Realtime Quiz plugin ( http://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_realtimequiz )? It basically replicates the features of a clicker in Moodle.  It will allow students to see the results of voting on questions that you set up in advance.\nLabel: ",

It might be worth checking with your admin that students haven't been assigned the role sitewide via Site admin >Assign system roles -this would put them in your course as well as everywhere else. Alternatively the default role in User policies (another site admin setting) might be \"student\" which would also do the same.\nComment 3: I did not figure this out and I do know that only my class is assigned student roles as I added them myself, but I appreciate your answer. I did find that when I divided the students into groups that I could view one group at a time without the whole school showing up so I did get around it.  But I am having the same problem with some of the other activities such as quiz and journal where everyone shows up and I would like to find a solution to avoid this.

I want to automate this completely, so I want to associate each question and option with an area of grammar so that when the students' responses are tabulated in the database , that I can then generate reports from. For an individual student I would like a report that shows the grammar areas that were passed and those that were failed. For a whole class I  would like to see the general trends with percentage breakdowns. Once I have this in place, a future development would be to then link the failed areas from the assessment to a customized set of online lessons and activities to address an individual student's weak areas. So is this level of customization easily do-able in Moodle? I'm  trying to decide now whether to try to use Moodle to make this, or to build it myself from scratch. Thanks for any advice...!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I think this is in the wrong forum as you can't really do this with the Choice module. You can get an automated Quiz (using the Quiz module) of multiple choice questions and get a report out of it later that shows you who answered which question correctly, which questions were mostly answered best and worst overall etc. Not sure about the future development part, where it would then automatically create a set of customised lessons.\nLabel: ",

I'd prefer it used it's own new capability instead of relying on the choice/delete capability. you will need to be careful with the limits and groups code to make sure it works with that. I'd also like to see the option to allow a teacher to make those selections even if the show unanswered column isn't shown. at the moment - a teacher can make a choice for a student if they have the \"login as\" capability, but that takes a lot more clicking around and is a much bigger capability, so I can see how adding this could be useful for some people! I don't have any \"standard tests\" documented, but it's something I should do at some point - it would be good to put some unit tests in place too! when you make your patch, it would be good if you could add it to a tracker issue in the Moodle Tracker (and link to the bug here!)

This button was called \" creatgroups \". In Moodle 1.9.13 the button seems to be gone. Too bad. It was a cool feature, being able to have users sign up for a group in the choice module and then automatically creating groups based on those results. Anyone know of an alternative? Thanks\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Gus. I think your button might have been coming from a non-standard module as there isn't normally a creategroups option within the choice. Have you had any extra plugins added to your Moodle?\nComment 2: Hi Mary, unfortunately I cannot remember where I read it, but I also thought that it would be possible for me to create groups and groupings exploiting the Choice tool: I thought it might be as simple as to ask students to sign up (i.e. choose) one of several groups (for class presentations in my case), and then I thought there would be some way of saving these data and then importing them back as separate groups. Can this be done? Many thanks! EDIT: I am on Moodle 2.1\nComment 3: not using the choice module - I vaguely recall writing a choice module group self selection patch back in 1.5 but we decided it was better suited outside the choice mod - do a search for 2.0 group self selection - I'm pretty sure I saw something here in the forums about some code for 2.0\nComment 4: thanks, will check it out (I did see the message you are referring to, but I thought it would not work for 2.1)\nComment 5: We've started using the group self-selection module to allow users to add themselves to groups: http://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_groupselect Hope it helps.

I have the same question. Simon\nComment 2: Hi Andrew, I'm looking for something very similar myself, though I can confirm that this is not currently possible without installing a third-party tool or applying a patch to core code. I've been asked to find a way to allow students to select up to five from several (135) available projects. Each project can allow only five students to select it. Once all selections have been made the teacher will export the selections and use an algorithm someone else has provided to allocate one project to each student from their choices. So far I've worked out that I can restrict the number of students choosing a project using a Choice activity, but not allow more than one selection per choice. The Questionnaire/Feedback tool has the opposite problem; students can select up to 5 but the number of project selections can't be limited. Does anyone know of a way to do this? I'm open to third-party tools but would prefer to avoid patches to core code. Any help would be much appreciated.\nComment 3: There used to be a module for signing up for exams, which would do pretty much what you need. It allowed a group of students to choose an exam date from several available (projects in your case) with each date having a set limit for the number of students. It even had a waiting queue feature, if I recall. It ensured that a student selected only a single date. So, in your case, you could have set up 5 identical instances for students to select their projects. I don't think that module is supported anymore but I haven't looked at it for quite a while. It could be a good base to make your own custom module if needed.\nLabel: ",

Would someone kindly give me the flow tree to where I set the top menu (like \"About/News/Support\" and such)? Also, how I set (place and link) big icons like are on the home page of moodle.org. I'm a Joomla! user so I'm looking for the short version! Joomla! has a menus section for creating them. Everything seems to be written for the Moodle course level. My guess is that I'll make the artwork, place it on a certain page and link it somehow!!!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: What version of Moodle are you using? 1.9 or 2.0? With either, if you set the front page settings to \"include a topic section\" then when you turn on th editing on the front page you get a block you can edit where you can insert images and then you can hyperlink those images to courses/categories as you wish. Moodle.org has its own custom theme but if you have Moodle 2.0 then you can have tabs at the top by going to site admin>appearance>themes>theme settings and scroll down you get \"custom menu items\" where you can make your own menus.\nComment 2: Having your own custom theme would explain...why I can't find it!!! I'm new at Moodle so I went with the new 2.0 as there is no reason to learn the old and then upgrade. I know this way may have less info but at least I'll be on the front side as it developments!!! I've found them and it's time to start playing! Moodle is SOOO close in many ways to Joomla! but at the same time SOOO different!!! I actually make my own templates for Joomla! so I know where everything is and where stuff goes! Glad to see you hanging out. Ain't it O'dark thirty where you are???\nComment 3: Hi Dan, As Mary has said, the large icon type images are simply that, images in the topic section of a page with hyperlinks. Having seen it here first, I used it for my original primary school website as the children (and some of the staff!) prefered it to navigating menus. The custom menu option for Moodle 2 is a really useful tool to create menus without needing to go into the theme files themselves as you needed to do in Moodle1.9. It can be difficult to style, but if you find a theme you like as a starting point and explore how the menu is styled there, and then look at a few others, you can eventually find your way around it. The other thing with the Moodle2 custom menu is once you do get some experience playing round with the Moodle Themes , you can look at overriding the renderer to do all sorts of things with it. Maybe one step at a time, but keep on going - the moodle learning curve gets you there and with the support of the 2 Marys and others on these forums, everything is achievable!!! Rich\nLabel: ",

In Moodle 2.0 e.g. Moodle 2.0.2+ (20110223) when a student makes a Choice (choice activity) the next screen opens in a new window which can lead to problems and confusion. For example the user can change their choice on the previous original screen even if \"allow choice to be updated\" = \"No\" I can not see any additional settings for the choice activity to control this behaviour. Has anyone else experienced this problem? In Moodle 1.9 the next screen for Choice was never in a new window so I can only assume this an error somewhere.

Voters were only allowed to select one for each office (Pres./VP, Secretary and Treasurer). I had a new class created called \"Freshman Elections,\" and the students had to register for the course with a key given them by their social studies teachers. A day before the election I changed the key to lockout further changes. We learned that although 300+ users can login to Moodle at the same time, they could not all write to the database at the same time. We left the election open over night. Let me know if you have further questions.\nComment 2: Michael,  This is exactly what we would like to do for our Student Union Elections but I do not undertsand your solution fully.  Please can you elaborate. Do you mean that I should create an 'election' course and then use the choice activity to enable students to vote?  I haven't used choice before so I shall go and read up on this right now. Our main concern is to allow easy access but limit students to just one vote per position. Regards lesley\nComment 3: Hi Lesley. Yes, that's what I'd do - in fact what we have done - when having 'elections' Choice lends itself very well to this sort of thing and you can set it so they can only vote once and they can only vote for one person. You can set a time limit for voting too - ie , 24 hour period for example.\nComment 4: Do you know is there a way to do voting when you want more than one choice.  Another words they can vote for 4 people.\nLabel: ",

When I vote again, it just changes the users vote, but doesn't add to the tally. Anyone know how to make it so a user can vote more than once?\nComment 2: To collect multiple votes, you need multiple voting activities . Normally, each user has a single vote (choice), so voting again is expected to change the previous vote. You can rig multiple-choice solution using the database module me thinks.\nComment 3: What do you mean by \"multiple voting activities\"?\nComment 4: Hi Will, For each user's choice to be recorded individually they have to be each logged in with their own account. If you think about it, it can't be any other way. Moodle has no way of distinguishing between users if they all use the same \"generic\" account. Cheers, Glenys\nComment 5: Try Feedback: Anonymous choices and multiple entries SHOULD allow users (and a shared ID) to enter more than once, and record each occasion. However, the fly in the ointment is that the user that re-enters (or the second person using the shared ID) sees a message saying 'you have already completed this feedback' - but IS then allowed to make another entry.\nComment 6: If you want to get two separate votes, you need to set up two separate choice instances. If you want to allow making more than one choice within a single instance of activity, try the database module, as I said earlier. It has an option to allow multiple records per participant. Using a common userid for multiple people will still be problematic.\nLabel: ",

A Choice activity allows a Student to make a single choice from a range of options. (This is like voting for something). However, the Teacher can setup a Choice activity so that a Student can change their mind, and change their selection . So the Student can transfer their vote to a different option. Perhaps this is what is meant by 'single transferable vote' ?\nLabel: ",

So I used the choices tool and allocated students into choices eg/ monday 11-1, tuesday 9-11, etc. The important bit is to be able to get the listing of students from the choices and convert to a group.

The students shall be able to check who is already in which group, to select their group and to change the group (before a deadline) if they want. So the choice module seems ideal. My problem: how can I easily transfer the choise \"results\" to working groups in the course? Vera\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Vera, I looked at adding this as a feature to the choice here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=24656 be careful with this patch though as I haven't tested it, and the choice module has gone through quite a few changes since! it was decided that the Choice module was the wrong place for this, that it should be included in the groups management. there's a patch somewhere in this fourm that adds it to the group end -\nnot sure what version, or whether it works still - make sure you test\nthese patches in a non-production environment as they may break\nsomething. http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=6247 Also - if you were able to arrange funding for this development, you\ncould contact moodle.com or one of the Moodle Partners and they may be\nable to develop something for you that works!\nComment 2: I would like to get groups made directly from choices. Is this possible. For example, students select labs based on choices, and these choices automatically become lab groupings.\nComment 3: Hi There, please avoid cross-posting - especially in the same forum! the latest version of a group self-selection patch is available via: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-1273 it isn't something that will be added to the choice module. thanks,\nLabel: ",

The choice is not designed to have a grade assigned.\nComment 2: Margaret - The feedback module will be included in 2.0. I don't believe it currently has any grading functionality built in to it but you could create a feature request in the Moodle Tracker . Also, you could request that the choice have an option for grading based on completion. Practically speaking, Dan's suggestion is a good one to just use a single question quiz. I've seen this done when a teacher is first starting with Moodle and wants to ensure that the students can take a quiz and then give them credit for doing so. Let us know what works best for you.

The same thing happens if the teacher chooses to \"display a directory\". Can anyone suggest a solution to the problem?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: If it's only happening for that one teacher then that would suggest that there is something up at their end (perhaps with their PC or network profile), rather than there being a problem with your Moodle installation. Does the same problem occur with other users?\nComment 2: This happens for all teachers. They can set up the form for a Choice activity.  However, when they click on the Save changes button the program aborts with a 404 \"File Not Found\" error. We are running Moodle on a Windows Server 2003 box; MySQL 5; PHP 5; IIS 6 and Moodle 1.5.4+.\nComment 3: Sounds like you could be missing some of the Moodle files, which is strange. That, or your permissions for some files are such that the server can't read them. Personally, I'd back up your current system (do a database dump and copy application files elsewhere) and upgrade to a newer version.\nLabel: ",

I’ve created a “choice” on the main page and here is what I’ve found: Students by default cannot take the choice. I had to use the “roles” option to assign all users as students so they could take the choice. If I use site settings and change “Default role for all users defaultuserroleid /label>” to students then their “Overview of my courses” shows ALL available course and not just the ones enrolled in. As site admin when I view the responses I only see mine even though it says I have more than one response. Any ideas? Thanks Jeff\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Here is what I have found. In order to see the results of the choice I have to use roles from the site admin user group and assign students as students. It would seem that during the migration students are not considered students anymore. Jeff\nLabel: ",

\nComment 1: copy of my reply to your report: bug 5056 it looks like you have copied a version of the choice module into the mod directory. - the instructions posted on the forum could be a little misleading. it mentions to copy the existing files and keep them as a backup - copy to somewhere else outside your moodle install. - then replace the files in your moodle install with the ones posted in the forum. because you now have 2 copies of the choice mod in your install, I would suggest you go to the admin/modules page, and \"hide\" the one listed \"copy of choice\" - don't delete it because it might delete data from your original choice mod. then go back to the \"copy of choice\" directory - you shuold be safe deleting this, as it will not affect your choice data directly. then make sure that you have copied the new files from the forum into the normal mod\\choice directory. hope that helps!\nComment 2: Dan-- you are amazing man... thanks a lot.it is OK NOW>\nLabel: ",

Anybody have any ideas??? thank frank\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Frank, Sadly, as far as I know students can not make choices or other activities - only course creators and admins can do that. This is quite a popular request so, apparently fine-tunable roles are coming in soonish, perhaps in Moodle 2. A hack would be possible but it would not be trivial.\nComment 2: One possibility is that students create a GIFT file with the questions (I use a WIKI to allow it). The sintax is quite easy and my students have no problems with it.  Then I upload the questions an create the Test.\nLabel: ",

RE: I just got a request from management that the exam signups in Moodle must allow students to print a signup confirmation. Well, I have just successfully added this option to Choice. It is a hack and I somehow think it should be a hack since it will probably always need to be customized for local needs. However, adding it is quite simple: an extra field in the database , a few new language strings, an extra php file, and a few extra lines in view.php.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: shouldn't this simply be a print button on the page that shows their selection? - see the screen that shows when a student has selected a choice and they are unable to update it. - why do you need an extra field in the db? Dan\nComment 2: I display both a print icon and textual link. Just so it is clear what will be printed. The link does not actually print but displays a confirmation page which contains course info, student's name and id-number, choice answer, answer date, print date, and confirmation id (unique code to stove off falsification) formatted for printing. Students have to print it themselves. The extra field in db is a flag to control which choice instances display this option. We have probably a dozen choices on the site but only one requires this option (another one still coming).\nLabel: ",

If I understand correctly, the limit setting for each option allows me to cap how many people sign up for each date. I need that. I need also to be able to block certain students from signing up, and that is clearly not supported. Is something coming up in the enhanced module preannounced in summer? I thought to make an exclusion list using the interface like assigning students to groups. However, this would require modifying the database , so ain't so trivial. I wonder whether in the interim I could whack it using groups. I'd have to be able to block one group from participating. Another alternative is for me to clone the choice into a new module. This would free me from worrying about backwards compatibility. The catch is that I need it before Xmas.\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

How can I copy the choice module two every week of my course. Thanks for your help.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: There isn't a quick and easy way of doing this, but if you are semi-familiar with XML, I would be tempted to do this doing a backup of the course, and editing the moodle.xml page. Create a Choice in the 1st week of your course, then do a full backup of your course and save it seperately just in case you break something! then create a backup file with only the data you want - eg don't backup the user data and only include the choice module. - open a new copy of the moodle.xml file created inside the backup zip file. now follow the instructions in the attached file to this post - I couldn't get moodle to display the XML tags properly, so put these in a seperate file! after making the changes given in the attached file., restore the file - I would suggest to a new course first to make sure you didn't break anything! and then if that works restore it to your own course \"adding data to it\" - (you will end up with 2 choices in the first section, but you can just delete one of them!) Good luck!!\nLabel: ",

Server crashes don't seem to help when one is learning a new program! Cheers, ptervin...still countless\nComment 3: It's a bummer - I don't have any ideas on this one, nor have I seen it before. The Choice code is not particularly complex, though, so debugging the problem shouldn't be too hard. There are three tricks I use to solve almost every Moodle problem: 1) Turn on the 'debug' variable in \"Configure Variables\" - when you try the Choice you might get a new error message that provides a clue. 2) Add this: $db->debug = true; somewhere in the code. This will make all the SQL statements visible on the page. 3) Add lines like: print_object($variable); in the code to get dumps of objects, arrays or plain variables, so you can track what data is going where.\nLabel: ",

I want it to work like the \"Moodle features demo\" - \"Choices\" - \"A Choice with non-anonymous results.\" Any idea what I'm doing wrong? Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

I have several papers running at the same time and need to have the same 'choice' question running in several places. Is it possible to set one up and somehow cut and paste the same question and answer selection to other papers - I know that there may be difficulties with this (especially as the software will probably have where the results are to be analysed and collated), but it would save much time if there was a way!!\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

I have been playing around with using the quiz module for this, where we'd create a \"quiz\" each week that consisted of a single question with the ability to select several answer choices (each event they want to participate in) or a \"quiz\" where each event has a \"yes I want to attend this\" or \"No thank you\" response.  Then the student's name and their \"quiz\" results would be sent to the Residential Director who could create the list of those actually attending. The things that I think are missing though is a time-stamp so activities can be filled on a first-come-first-served basis with overflow going on a waiting list, or a way to set a limit to the number that can sign up for a particular event.  It would also be wonderful if we could have the Residential Director get a list of who selected which choices, in time order, but that's probably asking a bit much from a quiz module. Thomas Robb suggested that I take a look at the choice module, but the messages I've seen indicate that choices are limited to six options, which rather puts a crimp on how we can do the sign-ups when we run 20 to 25 activities each weekend.  We could seperate out in batches of 6 activities, but I'd rather just have a field of check boxes that the students can click on the activities they want to sign up for. Now, I haven't tried playing around with choice yet to make it fit, but can I get the outputs sorted by choice and time-stamp order?  That is, everyone who selected \"Grocery Trip, Fri, 3:15-4:15\" in the order that they submitted their request so that we can just fill up the vans and the rest are put on a waiting list when the van capacity is full? Also, is it possible to select more than one choice per question?  Sorry, I know I should probably try playing around with this myself, but I haven't had the time to get to it yet, and if these aren't possible, I'll keep trying to play with the quiz module.\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

I've just discovered your very cool program and am extremely excited about adding it to my site! However, it looks like my usage will be a bit difference than most of your other examples. I run a website for a large, worldwide historical re-creation group called the Society for Creative Anachronism (\"SCA\") which researches and recreates the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. I will be using Moodle to allow various people in the SCA to offer classes on subjects they have researched.  As such, I don't have a pre-set, 100% reliable teacher base. Consequently, I'd love to be able to have the students rate the teachers after the class re: skill, knowledge, responsiveness, etc. so that I can weed out the not so good ones. Is there any function for something like this? Or any chance of one in a future version? Regardless, this looks like an awesome program and I'm thrilled to have found it! Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Creating new surveys currently requires a bit of hacking, but eventually there will be a nice GUI for this. In the meantime, the existing 'COLLES' survey should go some way to helping you understand the effectiveness of the class (with graphs etc). You could also use the 'choice' module to conduct polls on specific questions.\nComment 2: Great! I hadn't thought of using those that way, that oughta do it! Thanks again.\nLabel: ",
