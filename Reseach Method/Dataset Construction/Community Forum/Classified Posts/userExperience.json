Most days, I shrug my shoulders and carry on. Today (yes, this is a rant) I spent over three hours building a learning plan for a new student. this student has unique competency requirements, so it could not be duplicated from an existing LPT. This one single, student has 106 competencies. Adding each competency is an extremely manual process, but worse than that the Learning plan Template view has no automated ordering capabilities. None. Each competency has to be moved, manually using a UI that looks for like a DOS screen than a modern UI. Just having some method for automated ordering would save me hours every week.\nLabel: ",

Is there any way to have a navigation , course catalog / course grouping like feature in moodle (similar to what Workplace version has: https://docs.moodle.org/500/en/Catalogue ), I would love to know about it. I have been searching day and night for some type of course categorization and filtering feature that would allow end-users to browse courses rather than just have a long list of courses, and I have not found anything yet. Would love to have something for users that can then choose to enroll in those courses (after they filter), and then would also love to use this categorization for users that are auto-enrolled by their organization rules (dynamic cohorts and rules), so that they can also browse the course catalog. Ideally, would be able to select which courses are available for self-enrollment by cohort  which I think should already work, but I have not found a course catalog like plugin or feature to use. Please help. Monika\nLabel: ",

Is there a way to view the total number of questions directly in the interface? I would like to see the total number of questions, including those in subcategories. This feature has always been very useful, as it was available in Moodle 4.1, but I am unable to find it in the current version. Could someone kindly advise how to access this information? Thank you in advance. Best, susana\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

For each resource, there's a comment section about that resource. Any ideas?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: The core Comment Block does this for content level - add it to the course page, choose the \"Any Page\" setting, and it will treat the block as unique for the course page and for each activity. However, it does not treat course \"Sections\" as unique. A 3rd Party plugin to consider for Section pages might be: https://moodle.org/plugins/block_course_discuss - The advantage to this plugin is it puts the discussion \"in\" the content area instead of a \"block\" off to the side ( IF your theme supports that).\nComment 2: thank you for the reply it was very helpful, though i would like to know if there's an option where the comment section always get created when a content is created, so i don't have to create it manually each time.\nComment 3: Yes, once the \"Comment Block\" is added to the course page with the \"any page\" setting enabled, then all newly added activities would countinue get a copy of that block. For the 3rd party plugin, I do not think so, I think it has to be manually added to each activity, but I've not used it so I can't say for sure. But if you can download it to try it out, then I'd say treat it like the \"Comment Block\" by try adding it to the course page with the add to \"any page\" setting (then, add a comment into it on the course page, such as \"Course Page Test\". Then, add a new activity to the course and see if it that 3rd party plugin automatically is inside the new activity, and see if it is 'blank' or if it includes that \"Course Page test\" comment.\nLabel: ",

Most days, I shrug my shoulders and carry on. Today (yes, this is a rant) I spent over three hours building a learning plan for a new student. this student has unique competency requirements, so it could not be duplicated from an existing LPT. This one single, student has 106 competencies. Adding each competency is an extremely manual process, but worse than that the Learning plan Template view has no automated ordering capabilities. None. Each competency has to be moved, manually using a UI that looks for like a DOS screen than a modern UI. Just having some method for automated ordering would save me hours every week.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: It's way easier with the enrol_Programs plugin, including block_programs.

Is there any way to have a navigation , course catalog / course grouping like feature in moodle (similar to what Workplace version has: https://docs.moodle.org/500/en/Catalogue ), I would love to know about it. I have been searching day and night for some type of course categorization and filtering feature that would allow end-users to browse courses rather than just have a long list of courses, and I have not found anything yet. Would love to have something for users that can then choose to enroll in those courses (after they filter), and then would also love to use this categorization for users that are auto-enrolled by their organization rules (dynamic cohorts and rules), so that they can also browse the course catalog. Ideally, would be able to select which courses are available for self-enrollment by cohort  which I think should already work, but I have not found a course catalog like plugin or feature to use. Please help. Monika\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

No : Course is visible only to enrolled users and does not appear on the front page.

Here are the aspect ratios in the following areas: My courses - 10 : 7 Recently accessed courses -  191 : 75 Catalogue - 265∶144 Program (Workplace) 3:2 This is frustrating.

Sometimes, the behavior of images can vary depending on the selected theme, as each one may have its own settings and specific dimensions. Additionally, could you share a screenshot of the areas where you notice these differences? This will help us better understand what's happening and find a more targeted solution. Sometimes, the theme's CSS can be adjusted to harmonize proportions and avoid these visual inconsistencies. Eduardo Kraus Teacher and programmer\nLabel: ",
