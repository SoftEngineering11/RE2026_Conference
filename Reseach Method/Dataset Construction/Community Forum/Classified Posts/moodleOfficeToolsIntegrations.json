I understand `local_msgraph` previously enabled Graph API features like calendar sync, user matching, and authenticated meeting join — but I can't find a version that supports Moodle 4.4+. Is there an updated version of `local_msgraph` for Moodle 4.4.5+? Or are there alternative ways to enable full Graph API support in newer Moodle versions? Any guidance, links, or insights would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance! Shameer P\nLabel: ",

We have users in different countries in Europe and in Americas and for all of the users country is synced as it is in Entra ID. The exception are users from Romania who in Entra have Romania as country but in Moodle it syncs the country as Oman. I have manually changed country from Oman to Romania and then run the sync again and the sync changed it back to Oman. What can have caused this? Second question is how can i remove already synced fields if I am not interested in syncyng them anymore? I have synced telephone numbers but now i want to remove them from Moodle. I have set field_map_phone1 & field_map_phone2 to not mapped but phone numbers are still there. How can I remove them?\nLabel: ",

We put the plugin collection of Microsoft 365 ( https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=72 ) onto our Moodle a couple of years ago. I've recently noticed Microsoft now have an LTI integration. Can you put both into one Moodle or will they interfere with each other? Or is the LTI supposed to replace the plugin collections? Basically I don't want to break something that is working as the authentication mechanism only to find the LTI version means all the current accounts suddenly won't work etc. I've read it all a couple of times, but I just can't work out whether I will be making more mess than I'm solving. Does anyone know if you can put both on at once or whether it should be one or the other and never both? Thank you\nLabel: ",

I have created a GitHub Issue [ here ] discussing this issue and detailing where documentation needs to be reviewed/updated, including Moodle Documents. As it stands, Teams Chat Bots cannot be created using existing guides. That's a weekend I'm not getting back. Hopefully this can be fixed up soon. David.\nLabel: ",

We've recently launched our moodle site and are authenticating against our Azure AD. The sync is up and running - users are created and updated - but most profile fields that we have mapped are not included in that. When a user is created, they have an email address, location (country and city), and that's it. When they login for the first time, the rest of their profile is filled out: supervisor, job title, department, etc, etc. I've checked the mapping, and it is all set up to be updated on creation, every login, and every user sync task - but it's not. Any ideas what we might have missed? Thanks!\nLabel: ",

I have one buggy thing going on that I can't seem to crack. All users sync with Office 365, this instructor's course doesn't sync with Teams (we do it by request), and she does encourage students to sync with their Outlook calendar (which is a cron that never ends). This instructor is finding items in her Sent folder in outlook and they're meeting requests for events in Moodle. They're also for last year, not an active course/semester. So my question: Is this expected (the meeting request from an instructor)? If so, do you have any ideas why it's running on closed courses? She's not accessing the courses to trigger anything. If it's not, can you speculate what may be happening so I can ask my O365 admin to pursue more specific areas? Thank you!\nLabel: ",

We had hoped that we could make existing Moodle courses link to existing MS Teams. I can't seem to make it do that. If I choose to make one Moodle course sync it then creates an MS Team.

We populate Teams from our MIS system - as in Team creation and students going into and being withdrawn from. We don't do that in Moodle.

We are using active directory for authenticating users.  My uderstanding is that users has to be logged via OpenID Connect to his Office365 account to be able to have a full integration with Office365 / Teams. I saw that there is a script to change the authenticating method of existing user matching his username in Azure but we are not quite ready to change the authentication methos of all our users to openid Connect. This is would be a too heavy change for our users. I understand that tere is a possibility for a user to link his actual moodle account with hos office365 one. But this I would want to avoid too because this is complex. So my question is what feature of Moodle teams integration do actually need the user to be logged via OpenID Connet or having his moodle account linked to his Office365 one? Reading all the documentation I could and a little bit of the plugin code,,  here is my present uderstanding : -  The moodle course synchronization to teams does not need users to be connected with his office365. It just needs the opeindc plugin to be configured and the link between Moodle and Azure to be established - The moodle tab inside teams. I'm not sure but here I thing that the user has to have an openIDC acount to use it. Or is it a simple iframe? - Notifications of moodle course to teams. This is done by the moodle bot (if i'm right) but I d'ont know if users have to have an openidc moodle account Do I forgot some features of moodle teams integration? I'm a little lost here and I can't test this integration by now. If someone could clarify for me which features do we lost if our users log in with manual auth. Thank you very much in advance.

This will include two changes: Cookies without a '''SameSite''' attribute will be treated as SameSite=Lax. Cookies with '''SameSite=None''' must also specify '''Secure''', meaning they require a secure context . The changes are explained in https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained and https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/developers-get-ready-for-new.html . Moodle and Microsoft Teams integration will be affected by this change, because the integration requires embedding Moodle pages in Teams. There is an open item in Moodle Tracker about this change in broader context at https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-67175 , but the code change proposed in the tracker item didn't get integrated in time for the last minor Moodle upgrade before Chrome 80 release date. As a result, all sites using Moodle and Microsoft Teams integration feature are strongly suggested to apply the patches proposed in the tracker item so that users with Chrome 80 can keep using Moodle tabs in Teams after upgrade. Patches are provided for all Moodle versions that are supported for core feature and security issues, i.e. 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. Patches are only required before this is integrated into the next Moodle minor release of the Moodle versions, which is scheduled at March 9th, 2020. After the next Moodle minor release, the patch should be removed as it would be integration into core Moodle code.\nLabel: ",

One thing that seems to be causing problems is the language settings. We were all previously set to 'en_us,' but now everyone seems to be automatically switched over to 'en.' When looking at the user field mapping for Office 365 integration, it does show that Moodle's language setting should map to the Office 365 language setting. In my case, I have verified that my language settings in Office 365 are set to 'English (United States),' but my Moodle language always reverts to 'en' instead. I've tried manually changing the setting back to 'en_us,' but the next time I log in, it goes back to 'en.' Is this a bug in either Moodle or the Office 365 integration? I'm not sure why the language setting does not seem to be respected. I suppose I could just delete the language mapping, but I'm curious why it's not working.\nLabel: ",

Each school in our group has a separate tenant in Office 365/Azure AD. I'm trying to set up a testing environment in Azure AD to test out the O365 plugins on our staging environment. When I get to \"Step 3/3: Admin consent & additional information\" of the Office 365 plugin setup, I click the link, it takes me to the O365 signin page, I click to sign in but nothing happens - the signin page stays on 'pick an account' - if I click the account that I set up as admin of Azure (free trial account) the page either just reloads, saying that I am signed in. Anyone else had this issue? I'm currently using my personal old hotmail account for this - I guess it might be worth setting up a new trial O365 account. Any other thoughts? Cheers Chris\nLabel: ",

I thought that, at its simplest, the concept was, for example: You have, for example, a Word document in your OneDrive or Google drive or Drop box, that you want to submit as your Assignment. Instead of downloading the file to your desktop, then reuploading it, if you Moodle site admin has set up the right plugins, you can just select the file directly in the file-picker (after logging in to the other system.) What acutally seems to happen is that, for example, a student can only pick a file from OneDrive if it is an institutional onedrive that you are providing to students. If the student is already using a personal onedrive account, they are out of luck. Have I got that right? It seems a bit disappointing if so.\nLabel: ",

Google integration - non-matching email addresses\nPost description: Hi, At our institution, users have different email addresses for their AD and Google accounts. Their main Moodle email address is the one stored in AD e.g. 12345678@student.school.edu and the Google email address is *nearly* the same, but not quite e.g. 12345678@google.school.edu. We store the Google email address in a custom Moodle profile field. I am able to set up a Google OAuth2 service successfully, but there is an issue when users attempt to login to Moodle using their Google account, as the email addresses don't match. To avoid this issue, I probably *could* change the main email addresses stored in Moodle to the Google ones, but I am concerned this will cause more issues than it solves (Moodle is integrated with more services than just Google). Also, it would affect the way Moodle accounts are created and maintained. Does anyone know if there is a way to avoid this issue? Perhaps by specifying an 'alternate email' address in the OAuth services. Cheers, Fred\nLabel: ",

I'm running a VPS; CentOS 6, Apache and Moodle 3.0 stable. I actually have done this twice, the first time I thought i broke it by playing with permissions, so i did a fresh install, locally and on my server . Locally was a test and is fine, but on my server I install the plugins by git with the relavant branch. The site acknowledges and installs them then loading the next page \"moodle/admin/upgradesettings.php?\" errors. From here when I try to access my site I get a blank page. The page I seem to be able to load is moodle/login Strangely I can manually delete \"/moodle/auth/oidc\" and when I load the site it detects its missing and goes through the install bit again, then the upgradesettings page errors again. I also can't go anywhere else as i;m stuck in the install dependency loop I've check the server error logs but they are empty, I tried to add debugging to my config.php nothing comes out as the page doesnt seem to load.

I understand `local_msgraph` previously enabled Graph API features like calendar sync, user matching, and authenticated meeting join — but I can't find a version that supports Moodle 4.4+. Is there an updated version of `local_msgraph` for Moodle 4.4.5+? Or are there alternative ways to enable full Graph API support in newer Moodle versions? Any guidance, links, or insights would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance! Shameer P\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

We have users in different countries in Europe and in Americas and for all of the users country is synced as it is in Entra ID. The exception are users from Romania who in Entra have Romania as country but in Moodle it syncs the country as Oman. I have manually changed country from Oman to Romania and then run the sync again and the sync changed it back to Oman. What can have caused this? Second question is how can i remove already synced fields if I am not interested in syncyng them anymore? I have synced telephone numbers but now i want to remove them from Moodle. I have set field_map_phone1 & field_map_phone2 to not mapped but phone numbers are still there. How can I remove them?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Andrei, regarding to your first question: there was a bug in an o365 plugin version that could be causing your problem.

Basically I don't want to break something that is working as the authentication mechanism only to find the LTI version means all the current accounts suddenly won't work etc. I've read it all a couple of times, but I just can't work out whether I will be making more mess than I'm solving.

However, I have a problem with the users assigned to the course. I was assigning 4 users/members (teacher and students) to the Moodle course. After I synced it to the Teams, suddenly the numbers of assigned members in Teams got increased to 293 members (meanwhile, it's still 4 members assigned to the course in the Moodle site). There were many random users (users from my moodle site) got enrolled to the course in Teams. Is there anyone here ever experience this situation? How you resolve this problem? I'm using Moodle 3.10.1+ (Build: 20210204). Thanks in advance for any help.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Alfin - I recently installed the Microsoft 365 and Moodle integration. Similarly, I have Teams working and am able to display the course within the Teams Moodle app tab. It is not clear to me how the sync of users (teachers and members) works. I have been getting mixed results. If I add a teacher, they are automatically added as an owner and the Team shows up for them in the Teams app; however, the behavior for adding members and when they show up remains a bit of a mystery to me. Have you been able to resolve your issue and if so what have you discovered? Peace - Anthony\nLabel: ",

I have one buggy thing going on that I can't seem to crack. All users sync with Office 365, this instructor's course doesn't sync with Teams (we do it by request), and she does encourage students to sync with their Outlook calendar (which is a cron that never ends). This instructor is finding items in her Sent folder in outlook and they're meeting requests for events in Moodle. They're also for last year, not an active course/semester. So my question: Is this expected (the meeting request from an instructor)? If so, do you have any ideas why it's running on closed courses? She's not accessing the courses to trigger anything. If it's not, can you speculate what may be happening so I can ask my O365 admin to pursue more specific areas? Thank you!\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

We had hoped that we could make existing Moodle courses link to existing MS Teams. I can't seem to make it do that. If I choose to make one Moodle course sync it then creates an MS Team. We don't want the Moodle courses replicating in Teams -we do want the OneNote Notebook to link up to an existing Team. We populate Teams from our MIS system - as in Team creation and students going into and being withdrawn from. We don't do that in Moodle. Moodle is more a self enrolment and we just want the OneNote Notebook to link through from the Moodle course to a specific MS Team. Is that possible does anyone know?

The School Data Sync is becoming a better tool for creation of educational groups in Microsoft 365, and the microsoft 365 plugin now facilitates well the creation of teams based on cohorts/courses in Moodle. But it's becoming more and more interesting to have the source for groups (organisational and educational) in Microsoft 365 and let apps plugin to School Data Sync api. So is there anyone who has succeeded in creating cohorts based on the School Data Sync structure, so  the education groups in MS 365, Azure AD are primary source and then used to create also the groupstruture an enrollment of students and teachers into it within Moodle? And so the question, is it working, how well?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Remko, I'm editing the School Data Sync code now just for a bit of fun - it wasnt working at first because Microsoft change their key fields from 'objectid' to 'id'. I also decided to make it also able to create cohorts. At this point, is working without enrolling students in their cohorts, but Im getting there..so hopefully in a few days I should be completed. regards, Brad\nLabel: ",

We are using active directory for authenticating users.  My uderstanding is that users has to be logged via OpenID Connect to his Office365 account to be able to have a full integration with Office365 / Teams. I saw that there is a script to change the authenticating method of existing user matching his username in Azure but we are not quite ready to change the authentication methos of all our users to openid Connect. This is would be a too heavy change for our users. I understand that tere is a possibility for a user to link his actual moodle account with hos office365 one. But this I would want to avoid too because this is complex. So my question is what feature of Moodle teams integration do actually need the user to be logged via OpenID Connet or having his moodle account linked to his Office365 one? Reading all the documentation I could and a little bit of the plugin code,,  here is my present uderstanding : -  The moodle course synchronization to teams does not need users to be connected with his office365. It just needs the opeindc plugin to be configured and the link between Moodle and Azure to be established - The moodle tab inside teams. I'm not sure but here I thing that the user has to have an openIDC acount to use it. Or is it a simple iframe? - Notifications of moodle course to teams. This is done by the moodle bot (if i'm right) but I d'ont know if users have to have an openidc moodle account Do I forgot some features of moodle teams integration? I'm a little lost here and I can't test this integration by now. If someone could clarify for me which features do we lost if our users log in with manual auth. Thank you very much in advance.

We use LDAP . We are adding in the MS Teams integration to our MKoodle. There i s guidance on this page https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Office365#Switching_existing_Moodle_users_to_use_Office_365_to_log_in about switching existing users to office 365 login. This is quite convoluted and requires the learners to go to a block and do all sorts of things. Is there any reason an admin can't just go to manage users and switch the log in method from LDAP to the open id? Will I fundamentally break something if I do that? We want all users who currently use LDAP as the login method to switch to openid. Switch one off and turn the other on. Basically does the account have to migrate or can I just switch it? Thank you. Heather\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: You probably need to use \"User matching\" (cf. https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Office365#User_Matching ) to match existing LDAP accounts with corresponding Office 365 accounts and change the login method to OpenID. You have to create a once-off CSV file listing the current users.\nComment 2: Hi I think we must be doing this all wrong. I can get the CSV in there and make the cron run to force a sync but it doesn't happen. The people just sit in a queue forever. The users never sync. I'm also slightly confused by the instructions - should I have done a bulk update on my users first to make their accounts open id and change their username and then do the user matching or will the usermatching if it ever works do everything? I have actually tried it both ways - updating a user and then tried the sync thing, and also not updating the user and trying the sync. The sync just doesn't happen. I've even tried a manual match on the sync page and that just tells me to log in with the Moodle user first which I can't because I've changed it. Basically I'm beginning to think this won't work unless the user goes to the Microsoft block and does half of it for themselves which is a bit over complex for my learners. Is it possible to do without the user going to the Microsoft block?\nLabel: ",

This will include two changes: Cookies without a '''SameSite''' attribute will be treated as SameSite=Lax. Cookies with '''SameSite=None''' must also specify '''Secure''', meaning they require a secure context . The changes are explained in https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained and https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/developers-get-ready-for-new.html . Moodle and Microsoft Teams integration will be affected by this change, because the integration requires embedding Moodle pages in Teams. There is an open item in Moodle Tracker about this change in broader context at https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-67175 , but the code change proposed in the tracker item didn't get integrated in time for the last minor Moodle upgrade before Chrome 80 release date. As a result, all sites using Moodle and Microsoft Teams integration feature are strongly suggested to apply the patches proposed in the tracker item so that users with Chrome 80 can keep using Moodle tabs in Teams after upgrade. Patches are provided for all Moodle versions that are supported for core feature and security issues, i.e. 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. Patches are only required before this is integrated into the next Moodle minor release of the Moodle versions, which is scheduled at March 9th, 2020. After the next Moodle minor release, the patch should be removed as it would be integration into core Moodle code.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: The patch in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-67175 is still not final. But are you using it as is? Would Moodle do an out of band release version with the patch?\nLabel: ",

One thing that seems to be causing problems is the language settings. We were all previously set to 'en_us,' but now everyone seems to be automatically switched over to 'en.' When looking at the user field mapping for Office 365 integration, it does show that Moodle's language setting should map to the Office 365 language setting. In my case, I have verified that my language settings in Office 365 are set to 'English (United States),' but my Moodle language always reverts to 'en' instead. I've tried manually changing the setting back to 'en_us,' but the next time I log in, it goes back to 'en.' Is this a bug in either Moodle or the Office 365 integration? I'm not sure why the language setting does not seem to be respected. I suppose I could just delete the language mapping, but I'm curious why it's not working.\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

We have mapped this to both the \"Institution Name\" and a custom user field, and it is this custom user field that can be used to enrol users into a cohort using the \"Profile field based cohort membership\" plugin. You can then use an enrolment method of a \"Cohort Sync\" in the course, and et voila. As a side option, we also use the \"Cohort role synchronization\" plugin to add a role to the users in the cohort, and this now allows us to show (or hide) course categories to those users.\nComment 3: @nikolas, I believe we have achieved what we need to with the use of a couple of plugins (albeit I would still like to see this functionality in the native O365 plugin). * Profile field based cohort membership * Cohort role synchronization\nLabel: ",

If I'm not wrong the issues was fixed by reconfiguring your server for internet connection. There was no Internet connection in the server and therefore it could not authenticate users from 3rd party platform.

I work at a college so will be talking about student accounts Situation: User 1: Krillin Son (email: kson@school.edu) User 2: KaioShin Son (email: kson_inactive@school.edu) _inactive as they are no longer a student and needed to change it so Krillin Son could use kson@school.edu account. User 2 is no longer in AD, Office 365 or Azure. This account is only in Moodle. User 1 can login to Moodle via basic login with username kson and their password and get into their account. But when they try to login via the Microsoft SSO button with email kson@school.edu and their password. It will show User 2's account. After investigating and going to Gear>Plugins>Local Plugins>Microsoft Office 365 Integration>Advanced>Manage User Connections. I noticed that User 2 is still showing a connections to email address kson@school.edu. I enabled the Match button on User 1 and User 2 clicked Unmatch for User 2. But when User 1 logs in with kson@school.edu it still shows User 2 account. From the Manage User Connection section I have no other changes I can make to remove User 2's connection to kson@school.edu Any help would be great. thanks Alex\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

To be more specific it is not the MSA from the premium AAD but the free MFA that is available for all O365 global admin, password are also authenticated over my ADFS infrastructure so local user are full SSO and Internet user receive the Microsoft login treatment. So it could definitely work.\nComment 2: Hello, In order to work the MFA in moodle, was there any specific configuration? Can you be more specific?\nComment 3: Hi, I installed the O365 integration folowing these instruction https://docs.moodle.org/34/en/Office365 and it just worked out of the box for me, MFA user could logon as well as non MFA one. Moodle is version 3.4.2 So no there was no MFA specific config to the configuration to make it work on my installation, user logon experience is exactly the same on Moodle as it is for Outlook web acces for example.\nLabel: ",

I work for a group of schools which has a couple of group-wide Moodle installations. We use Office 365/Azure Active Directory for identity management. Each school in our group has a separate tenant in Office 365/Azure AD. I'm trying to set up a testing environment in Azure AD to test out the O365 plugins on our staging environment. When I get to \"Step 3/3: Admin consent & additional information\" of the Office 365 plugin setup, I click the link, it takes me to the O365 signin page, I click to sign in but nothing happens - the signin page stays on 'pick an account' - if I click the account that I set up as admin of Azure (free trial account) the page either just reloads, saying that I am signed in. Anyone else had this issue? I'm currently using my personal old hotmail account for this - I guess it might be worth setting up a new trial O365 account. Any other thoughts? Cheers Chris\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Ok, so I answered my own question - setting up a clean O365 test account worked. I'm now trying to test the multi tenant options - when I click on Multitenancy, I always get 'Please complete the plugin setup process before adding additional tenants.' Even though the plugin is set up and syncing correctly. Any ideas?\nComment 2: Bumping this - any ideas as to why I'm always getting \"Please complete the plugin setup process before adding additional tenants.\" Even though it is set up correctly?\nComment 3: Hi Chris, If it's okay with you, we'd like to move the discussion to the GitHub issue you raised at https://github.com/Microsoft/o365-moodle/issues/247 .

I thought that, at its simplest, the concept was, for example: You have, for example, a Word document in your OneDrive or Google drive or Drop box, that you want to submit as your Assignment. Instead of downloading the file to your desktop, then reuploading it, if you Moodle site admin has set up the right plugins, you can just select the file directly in the file-picker (after logging in to the other system.) What acutally seems to happen is that, for example, a student can only pick a file from OneDrive if it is an institutional onedrive that you are providing to students. If the student is already using a personal onedrive account, they are out of luck. Have I got that right? It seems a bit disappointing if so.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: student can only pick a file from OneDrive if it is an institutional onedrive that you are providing to students What does make you to think that?

Its very hard to select one time that suits everyone so hopefully this will cover most. We will be using ZOOM for the discussion, which works on all devices.

How certain is it that this will be developed for 3.3? Cheers, Fred\nComment 2: Just confirming - the requirements for this project and some info on the implementation is listed in this document: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Better_Office_Integrations_3.3 This has been updated based on the feedback we got from the community meeting - thanks to all who attended. We will be starting work on this project soon. If anyone has feedback or questions - please reply to this thread.\nComment 3: Some extra REQs / comments: REQ 2: This spec seems to very heavily lean on plain OAuth which I'd question a little bit given that it's only an access protocol and not an identity protocol. It would be better to use the superset protocol OIDC instead. REQ 4: I'd add the extra requirement that an admin should be able to set this up so a student doesn't need to approve the connection. This is mostly external to moodle, but it's critical to the user experience so needs to be possible and documented. REQ 6: As above, if the admin has auto-approved this across a domain you shouldn't be able to manage this (or even see this?). REQ 11: Please not google search, it should be deterministic and not require internet. eg it could detect strings from lorem ipsum. This should be coverable by behat.\nComment 4: REQ 11: it may be that crot plugin is doing what we need here, have a look at https://moodle.org/plugins/plagiarism_crot\nComment 5: Can you clarify point 3 in REQ 2 please? From my interpretation of it you'd have this situation: a student who has an existing Moodle account provided by the university clicks on \"login with Office 365\", authenticates successfully and - as Moodle can't match these OAuth details to an existing account - gets a new Moodle account. In that case, I'd expect the student to be given the option to log in to their existing account and link the OAuth details to it. I guess it depends on the meaning of \"matching\" in this context , and I may well be misinterpreting that as some kind of automated thing, so some clarification would be useful.\nComment 6: Hi, I may have missed it but I could not find anything in the specs about grading/annotating files stored in the office suite (e.g. G Suite or Office 365). Will there be provision for documents to be marked using the Moodle grading interface? This would be most useful for organisations that use advanced grading methods, such as rubrics or advanced grading for example. Cheers, Fred\nComment 7: Based on the townhall the goal was to have a minimum viable product integration. I think grading while nice was not considered MVP.\nComment 8: Hi Jason, Thanks for the response. That would be a real shame, as from a teaching/learning perspective being able to 'close' the feedback loop is an absolute must. Does anyone know how teachers will be able to feedback on documents submitted by students? I assumed that the documents uploaded by students would be converted to PDF, to make them accessible to the plagiarism plugins (for example), and that they would sit nicely in the Moodle grading interface but it seems my assumption was incorrect. If the ability to give feedback easily, and in a manner that is familiar to Moodle users is not available, I am worried this project will be a lot less exciting and useful from a teacher's standpoint. Cheers, Fred\nComment 9: With the recent issues related to PDF Annotations in grading, decided to seek what might be 'out there' in Google La-La-Land which could possibly be an alternative to grading in Moodle. Have setup a GCE Moodle site and have been working on limited Moodle\nintegration with Google.  Google doesn't offer a 'Classroom' for\nindividuals and only those entities that qualify for a Google EDU Domain\ncan set up Classroom (I think).   Google Classroom, BTW , is worth keeping an eye on ... IMHO . Ran across a site and GDocs addon called ﻿ Kaizen. Kaizena https://kaizena.com/ A Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement. Might want to watch these first: Wonder if the folks at Kaizena would be interested, if someone approached, about collaborating on a Moodle 'plugin'? The way I see things ... Moodle has grown too monolithic and needs to start looking into microservices. 'spirit of sharing', Ken\nComment 10: Canvas integrating Google Apps for Education (GAFE) using LTI , is what inspired my to develop a new Google drive resource module . Hope Google will add LTI support to their Education account, which will enable Moodle and other LMS systems integrate and use it more easily.\nComment 11: I'd like to explore if O365 video could be included in some future iteration - the functionality of O365 video is similar to that of 3rd party providers like Kaltura and would be a great way of ensuring moodle can handle video content in a sensible way.\nComment 12: Sensible would be to stick with Kaltura.\nComment 13: Can we confirm that as part of this work the Office 365 and G Suite integrations are going to be created? Or is this project just to create the hooks so that other projects can create the actual integrations using the hooks?\nComment 14: Hi Jason, Did you ever find out? I am looking for exactly the same answer. Cheers, Fred\nComment 15: This project includes the work to make those 2 integrations.\nComment 16: Perfect. Thank you for the clarification. Cheers, Fred\nComment 17: I'm gonna go out on a limb and predict that Dropbox Paper will quickly become the third major player in this space, even though it was only fully released a couple weeks ago. I've been pretty impressed with it so far. I'm not saying it should be supported straight up by moodle but I think it would be prudent to make sure it can fit as well into the overall architecture as 365 and GDocs would. https://paper.dropbox.com/ https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation#paper\nComment 18: Work has started on this project. The first piece is a new OAuth 2 (and OpenID Connect) authentication plugin and a core configuration page for managing OAuth 2 services including setting up a \"system account\" for Moodle (and getting refresh tokens). A prototype is available here: https://prototype.moodle.net/office/\nComment 19: That is fantastic news! Very excited about this development. Can I confirm that the tracker is at https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-57794? I would like to make sure I follow development very closely. Cheers, Fred\nComment 20: Yes that is the Epic for this project and all work will be done on issues within that Epic.\nComment 21: I re-read my last post and it is a bit unclear - what it means is you get \"Login using Google/Facebook/Microsoft\" buttons on the login page and you can configure it to work with many other login systems on the web without installing new plugins etc.\nComment 22: Progress update: Most of the work is completed and the prototype just received a major upgrade. Both core repository plugins (Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive) have been overhauled and work with the new OAuth 2 services. The testing instructions for https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-58220 are very detailed and explain the new functionality. The most significant feature is that there is a new file type that repositories can support which is a \"controlled link\". It is a link to a file - but at the time it is added to Moodle - the original resource is copied into an account owned by the Moodle system. Moodle then grants read and (temporary) write access to the link when it is accessed - based on the permissions in Moodle.\nComment 23: @Damyon Can the work in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-58220 be helpful also for my request in https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=349255 ? Thanks!\nComment 24: Hi Damyon, Thank you for the hard work. I have tested the system a little bit as a teacher and student, and I have a few questions/comments. The login with OAuth, addition of files from Google Drive, etc. all worked well. When I added a file from Google Drive, I was expecting the file to then show in a 'Google Doc' frame inside Moodle, so that if I wanted to continue editing the document - then I could (e.g. similar to the work Nadav has done). Instead a simple link to the Google document is presented to the user. Is what I experienced the expected behaviour? In an assignment, if a student uses a Google Doc as their submitted document, the left-panel of the grading interface attempts to convert the document into a PDF/image to launch the Moodle PDF annotator. Is there a way to only show a Google Doc editor on the left-panel instead, so that the teacher has access to the full set of Google tools for commenting, and the power of Moodle rubrics (and other Moodle grading goodness) at the same time?

As I am more a tech guy than a teacher, I would love to see the embracement of opensource options when it comes to extra functionality. Therefor, I would suggest to have the option open for Collabora online: the libreoffice online solution. (or similar) NextCloud already has the option for collabora online. If Moodle could go that direction it would mean that the opensource background of Moodle stays open for external solutions too.

Google integration - non-matching email addresses\nPost description: Hi, At our institution, users have different email addresses for their AD and Google accounts. Their main Moodle email address is the one stored in AD e.g. 12345678@student.school.edu and the Google email address is *nearly* the same, but not quite e.g. 12345678@google.school.edu. We store the Google email address in a custom Moodle profile field. I am able to set up a Google OAuth2 service successfully, but there is an issue when users attempt to login to Moodle using their Google account, as the email addresses don't match. To avoid this issue, I probably *could* change the main email addresses stored in Moodle to the Google ones, but I am concerned this will cause more issues than it solves (Moodle is integrated with more services than just Google). Also, it would affect the way Moodle accounts are created and maintained. Does anyone know if there is a way to avoid this issue? Perhaps by specifying an 'alternate email' address in the OAuth services. Cheers, Fred\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

This can happen with a marriage/divorce, or an adoption, for example. The username and email address will change for authentication, but will we have to make sure the old account is un-linked in Moodle first? Otherwise, with a different username, Moodle may report that that the account is already linked. Related to that, is there a way to view all linked accounts in the Office 365 Integration local plugin?\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Mind providing those links that are broken? I seem to re-call someting for version 1.9 that did indeed work, but since Google now has Google Classroom, development on a Moodle SSO and greater integration seems to have lost interest. However, there is a plugin that does work ... I do use it. https://moodle.org/plugins/auth_googleoauth2 May not require much on the Moodle end *IF* your school has GAFE and syncs users in GAFE via LDAP but due how either/both handles user accounts, the time to do this 'conversion' would have been before the current school year started. The above plugin, for example, would allow students to login using Google credentials but that would create a new user in Moodle whose actual username is social_user_# and not (for example) john.jones (student login like in LDAP).   So this student (in the example) would actually have two accounts in Moodle ... as the year has begun and student accounts have been either manually assigned student role in courses or students have enrolled themselves.   Any work, assignment submissions, etc. would be associated with old account and not new. Google uses EMail addresses where as Moodle doesn't by default. It would be possible, however, to set install the auth plugin, then manipulate a CSV dump of student users on your system to change the fields that need to be changed ... same sort of thing done when entity has accounts already in Moodle and want to switch to LDAP. Comment: for schools that have 'gone google' it is the way to go IF continuing to use Moodle. 'spirit of sharing', Ken\nComment 2: Hi Ken, The link to the original docs page is https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Google_Apps_Integration . The outdated links referenced in the documentation are https://github.com/cthernandez/moodle-google-apps/tree/master/blocks/gmail and https://moodle.org/plugins/auth_onelogin_saml The latter still sends you to a plugin, but the plugin is very outdated. Thanks for looking!\nComment 3: Docs page says this: Credentials stored in Google Users can login to Moodle using the Google Apps stored credentials\nthrough OAuth2 sign in method. Remember that OpenID 2.0 authentication\nmethod is deprecated and it has been migrated to OAuth 2.0 (OpenID\nConnect). In this case user and mail fields must match in both\nplatforms. Moodle has a third party plugin that has been already\nconfigured to support Google Apps service. The auth plugin link provided to you earlier does use Google Oath2 for authentication. The entire package you found was supposedly supported up to version 2.5+ of Moodle from what I've read of it and included a GMail block.   Nice little feature but not really necessary ... one could create an HTML block OR use drop down menus for school district (GAFE) links. Don't think they'd mind ... here's a link to an ISD that has GAFE domain for the ISD. http://eagles.wisd.net/moodle2/ Note at the top the drop down menus which all point to the ISD Google Domain.  Login does use the auth plugin previously shared.   That doesn't really restrict attempts to login with gmail.com creditials but due the restriction of acceptable EMail domains, a student cannot use their private gmail.com account or hotmail.com or aol.com or other ... must use the Google ISD Domain account. Admin of Google domain gets a notification/request to allow user X with a gmail.com addy or other addy to join the Moodle.   Not a bad thing as this is also a way parents could gain access.   Admin user would have to setup a parent role and assign parent accounts that role so they could only monitor their childs work/courses, etc..  and not participate in activities . I also lurk on the Google Group for Google Classroom.    Been interesting to watch as teachers using GC ask if features could be added that Moodle has had for some time now. Anyway, advantage of using Google Auth for a Moodle means very few files need to be stored in Moodle .... even the videos could be stored in Google Drive and linked to with special permissions like, 'users from domain only'.   Storage is unlimited. Do give up controls over players of multimedia, but you won't miss them. Backups of courses are reduced greatly but they are not 100% restorable to other Moodle servers that are not part of the same ISD Google Domain. Besides that, no teacher or student needs to have a computer or device that has any commercial office suite or viewers installed.    Thus saving tons of $$$ $$'s.   All of what is done is done inside a browser and can be done on smartphones as well as tablets. For an example of  a site that's google but more open ... no ISD domain, go to any of the sandbox sites on: http://sos.tcea.org/ They all allow Google Oath 2 authentication.  If you want to see what it looks like as a teacher, let me know ... and have been known to grant users seeking temporary admin levels to see the backend ... as long as they promise NOT to break it! ;) So your pursuit of Google integration is worth the effort and time. It is, for all practical purposes, single sign on *but* NOT signout - which is the only thing I've found lacking.   That's why the sanboxes have a Google SignOut link in drop down menus.

I also can't go anywhere else as i;m stuck in the install dependency loop I've check the server error logs but they are empty, I tried to add debugging to my config.php nothing comes out as the page doesnt seem to load. Cheers Al\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Ok I manually removed all the related plugins, which enabled me to load into my site, then uninstalled them to clean it up a bit. Now to find out the problem, by the Moodle Plugin Directory I'm installing them one by one and checking to make sure site works; local_o365 ..........ok auth_oidc ..........ok filter_oembed ...already installed (?) repository_office365 .....errors! blocks/microsoft.....ok So now to find out whats wrong with the repository.\nComment 2: Hi Al, If you're running PHP 5.4 we had an incompatibility that has just been resolved and pushed to the plugin database . Please upgrade and let me know that if that fixes the problem. Thanks! - James\nComment 3: Yes I'm on PHP 5.4.28. I just installed it and it asked to update local_o365 and its all good now! Many thanks for the speedy update, looking forward to using it this year. Al\nLabel: "
