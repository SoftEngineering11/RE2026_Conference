In the Hangman game I built a glossary with 10 words without spaces and without special characters, and in the Hangman activity settings I indicated to use 10 words from the glossary. Some words, however, appear multiple times, while others do not appear. The same happens with the Millionaire: I set the quiz with 15 questions and in the Millionaire activity I select No in the \"Randomize questions\" field. Some questions appear multiple times and others are never presented. This creates confusion when the solution to the games is proposed in plenary. Is there some setting to use to avoid this problem? I use version 2024-12-05 on Moodle 4.1.4+ Thanks in advance for the answer.\nLabel: ",

I have been looking at the vast array of excellent available plugins trying to find one that does what I want, but so far have not been able to. The scenario is that I want to display a ladder where Avatar one appears on the left and Avatar two appears on the right. Each Avatar moves up or down their side in response to the answer to a player selected question, selected from pre-existing possibilities. Ideally the player would be able to select which Avatar they wish to play as. An example of how this could be used would Avatar 1 would be Aircraft Passenger, Avatar 2 would be Cabin Crew If the ladder is showing how to maintain calmness in a aircraft Avatar 1 question can I have a drink please. Avatar 2 responses a/ Yes certainly b/ NO! If the player selected b then the Avatar 1 and 2 would move up their sides of the ladder towards disruption at the top. If the player selected a then they would both stay where they were. the next question would again move them up or down the ladder as a result of their response. Does anyone have any suggestions of a plugin that would allow this? Regards Paul\nLabel: ",

Now in the new 2.5 version, we're able to add the chosen game, select all options, but then after clicking on \"save and display\" we're forwarded to the front page (\"My home\" in our instance). We've worked on it for few weeks but at the end been told that's something with the server sharing options, but the former 2.0 Moodle  was installed on the same server as well....so probably there is something else I have 2 questions: a. why this happens?  b. if we install former version of game module for Moodle 2.0 - will it work with 2.5 Moodle?

Even better: Would it be possible to play a mp3-file as joker to make the \"game experience\" more real? Another question regarding the questions: Is it possible to allow a feedback after an answer? The questions allow a feedback, the millionaire-game doesn't. Can this be enabled? It would be nice, to explain correct or wrong answers to the students.

Grade the crossword incorrectly. It will give the wrong grade. When you click on the end of crossword, it will refresh the screen, come back with some of the characters still there and some missing, and incorrect grade. We printed the puzzle before we clicked on the end of crossword puzzle and then checked it against the solution. All was correct, but the grade was not. 3. If I close the web browser, before I finish the puzzle, it will come back with characters missing. On some glossaries I close the puzzle and come back, it is just like I left it. This does not happen with all glossaries. This will happen with either IE 7 or fire fox. I am attaching the glossaries I am having problems with. I am using Moodle 1.9.5.\nLabel: ",

Some words, however, appear multiple times, while others do not appear. The same happens with the Millionaire: I set the quiz with 15 questions and in the Millionaire activity I select No in the \"Randomize questions\" field. Some questions appear multiple times and others are never presented. This creates confusion when the solution to the games is proposed in plenary. Is there some setting to use to avoid this problem?

What am I missing?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: It sounds like you're trying to add questions to a crossword puzzle, but you're getting stuck in the question bank and not being able to add them to the game. Let me guide you through the process: Create or open a crossword puzzle : Make sure you're in the crossword section and have either started a new puzzle or opened an existing one. Access the question bank : In the crossword editor, there’s typically an option to view or manage the question bank. This is where your stored questions live. Select questions from the question bank : Once you're in the question bank, look for a way to either choose or add questions to your current game. Depending on the plugin, this might involve selecting individual questions or importing them into the puzzle. Add questions to the crossword : There should be a button or option to add the selected question to the grid. This might be labeled something like \"Add to Puzzle,\" \"Insert into Grid,\" or simply “Use in Game.” Review the crossword grid : After adding your questions, check that the clues and answers are showing up correctly in the grid, adjusting if necessary. Save and play : Once you’ve added all your questions and clues, save your puzzle and start playing! If you're not seeing an option to add questions to the grid, it might be a specific feature or setting of the plugin you're using. It might help to check the plugin’s documentation or reach out to the support team for more detailed instructions. Regards, ovaroms.com\nLabel: ",

I have been looking at the vast array of excellent available plugins trying to find one that does what I want, but so far have not been able to. The scenario is that I want to display a ladder where Avatar one appears on the left and Avatar two appears on the right. Each Avatar moves up or down their side in response to the answer to a player selected question, selected from pre-existing possibilities. Ideally the player would be able to select which Avatar they wish to play as. An example of how this could be used would Avatar 1 would be Aircraft Passenger, Avatar 2 would be Cabin Crew If the ladder is showing how to maintain calmness in a aircraft Avatar 1 question can I have a drink please. Avatar 2 responses a/ Yes certainly b/ NO! If the player selected b then the Avatar 1 and 2 would move up their sides of the ladder towards disruption at the top. If the player selected a then they would both stay where they were. the next question would again move them up or down the ladder as a result of their response. Does anyone have any suggestions of a plugin that would allow this? Regards Paul\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

We had recently upgraded to Moodle 2.5 and tried the Game module for that version. It's very important for us to have this module. In previous 2.0 version the module worked great. Now in the new 2.5 version, we're able to add the chosen game, select all options, but then after clicking on \"save and display\" we're forwarded to the front page (\"My home\" in our instance). We've worked on it for few weeks but at the end been told that's something with the server sharing options, but the former 2.0 Moodle  was installed on the same server as well....so probably there is something else I have 2 questions: a. why this happens?  b. if we install former version of game module for Moodle 2.0 - will it work with 2.5 Moodle? Thanks for help\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: 1) Download the lastest version of module Game 2) Goto to \"Site administration\" -> \"Development\" -> \"Debugging\" and set \"Debug messagesdebug\" to \"DEVELOPER: ...\" \"Display debug messagesdebugdisplay\" to yes. After that try it again and tell me if you see any message.\nComment 2: Hello Vasilis, we did as advised also installing the latest version of Game mifule.

I also would to here from others who have more experience in something similar. I think the key to all of this is format compatibility.\nComment 2: Hi Eider!

We noticed on the settings page it has an option for \"Select the images of hangman\" with a dropdown that just says \"1.\" We added other folders with images under mod/game/pix/hangman but the folders never show up, no matter how we label the folders or the files. Please let me know if we're missing something. Thanks.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I've been curious about this too. Is this \"select the images of hangman\" not working or a function that has not yet been implemented? Any help on this topic would be appreciated.\nComment 2: Just out of curiosity, I looked at that last week when David originally posed his question, but got interrupted by students before I had a chance to reply. The option 1, appears to be hard coded. It is located in line 213 of mod_form.php which is located at yourmoodle/mod/game/mod_form.pgp. So, you can change pictures a couple of ways. Ask the developers to implement the option, re-write the code yourself to let you actually select a different picture set, replace the set of 7 pictures in folder located....moodle/mod/game/pix/hangman/1 with your own set, add another folder of pictures and change the hard coded 1 to your desired folder. AL\nComment 3: I had a few minutes between grading sessions, and it is actually very easy to fix hangman so that you can use your own pictures, or the original. Create you own set of 7 pictures in a folder named 2 - I used the same names. Place your new folder at yourmoodle/mod/game/pix/hangman/2 Edit line 213 of ...yourmoodle/mod/game/mod_form.php and change it to $a = array( 1 => 1, 2 => 2); Under Game Administration go to Edit settings>Hangman Options>Select the images of hangman  and change it to 2. Try out the game to see your new pictures in use. AL\nComment 4: Would this edit allow for the use of GIF images instead of JPEGs? Or is that hard coded as well? Would that be an easy fix? Thanks in advance.\nComment 5: I don't know about other picture formats. Should be easy to test. Just make a set of gif's or png's and try them. They will either work or they won't. Turn on developer debugging and it should let you know right away. AL\nComment 6: Now does not support multiple set of images and images of different type. On the last of May will be available a version that will support it.\nComment 7: Excellent news. Now I can create a class competition and have students design their own sets of pictures for next year. AL\nComment 8: Al, thanks for the great pointers.

We really appreciates this plugin and the work that you do with it. Thanks for letting us know what we can look forward to.\nComment 9: The last version (2014071317) supports multiple image set and different type of images. To create a second number of images you have to a) go at Home / ► Site administration / ► Plugins / ► Activity modules / ► Manage activities and in the Settings of Game set \" Number of image sets used by hangman\" to 2 b) Go to parameters of game and sets the parameter \" Select the images of hangman \" to 2 c) Create a folder at the mod/game/pix/hangman with name 2 d) In that folder copy the files you want with names hangman_0.jpg, .., hangman_6.jpg Instead of .jpg you can use .png or .gif\nLabel: ",

[array ( 0 => '2718', )] Error code: invalidrecord Stack trace: line 1357 of /lib/dml/moodle_database.php: dml_missing_record_exception thrown line 1333 of /lib/dml/moodle_database.php: call to moodle_database->get_record_select() line 6816 of /lib/accesslib.php: call to moodle_database->get_record() line 2040 of /mod/game/locallib.php: call to context_module::instance() line 2054 of /mod/game/locallib.php: call to game_get_context_module_instance() line 180 of /mod/game/millionaire/play.php: call to game_show_query() line 277 of /mod/game/millionaire/play.php: call to game_millionaire_showgrid() line 81 of /mod/game/millionaire/play.php: call to game_millionaire_ShowNextQuestion() line 22 of /mod/game/millionaire/play.php: call to game_millionaire_play() line 200 of /mod/game/attempt.php: call to game_millionaire_continue() line 175 of /mod/game/attempt.php: call to game_create() line 25 of /mod/game/attempt.php: call to game_do_attempt()\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: The message is \" Error code: invalidrecord\" I think the problem is a database problem. 1) Try to run at database the sql \" SELECT id,course FROM mdl_course_modules WHERE id = 2718\" and tell me what it returns. 2) Try to check and fix table mdl_course_modules\nComment 2: The same problem applies in ALL of our instances (40+) for new and old millionaire games e. g. SELECT id,course FROM {course_modules} WHERE id = ? [array ( 0 => '71', )] Error code: invalidrecord I've tried \"SELECT id,course FROM mdl_course_modules WHERE id = 71\" with empty result - there is no course with an ID of 71. I think the 71 is wrong. The table row for the course with the game in mdl_course_modules looks like: id - course - module -instance -section 452 -   21 -  11 -  71 -  254 Maybe the expected result of the sql should be 452 - 21 ?\nComment 3: I have verified the error in an test environment with older backup files of moodle, moodledata, mod_game and the database. The game in a course with the module version 2013090702 (3.9.7.2 from 07.09.2014 13:34) works fine. I updated the moodle version to the latest 2.5.x and everything is fine too. But if I update then game to the next version 2013120201 (3.12.2.1 from 03.12.2013, 01:45 ) the sql statement fails with the error above. So it should NOT be a database problem.\nComment 4: I fixed a problem. Try the last version ( 3.13.21).\nComment 5: It works! Thanks\nLabel: ",

When she tests the game, it pulls up questions which don't exist in the question bank.  As far as I can tell, they don't exist at all.  I've searched the database for the questions or parts of the questions and get nothing.  This shouldn't be possible. As for my version, which I'm sure someone will say to upgrade...yes, I know.  I'm working on that (July!!!).  But it doesnt solve or even explain the immediate problem.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: When you play the game as a teacher there is a tab named \"Show answers\". There you can see which questions it reads to produce the crossword. Check again the parameters. Maybe it uses a glossary instead of questions. Try the tab \"Show attempts\" and delete the open attempts.\nComment 2: Today our IT support sat down and dug into this.  The game was set to look at the course question bank but the mystery questions were pulling from a glossary in a different course (in a completely different category!).  When we looked at other games we found the same problem.  We went to the course and there were a couple games.   We deleted the games from the course (it isn't currently in use) and all the games everywhere else started working again. The problem is solved but we still don't know why it happened.  I have a suspicion that the glossary may have been created with cut/paste from word and the creators may not have cleaned the HTML out.  Sometimes the html from word is pretty ugly.  The only thing I can think of is that there is something weird in the glossary html that when it got pulled into a game it freaked out the whole module.  I have no idea what sort of HTML could do that but it's the only idea I have.  I'm thinking of cleaning up their glossary (apparently I'm an on-line maid) but haven't gotten the chance.\nComment 3: I haven't looked at all of the glossary entries but of the ones I have looked at, I see paragraph tags and span tags and that's it.  So I think that blows my theory.  Any other ideas?\nLabel: ",

I.e. we want to make one game based on vocabulary from glossary A and another game based on vocabulary from glossary B. Does this module not support groups? I have not found any setting for it.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Now does not support groups. Tell  me more details how imagine this and how will be the parameters. May be I do it in the future.\nComment 2: If I can put my 2 cents worth in as well. I would like to extend the concept of groups to include multiple intelligence. When a student enters a course they are placed in a group.  For the purpose of the games module they will all see the same glossary.   However students in group A would like to work with a specific category of the glossary while other groups have there own categories.  All in the same course.   It would also be very useful if when a student from category A reaches a level of competency they are automatically moved up to a higher level of challenge. The games module is a credit to you and I congratulate you on your exceptional efforts. John\nComment 3: I am not sure what you mean by your question. I am not a developer, so I do not know if there are many ways to do this/different parameters for it. I thought there is a standard way to implement group support: Almost all the core modules and many contributed modules support groups, so that if a module ( both Content or Activity ) is added to a course that has groups and groupings, you can define access and/or visibility for the module in the interface for editing the module. If your module supported groups (and, by the way, support for Grade category would also be great!), there would be a section under editing the module (the interface where you choose what game to use, where questions are taken from, game specific settings, etc.) called \" Common module settings \" It would have boxes and choices Group mode Grouping Available for group members only Visible ID number Grade category As far as I know (and the title for the section is Common module settings, after all) this is standard interface/parameters for modules. If you look at the Edit/Settings page of any core activity, for example a Quiz, you will see what I mean (you may have to click the \"Show advanced\" button to see all the options I listed above). I hope you will implement this, as it is a standard feature for Moodle modules and one that we rely heavily on, as I mentioned in my original post. We really love these games, so it would be a shame if we can't use them! Best, T\nComment 4: I re-read this thread, and I wonder if you misunderstood me when asking about more details. I did not mean for the module to be able to pull in different kinds of glossaries based on group membership, for example having only one instance of Games pull words from Glossary A when a member of the A group uses it and from Glossary B when a member of the B group uses it. That would be great, come to think of it, but I would happily make two instances of the Games module, just as I do now with Quizzes: Hangman for Vocabulary A (the Game module set to use Hangman and set to only be visible to group A in the course) Hangman for Vocabulary B (the Game module set to use Hangman and set to only be visible to group B in the course)\nComment 5: Hello, It's been a while since we posted the above and I was wondering if you have given any more consideration to this and if there is anything else I can provide to help in this process?\nComment 6: Now \"Group members only\" is supported both in Moodle 1.9 and 2.x\nLabel: ",

But my students all have windows computers and use IE7. So, I guess I will just not use cryptex.... thanks for your answer anyway robert\nComment 3: Before you give up, The only exposure I have to IE7 is on Vista, which in itself does some strange things.

The questions allow a feedback, the millionaire-game doesn't. Can this be enabled? It would be nice, to explain correct or wrong answers to the students.

Grade the crossword incorrectly. It will give the wrong grade. When you click on the end of crossword, it will refresh the screen, come back with some of the characters still there and some missing, and incorrect grade. We printed the puzzle before we clicked on the end of crossword puzzle and then checked it against the solution. All was correct, but the grade was not. 3. If I close the web browser, before I finish the puzzle, it will come back with characters missing. On some glossaries I close the puzzle and come back, it is just like I left it.

Is it possible this version of game left some garbage which moodle can't handle? Our moodle is 1.9.4 - I installed it just fine onto my local 1.9.1 installation months ago just fine, so has something changed? I've been through your database setup code and it seems ok... Thanks in advance, Dave\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I just installed the module Game to moodle 1.9.5 with no problem. Maybe the problem in your installation is the permission of files. Try setting the permission of all files of Game to 555 or 777. For unistall of a module go to http:// server /moodle195/admin/modules.php and not just delete the files.\nComment 2: I just remembered that the first time I installed it on our new moodle (the 1.9.4 one) I accidentally extracted the zip file as was to the mod/ folder - i.e. instead of the mod/game folder containing the mod files it contained a folder called game, which then has the files. I can't see why this would have caused the notifications handler to break though?\nComment 3: Try to copy the files of module Game to the correct position and uninstall it from the form http:// server /moodle195/admin/modules.php Test also the permissions Another idea is to try to install another module to see if you you have the same problem.\nLabel: ",

What question type do I use as a \"simple answer\" question - there is not an option for \"simple answer\" in the Quiz/Question module; What kind of multiple choice questions \"work\" with millionaire? MCMA? MCSA?) and \"use the edit button to change the games.\" After several frustrating hours of trying to figure things out with very limited instructions, I still can't get the crossword puzzle to generate more than 2 columns (regardless of how I set the parameters) I can't figure out how to set up snakes & ladders, hangman gives me incorrect answers (even though the responses in the source questions are correct) and only allows me to create 1 question per game (even though I set the parameters for more than one) and millionaire works sporadically, if at all. Can someone please direct me to better step-by-step instructions? Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: At http://bdaloukas.gr/moodle/download/game/doc/game.swf you can find a demo video. The correct is 'short answer' no 'simple answer'.

Sounds do-able - an activity module is probably what you would need.\nComment 2: Dear David Hicks, Thank you for your response. The game you reference is vs the computer. I would like to have students play each other, but propbably not live - asynchonously. There are some others online though it seems. I was thinking of using university students but perhaps even giving small cash prizes! The initial impetus for wanting this sort of functionality is because games are used in cultural psychology e.g. in the work of Yoshio Yamagishi http://www.istc.cnr.it/T3/map/cells/env-soc.html He finds that Japanese and Americans play games similarly until the strategies of other players is a secret. Then Japanese play more un-altruistically, due to lower levels of generalised trust, he argues. I thought that the protection vs. promotion mechanism \"nickel\" experiment here http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Psych407/Takeshi_april3.pdf might work well in a game theory paradigm, using instead of nickels, some sort of display of trust, like the points at ebay. It would be predicted that Americans would be motivated to increase (promote) their \"trust points\", but that Japanese would be more motivate not to allow their trust points to decrease (protection). As well as just a game with payoffs, I would really want some way of displaying a players past behaviour. But it sounds like it would cost about 3000 dollars to program. And I already have one experimental psychology module, the TUI to keep up. Tim\nComment 3: Hi Guys, I'm interested in a Game theory Module too. In fact, I'm already developing one (just making the databases conection). But I think it's a great deal to do it. I'm have a Master Degree in Applied Math and I wish I could make my students to play against each other (asynchronously or not) too. Do you like to participate? david, I send you and e-mail. Reply me. BR, Rafael Luiz Rafael dos Santos, Msc FURB - Regional University of Blumenau Brazil\nComment 4: Take a look at the Game module that I developed. It is under GPL licence. This module enables a number of games, such as hangman, crosswords and sudoku, to be played. It is translated in 8 languages. Please see the Game module documentation for more details.\nComment 5: Vasilis, Thanks for your reply. But what I'm trying to develop is a Game Theory module, using Newmann and Nash theory ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Theory ). Even though, I'll use your Ideas, as it's in GPL.

Using Moodle v1.8.3 Many thanks, Ali.\nComment 9: version 1.4.4 fixes this problem\nComment 10: Version 1.4.3, I have the same problem for a crossword. Other thing, when I delete a game, I have the message : Could not delete a game (instance)... and the game is deleted on the screen but not on the database. Thanks for the help. Patrice\nComment 11: I tried and I couldn't manage to reproduce the error. I made a new user in bdaloukas.gr/moodle with name tester to give it to you so when you manage to reproduce the error you can tell me to see it. Because I will send this password to some people please change and delete only what you inserted you. Vasilis\nComment 12: I reproduce the error on your site...\nComment 13: version 1.4.4 fixes this problem\nComment 14: Thank you, it's now working for me.\nLabel: "
