I'm supporting a school that already uses CBL in their transition to Moodle from fully offline. Besides academic competencies, students are expected to self-evaluate and then work on a couple of soft skills per semester, in alignment with the school's graduate profile. I have enabled the capabilities competency:planviewowndraft and competency:planmanageowndraft for the authenticated user role, which worked fine. However, it quickly became overwhelming since students could see all the academic frameworks. I would like to find a way to restrict students from adding academic competencies to their individual plan. I have tried the following: Setting the soft skills framework to a category and creating a new role, at the category level, with the above capabilities. This didn't work (I suspect because learning plans exist at the user level) Doing the opposite, with the academic frameworks in a category, and setting competency:competencyview to prevent. The list looks clean but students are not allowed to view their rating, proficiency, etc. If there is no other option, I'll use tours to guide them, but I'd really appreciate any ideas you might have! Thank you, Inês\nLabel: ",

When the activity from course B is completed, it would active another course C. I tried the course completion condition, but it doesn't seem to work and there is no restrict access in course completion settings. The restrict access is working for activities within course but no between two courses. I tried course completion enrolment plugin but that completely hides the course from the learner. I am on Moodle 4.3.8. Any ideas?\nLabel: ",

Not Demonstrated (any result less than 40), Demonstrated (result between 40-70), Advanced (result between 71 and 90) and Excellent( anything above 90). I understood the steps of adding the competency to the module but was not successful in automatically generating the competency when a student completed the quiz. My question is: Is it possible to automatically generate the category of the competency when a student completes the quiz? If yes, will the system update the competency when the user reattempts the quiz and gets a better mark? Any help on the steps is highly appreciated. Thanks,\nLabel: ",

I don't feel comfortable with mentioned solutions like removing some of the tables in the database and reconfiguring some moodle/competencies settings again as I wouldn't like to loose some already collected data as probably some data disappear after removal).

To give you an idea, what I am working on: We are trying to build an online learning tool for handball referees. Our idea is to have separate learning plans (LP)  for different leagues: referee - elite level referee - adults referee - juniors On the next level, we plan to have competencies (C) for different aspects of being a referee: understanding of handball - elite level leadership - elite level organisation and rules - elite level understanding of handball - adults leadership - adults organisation and rules - adults ... and so on ... And on the bottom level, we would like to have multiple courses, e.g. - understanding of handball - elite level group tactics - elite level offense - elite level defense - elite level ... and so on ... Our idea is that after completing the 3 courses (group tactics, offense, defense), the referee is awarded the competency of \"understanding handball - elite level\". And after gaining all the elite level competencies, the elite level learning plan is fulfilled and the referee can lead games on that level. However, we don't manage to get it work like this. As soon as one course is completed, the competency is awarded. I found these two forum threads: 1) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=392070 2) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=365575 Here, it sounds like this is not possible (\"each lesson may have 15-20 competencies\"). On the other hand, the Moodle FAQ says \"Can a competency be added to more than one course or activity? Definitely - and your organisation might well need to do this, if certain competencies need to be met in a series of courses or several activities within one course. \" This sounds like what we imagined. Now the question is: Is this possible? If so, which settings do we have to set to accomplish this? Or do we need to add (child) competencies for each course and parent competencies for our planned competencies (understanding of handball, leadership, etc.)? Many thanks for your help already in advance. I hope I have explained everything in sufficient detail that you can imagine what we are trying to do.\nLabel: ",

Is it OK to use the competency framework without using a learning plan? For example, I can add competencies to a course. Then link those competencies in a quiz, or graded assignment, is this a common approach? From student's perspective, when they go to the \"Competencies\" section, then they should see what competencies they are proficient in. I have not fully tested this out, but it seems to be possible. 2. Or should I be creating individual learning plans for each student to be graded for each competency I understand we can use cohort sync to assign learning plans for the entire cohort. However, it seems that that grading has to be requested from the student. Is there a way that teachers can review the competency at a certain time and manually input the grading scale for the students without getting students to request? 3. Is it possible to manually grade students for competencies? Understand that a better way is to use assignments or activities to track completion status. However, we are just starting to use Moodle, so many of our assignments, quizzes etc are not in the moodle system yet (could be paper form, or in other electronic form), so it will take some time to import all assignments into Moodle. Before we get to the state where everything is handled in moodle, is there a way to manually and easily assign the competency grade to the students? Thanks, David\nLabel: ",

But I would like most of this work to be automated. So here is what I am looking for. According to local requirements, we have to rate competencies at four levels - which is not a problem to set up. However, in our courses we use a lot of automatically graded activities (or even assignments). But at the moment I don't see any way how I can automatically assign a student a high level of competency who has done very well in one of these activities, and a low level of competency to a student who has done less well. Doing that by hand is not only tedious (you don't see the points of an assignment or quiz in the competency overview, but also prone to error. And I don't really see the point of copying/replicating digitally available information by hand within the same system. The second problem I have: Some acitivities (rich in pedagogical content) are linked to several competencies, but as far as I see I can't award one of several competencies automatically whereas another one is just used as reverance. All these problems are in stark contrast to the fine grained possibilities when restricting activities depending on prior achievements Moodle already provides. That's why I want to ask whether there ary any plans to make the whole compentency framework more flexible? That would certainly save teachers a lot of time and frustration with teadious paper work. In case my conception of the possibilities and limitations of competencies are wrong, I'm more than happy to stand corrected.\nLabel: ",

Still trying to understand if this is possible in Moodle, basically, in my head i'd create a Learning Plan for each Job Role, then many different courses that grant Competencies. My question would be, once i have the users enrolled to the courses that they need to complete, (this should be done by Learning plans, correct?), how do i view their progress towards completion of either the learning plan or the competency framework? Is there a bird's eye view of all the competencies by that user, that HR can go and see? And inversely, is there a bird's eye view of all the users that have succeeded in that Learning Plan? Bonus points for seeing all users that have that learning plan associated, but something missing to complete it Sorry if these questions are basic, i feel lost in the documentation and moodle isn't helping - i've reinstalled several times for problems due to competencies. (Mostly, can't remove them even though they aren't linked to anything anymore) Thanks in advance for any input\nLabel: ",

Can we set up a Moodle site that is fully /mainly based on competency based learning/courses and how would it look like.? I'm not completely happy with my results, but it will be possible that I've overseen some options. But lets start at the beginning. We can create site wide or category related competency frameworks. A competency framework bundles several competencies and brings them into a hierachical order. Competency rules allows to defines rules that a user gets a top level competency if one or many other comptencies are met. Acitivity or course completion can be connected with one or many competencies. Its possible to connect the same competence in different courses. A participant can be enrolled into a learning plan. The user sees the learning plans and progress in the dashboard . When a learning plan is created  competencies are connected to the learning plan. Participants are enrolled to the learning plan via cohorts. Is it also possible for single learners? Its possible to define different levels of competencies. I.e. basic, standard, expert. How can we use it in a typical learning environment? For each learning topic and class level a competency framework is cretaed. They are connected to typical learning plans. At school it could be Class 8 English as a second language competency framework. Each teacher has an own classroom for each class in the term. He creates learning activties and connects them with competencies. Each students is connected with a learning plan (i.e. ESL class 8) The student can see the progress in dashboard. This model will work. But there are several issues I'm not happy with.: There are competencies that are not related to one topic only. (i.e. Presentation competency is an issue in German schools in class 8/9 in most topics for this class level). If each teacher adds activities for this competency students have to do  the same/similar very often and teacher don't see the progress/successs from other topics. As long as we have class and topic related courses teachers are isolated and everyone creates individual ressources, avctivities and didactical concepts. Cooperation and collaboration of teachers at schools are not part of their mindest (mostly here in Germany). So ist a lot of effort to create courses. This stops teacher to use a LMS intensive. Let me try to discuss an alternative model. Competency frameworks and learning plans are edited on site/category level. Courses are created for competencies not for classes. Instead of typical class and topic courses we create competency related courses. Its possible that for each competency several courses are available and the students enrolls themself. There are furthermore class/topic related courses. But the intention is different than typical. They are used for communication, some collaborative activities and final exam preparation. The student sees an overview about progress in the dashboard. This model tries  to push teachers to work collaborative and to use didactical scenarios from other teachers teaching the same topic. In some cases this could be  a little bit to radical/revolutionary. If this is your reality you can use the competency based courses as template and import them  into class related courses. I didn't check whether course related competency connections are included in backups.) What is missing? What I could not realize.... How can a teacher see the individual progress for a student? How can a teacher grade, comment the students activities? How can we limit the teachers access to his own students in the competency based courses? How can we implement didactical scenarios that needs group work? I also tried to understand how we can use taxonomies. After discussion with Mary we came to the result taxonomies are only descriptions. They are not related to any function.  Is this correct? Who can see the taxonomies? What do you think?

In our use case, doing the whole course isn't always required, so students could pick and choose to be proficient in the competencies (and their corresponding activities) relating only to their learning plan. MDL-53346 would help resolve this somewhat bit I was wondering if anyone has a workaround that I may have missed? Short of getting the student to write down all the competencies required to complete a learning plan and then visiting the course competencies page to see which activities to do, the connection between a learning plan and a competency isn't sufficiently clear for students.\nLabel: ",

The initial logic with those two features is that by connecting them with courses you can define which course will help a particular employee build up his competency level or in general develop a competency level. And that is ok. But the thing I want to do with this is that based on the employee's competencies (organization skills, communications skills, IT knowledge...) he can see or be assigned to a particular course. So if the guy is an IT specialist when he signs into our Moodle page, he'll automatically see only courses that correspond with his roles and competencies, and of course, he can then choose if he wants to roll in. I assume this is Role connected, so can somebody suggest how to best approach this? Thank you in advance.\nLabel: ",

If they answer all (4) questions correctly, then the maximum they will be able to reach is the second level of the scale (out of 6). What have I done? In the lesson, the grade is set to 'scale' (with maximum grade of 6) Grade to pass = 2.0 One competency was assigned to 'course competencies' Each correct answer yields 0.5 points of the grade What happens? When the learner answers all 4 questions correctly, he reaches the maximum of the scale (6), not the second (2). Can someone help me achieve the objective that I had set? Thanks !!\nLabel: ",

MOODLE v3.2 - Competence Frameworks, I am creating a framework at site level (we have no defined standard internationally or nationally).  I have my 5 top level competencies, and I am breaking them down into smaller chunks against which activities will be judged. What I want to know, is at what level I should be defining, or breaking down the competencies into performance criteria at the framework level  and where I I stop and then have the remainder defined within a course.   This is hard to explain. For example, if I have a top level competence, say COMMUNICATE then that is one of the top level competence elements in the framework.   Then say I am testing communication in terms of written and oral.  So I have two subcompetencies COMMUNICATE - written and COMMUNICATE- oral.  Then the written communication requires that the people use the correct systems or technology, use appropriate language, and, say, cover the right material.  Should those three sub-sub-competencies be in the framework, or in the course? Is there any kind of standard that anyone knows of? Many thanks for any thoughts, or any advice on where else this kind of topic is discussed, I know it isn't really to do with moodle, moodle is just the tool, but I figured someone here might have hit this problem before me!

Sure, I can set up a SQL request and update the table competency_usercomp, field grade from 2 to 3 for example, but this would be better if we had  that option in Moodle ;>)) It may be then a cron update...\nLabel: ",

I'm supporting a school that already uses CBL in their transition to Moodle from fully offline. Besides academic competencies, students are expected to self-evaluate and then work on a couple of soft skills per semester, in alignment with the school's graduate profile. I have enabled the capabilities competency:planviewowndraft and competency:planmanageowndraft for the authenticated user role, which worked fine. However, it quickly became overwhelming since students could see all the academic frameworks. I would like to find a way to restrict students from adding academic competencies to their individual plan. I have tried the following: Setting the soft skills framework to a category and creating a new role, at the category level, with the above capabilities. This didn't work (I suspect because learning plans exist at the user level) Doing the opposite, with the academic frameworks in a category, and setting competency:competencyview to prevent. The list looks clean but students are not allowed to view their rating, proficiency, etc. If there is no other option, I'll use tours to guide them, but I'd really appreciate any ideas you might have! Thank you, Inês\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I turned off all of those capabilities because we didn't want our student creating their own competencies, but I believe if you want to \"hide\" the competencies from the students just change the visible flag, to No. The admins can still see the competencies, but the students do not. You would need to test if other roles, Teachers/graders whatever you use in your organization who work with creating/editing competencies can still see the competencies. The top tier competency is the only one you would need to change (I know, easy to say I have 100+ top tiers....).\nLabel: ",

So, I would like the students to be able to see the marks they have obtained for each specific competency but also the mark for each level to which different competencies belong. I don't know if I explained myself, I hope so. Thank you very much Francesc\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: You should setup a small test competency and link it to a course activity, to see if this would even work for you. I cannot envision how an administrator or instructor would select the various taxonomy levels when manually rating a competency.\nComment 2: First of all thanks for your answer, Shirley I meant we assigned different activities to each competency. A small group of this competencies belong to the taxonomy level Skills-1, as other groups belong to Skills-2. The rate's average of the competencies will give a rate for each Skill. And Skills are in the taxonomy level of «Indicators». Then a group of Skills belong to Indicator-1, other group of Skills to Indicator-2,... The rate average of the Skills they belong to the same Indicator give me the rate for this Indicator,... Then different Indicators are in the Domain taxonomy level,... Finally, I have rate for each competency and for each group of each level they belong. For example: Domain 1 Indicator 1\nComment 3: Are you linking the competencies to course activities - or just to the student's learning plans?\nComment 4: I am linking competencies to course activities, but I would like to see the \"Competency Grade Report\" as I wrote in the last post, with the rate for each level the competencies belong to, in addition to the grade for each competency. Is this possible? Thank you Francesc\nComment 5: not possible. - the functionality for grades to competencies does not exist - It might have been on the Roadmap, but all things related to Competencies and learning plans was removed a few months back. Competencies and learning plans are just another way for providing grade information to a student, since Moodle does not have great reporting for competencies and learning plans have you considered using Grade Letters, scales https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Scales and feedback? There is much better \"out of the box\" reporting.\nComment 6: I meant rate not grade, I'm sorry. I would like to have on the competencies assessment page, the rate for each competency individually and for each level of taxonomy they belong. Is this what isn't possible? Thanks for your answers. Francesc\nComment 7: not that I know of - I use the Monitoring of Learning Plans plugin - but even with that I do not believe you can drill down into the taxonomy levels. I have never tried - you really have to set it up and see what it looks like. You will however, have to manually rate each competency for each student - there will be no automation. https://moodle.org/plugins/report_lpmonitointring\nComment 8: Thank you very much Shirley, I didn't know this plugin. The feature below in your link say: « New features for lpmonitoring v1.4 Summary tab It shows ratings in courses in a summarized table display for scale values, where competencies are grouped by parent competency, » This is very similar what I was looking for.

It would be great as well to have some kind of notification for a student that the deadline is approaching (as for now I did not find a settings about learning plans notification. There are notifications about courses, activities , etc. but the student can miss/not enroll to the course at all). Unfortunately for me, one of the available plugins which is very popular and recommended ( Monitoring of Learning Plans - report_lpmonitoring ) is not supported in Moodle 4.0 (I tried to install it and I had some issues, similarly to other persons on higher Moodle versions than 3.8 or so. I don't feel comfortable with mentioned solutions like removing some of the tables in the database and reconfiguring some moodle/competencies settings again as I wouldn't like to loose some already collected data as probably some data disappear after removal). It looks that I must base on the official features (or any other plugins, but I'm not aware about them). May I count on any hints from more experienced users?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Learning plans and competencies are neglected objects in Moodle. Very few plug-in exists and more of my reports is via ad-hoc contributed reports with some adjustments. I use the Monitoring of Learning Plans plug-in, but I am on 3.11.6 and have no issues. The learning plan objects have the functionality to set a due date, but since these dates are not relative dates they are unusable for my use case. Kind Regards\nComment 2: Hi Shirley, sorry for a pretty late response. Thank you for beeing here and providing great support. It is a great value for me. Going back to the thread: I would love to use the Monitoring of LP plugin, but as I mentioned there are some issues during the installation phase and after looking for any solution I found out that one solution is to manually removing some mySQL tables and recreating them again (somehow ;) ). Sadly it is not my level of tech expertise. When it comes to due dates / deadlines - it looks that it will not solve my case, similarly as your case (I need to define a relative time for gaining all needed competencies, something like \"three months from ascribing of LP\", or \"in 12 weeks\" or so).\nComment 3: The UI for Learning Plans and Competencies has been largely ignored. In Moodle Tracker consider voting for issues that you believe have value to fixing the Learning Plan/Competency shortcomings. MDL-69237 Link a competency to multiple learning plan templates MDL-62551 - Add a leading checkbox in every competency line in the add competency to course/learning plan template pages MDL-57749 - Allow moving a competency framework to a different category or site MDL-69063 - Turn off Request Review feature for competencies MDL-59865 - Learning Plan Expiry MDL-37931 - Grades Overview Report (the last one is not for LPs, but I still believe it has merit) Additionally, the forum where discussions regard LP/Competency might get some traction is the Moodle UX discussions https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=8698 forum.

To give you an idea, what I am working on: We are trying to build an online learning tool for handball referees. Our idea is to have separate learning plans (LP)  for different leagues: referee - elite level referee - adults referee - juniors On the next level, we plan to have competencies (C) for different aspects of being a referee: understanding of handball - elite level leadership - elite level organisation and rules - elite level understanding of handball - adults leadership - adults organisation and rules - adults ... and so on ... And on the bottom level, we would like to have multiple courses, e.g. - understanding of handball - elite level group tactics - elite level offense - elite level defense - elite level ... and so on ... Our idea is that after completing the 3 courses (group tactics, offense, defense), the referee is awarded the competency of \"understanding handball - elite level\". And after gaining all the elite level competencies, the elite level learning plan is fulfilled and the referee can lead games on that level. However, we don't manage to get it work like this. As soon as one course is completed, the competency is awarded. I found these two forum threads: 1) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=392070 2) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=365575 Here, it sounds like this is not possible (\"each lesson may have 15-20 competencies\"). On the other hand, the Moodle FAQ says \"Can a competency be added to more than one course or activity? Definitely - and your organisation might well need to do this, if certain competencies need to be met in a series of courses or several activities within one course. \" This sounds like what we imagined. Now the question is: Is this possible? If so, which settings do we have to set to accomplish this? Or do we need to add (child) competencies for each course and parent competencies for our planned competencies (understanding of handball, leadership, etc.)? Many thanks for your help already in advance. I hope I have explained everything in sufficient detail that you can imagine what we are trying to do.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: If you use the restrict access condition on your courses, so that the students must complete all courses in sequence, the competencies can be awarded on the last completed courses.

Is it OK to use the competency framework without using a learning plan? For example, I can add competencies to a course. Then link those competencies in a quiz, or graded assignment, is this a common approach? From student's perspective, when they go to the \"Competencies\" section, then they should see what competencies they are proficient in. I have not fully tested this out, but it seems to be possible. 2. Or should I be creating individual learning plans for each student to be graded for each competency I understand we can use cohort sync to assign learning plans for the entire cohort. However, it seems that that grading has to be requested from the student. Is there a way that teachers can review the competency at a certain time and manually input the grading scale for the students without getting students to request? 3. Is it possible to manually grade students for competencies? Understand that a better way is to use assignments or activities to track completion status. However, we are just starting to use Moodle, so many of our assignments, quizzes etc are not in the moodle system yet (could be paper form, or in other electronic form), so it will take some time to import all assignments into Moodle. Before we get to the state where everything is handled in moodle, is there a way to manually and easily assign the competency grade to the students? Thanks, David\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello David, 1. Competencies must have a relationship to a student's Learning Plan in order to display the student's competencies. The object being viewed is the Student's Learning Plan. 2. Normally, you create a Learning Plan Template and then add in all of the competencies for that learning plan. Each student may have a unique learning plan template or you could create learning plan templates that are common goals that all students in that area of study must achieve. 2a. Cohort Sync to learning plans will automatically link student's that are members of a cohort to a specific learning plan. Cohorts are mainly used to automate course enrollments. 2b. When a competency is related to a course activity the administrator can choose to either automatically award the competency to the student or have the activity manually rated by a teacher. The student will not be awarded the competency until the teacher rates it. I would only recommend manual rating for Essay or complex assignments. 3. Competencies are not grades. Competencies are an alternate method of tracking achievement. Please note the core Moodle structure does not have standard reports on Learning plans and student competencies. The UI for working with competencies and learning plans frameworks are very unforgiving. There are many past post in the forum that you could poke around and look at to provide you with a sense of the challenges if you decide to use competencies and learning plans.\nComment 2: To address number 1) \"Is it OK to use the competency framework without using a learning plan?\" The answer is yes, if what you are primarily interested in is course alignment with standards for use in reporting, course design, accreditation, etc. Course competency frameworks are a very valuable source of information for helping with course design and standards alignment all in itself. For some institutions, this is all that what they currently need and may not yet be focused on or desirous of implementing the Learning Plans: they are focused on the course design phase. Also, I have seen a definite benefit in cases where an organization may not have experience with competency based learning models: they can use the frameworks to understand how those work. It is very valuable as the first step if you are not used to working in a competency based model. You can always progress later to add Learning Plans: but if you don't have the right set up for your frameworks to start with, and sufficiently well designed courses that align to the standards, it will probably be a less effective (and more confusing) if you rush into it.\nComment 3: Hi Randy, Shirley Thank you very much for your response To test this out, I have added some competencies to a course and tagged an assignment activity to these competencies with the option \"Send for review\" upon activity completion. When I log in as a student, on the Student View > Competencies, there is a \"You are proficient in 0 out of 8 competencies in this course\" message. However, after the student has submitted the assignment, and received a grade, the above is still 0 out of 8. What does the student need to do to have the proficiency tagged as 8 out of 8 proficiencies?\nComment 4: [EDIT] I figured out how to change the proficiency here, just to share, hopefully, it helps somebody else figuring out this issue down the road In the Course > Edit Settings > More > Reports > Competency Breakdown There is a screen where all the competencies are listed, and you can Rate each student's competency based on the pre-defined scale. When this is updated, from the student view, when they view competency, the status will change. This fits my current scenario where my assignments etc are not fully configured for competency ratings yet, as it gives us a way to rate the child's competency manually at the end of each semester.\nComment 5: Excellent that works for your use case. I do not use the Competency Breakdown report , as it has limited functionality. My students need to see their entire Learning Plan and their current progress. Kind Regards\nLabel: ",

However, in our courses we use a lot of automatically graded activities (or even assignments). But at the moment I don't see any way how I can automatically assign a student a high level of competency who has done very well in one of these activities, and a low level of competency to a student who has done less well. Doing that by hand is not only tedious (you don't see the points of an assignment or quiz in the competency overview, but also prone to error. And I don't really see the point of copying/replicating digitally available information by hand within the same system. The second problem I have: Some acitivities (rich in pedagogical content) are linked to several competencies, but as far as I see I can't award one of several competencies automatically whereas another one is just used as reverance. All these problems are in stark contrast to the fine grained possibilities when restricting activities depending on prior achievements Moodle already provides. That's why I want to ask whether there ary any plans to make the whole compentency framework more flexible? That would certainly save teachers a lot of time and frustration with teadious paper work. In case my conception of the possibilities and limitations of competencies are wrong, I'm more than happy to stand corrected.\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

I apologize if this is a stupid question. I have scoured the internet and looked high and low for this but with no luck. So, what is the difference between competencies and activity completion? We are doing training for teachers and then have a set of activities that need to be completed and then they can move onto the next. If they are doing anything with the leader, it will be through SharePoint. So is there any worth in setting up competencies? Thank you!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: 'Hi all! I apologize if this is a stupid question.' It's an excellent question, but I am not the right person to answer it. However In my view Activity completion is much easier to understand and use than Competencies, but they are not really interchangeable things.\nComment 2: Competencies and learning plans are a whole separate system of tracking a students achievements. There is a lot of manually setup and upkeep and no delivered reports within Moodle. It is a necessary evil, for what I need to track - if it was not a requirement - I would just use the activity completion and Grades reports to evaluate if the training objectives were met. Within this forum - you can find some good data to support not going down that path. Kind Regards\nComment 3: @Shirley and @Marcus, thank you so much for the feedback. I thought that it was more work than needed but I think I wanted some confirmation. For more data to support this, are there certain forums on here? Thank you!\nLabel: ",

Many thanks Andrew\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: You cannot change the scales after a competency has been awarded to a student.

Still trying to understand if this is possible in Moodle, basically, in my head i'd create a Learning Plan for each Job Role, then many different courses that grant Competencies. My question would be, once i have the users enrolled to the courses that they need to complete, (this should be done by Learning plans, correct?), how do i view their progress towards completion of either the learning plan or the competency framework? Is there a bird's eye view of all the competencies by that user, that HR can go and see? And inversely, is there a bird's eye view of all the users that have succeeded in that Learning Plan? Bonus points for seeing all users that have that learning plan associated, but something missing to complete it Sorry if these questions are basic, i feel lost in the documentation and moodle isn't helping - i've reinstalled several times for problems due to competencies. (Mostly, can't remove them even though they aren't linked to anything anymore) Thanks in advance for any input\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I use this plugin-in Monitoring of Learning Plans. https://moodle.org/plugins/report_lpmonitointring Excellent visualization of the learning plan. Unfortunately, there are no Moodle core reports on anything to support learning plans, competency frameworks or learning plan templates. There is no way to report on all students with a single competency. If you have large populations of students (employees) with a few students in each learning plan is it challenging to administrate. Please vote for this tracker issue if you plan on managing large groups of competencies and learning plans - MDL-69237\nComment 2: Hello, we're still in the planning stage so i'd love to hear some suggestions! If i understood you correctly, your opinion is that my needs would be better served with just using courses? So basically, i would create a course instead of a learning plan, in which the student gets 'trained' in a particular job role? In this way, would HR be able to have a user that will 'see' all the courses completed by the student (and possibly, what grade?) Thanks!\nComment 3: Learning plan 10,000 ft view 1. Competencies are created in the competency framework 2. Learning plan template are created with the desired competencies. 3. Student are assigned a learning plan which becomes their learning plan 4. Course are created that award the competency at a course activity. These are designed to be viewed by the student/Employee - it may be possible to allow manager/instructors to see this view but this takes changes to roles/permissions. Moodle core has no manager, instructor view - I use the plugin I mentioned above to achieve this. Courses - a. Courses contain content and/or activities that students (employees) must complete. You can set passing conditions such as a grade. b.Moodle has standardized core reports for course activity completion and course completion. c. All students who are enrolled in the course - current status and date they achieved the completion status. d. Students who successfully complete a course can achieve the competency which can be rated (automatic or manually). You should research some of the posting in this forum to see the issues that have come up - You should research the available Moodle documentation for competencies, learning plans, scales Maybe start here - https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Competencies\nLabel: ",

For example, Programming Knowledge (Competency) Java (skill) Javascript (skill) Angular (skill) Now, my question is Can I meet this requirement directly with Moodle now? Ideally, I should be able to add Programming Knowledge to the learning plan, and when the manager clicking on the review button, it should show the skills linked to the competency, and allow rating the skills. and if the skills are met, competency should be considered proficient. Is that possible? Regards, Jack\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: If I understand this correctly, you want to use the Programming Knowledge (PK) as the parent competency. The Java, JavaScript and Angular skills are children of PK. 1. taxonomy is at the highest level of the competency structure. In your use case PK.

When we get a new employee, I want to assign them something like a learning plan so they are batch enrolled in all the courses in the learning plan. First of all, is this how learning plans work? Creating learning plans requires creating competencies first, but I not sure how to organize the competencies. Here is the idea, tell me how I should configure this in Moodle. I really appreciate your help! For example, I have dinner chefs and bakers. Both jobs require Food Safety training. Only Chefs need Chicken Training. Only bakers need Frosting Training.  Chefs require Basic Oven training. Bakers require Advanced Oven training. Competency Framework: Oven Competencies: Basic Oven, Advanced Oven Competency Framework: Food Safety Competencies: Clean surfaces, Safe Temperature Competency Framework: Chicken Competencies: Deboning, Marinating Competency Framework: Frosting Competencies: Mixing, Spreading Learning Plan: Chef Competencies: all in frameworks Food Safety, Chicken, Advanced Oven Chef is assigned the Chef Learning plan, which enrolls her in all courses marked with the competencies Food Safety, Chicken, and Basic Oven. Learning Plan: Baker Competencies: all in frameworks Food Safety, Frosting, Advanced Oven Baker is assigned the Baker learning plan, which enrolls her in all courses marked with competencies Food Safety, Frosting, and Advanced Oven. Am I on the right track?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Tennille, Competency Based Training as you explained needs to be made more task related and specific. Competency :-Basic Oven is insufficient as it would not allow the proper assessment. A simple approach can be to divide the task into three i.e. the pre activities , the activity and the post activity. What are the skills required for the task that relates  to the oven? Identify these in order. An oven is useful for baking or broiling:- Possible Pre-task:- Appropriate preparation of the oven:- 1. check the oven shelves (this determines quality) 2. presetting of the temperature gauge. 3. appropriate setting of the temperature gauge. (The difference between 2 and 3 is that it can be set but it was too high or too low.) Task:- 4. Proper placing of the chicken in the oven (for proper circulation of heat) 5. Sufficient baking time 6. Checking of product during baking. Post task:- 7 Turning oven off 8. Placing product in an appropriate place Check online, help can be found there. \"Type competencies training  for bakers\". I hope that you would be able to set up your plan. Best of luck Jemima\nComment 2: Competency Frameworks do not have to mirror your Learning Plans Template (Framework). Competencies from any framework can be added to a Learning Plan Template. You could have one large framework or hundreds. Note: once you setup a framework you cannot move the competency to another framework. Consider how your administrators will use these objects before you setup your framework(s). If you have one large framework, you can relocate a competency within the single framework. IMHO - I would create Food Safety as the top, Parent. I would create under Food, Chicken, Frosting, Chef, Baker. Under Chicken - deboning, Marinating. Before you can build your competencies frameworks, you have to consider scales. Scales cannot be changes once a student (employee) has been awarded the competency. We are using the Monitoring of Learning Plans plugin, which is more visual than the core design. Consider how you will use the competencies and learning plans. For Food Safety each employee will probably have to requalify annually or bi-annually. The competency objects have no end date, they never expire. Learning plans assigned to employees have no end-dates, they never expire. Deleting them removes the training history that you will need to retain for FDA. Kind Regards\nComment 3: Thank you for the informative answer. I wish we could use plugins, but we are using Moodle Cloud so we don't appear to have permissions to install them. I apologize that my example diluted the original question, which was: Is there a way to assign a student to [Moodle feature] which batch enrolls them in multiple relevant preselected courses?\nComment 4: You might try cohorts, I use them. However, I manual build them vs the upload functionality as the instructions to do them is not completely intuitive. You may want to search the Enrollments forum, there have been some recent posting about cohort uploads. Kind Regards\nComment 5: Cohorts seem great for enrolling many people to one course; what if you want to enroll one person into many courses?\nComment 6: Most of my students are members of many cohorts. Some cohorts are course based some cohorts are based on the student's position in the organization. Works well, no issues - I just need to work with the upload functionality in a test course, to get the process down and get comfortable with it.\nLabel: ",

Or a higher ability student only able to access higher ability content within a course based on the competency associated with it?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I do not believe that is possible. Course restriction rules are based on activities or grades. Competencies are awarded after the successful completion of an activity or passing grade. We currently do not have any restrictions if a competency is not achieved. IMHO I would create two separate courses and enroll the students to the appropriate course. I would also consider the lower level course a perquisite to the higher level course. Kind regards\nLabel: ",

If I set up an updated competency framework and migrated the competencies in the courses to the new framework, what will happen to the learning plans, assuming that there are already students with progress?

I don't think that's included? Thanks to whoever will respond.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Why are you considering updating the competency framework? The students do not see the structure, the framework is only there for administrators of the structure. We have to live with what we created. Learning plans are within their own framework and it does not matter with the competencies are. The competencies linked to courses do not \"care\" where the competency is.\nLabel: ",

If they are in fact marked competent (or passed), it shows green, like it should.\nComment 3: Competencies that are auto-awarded by activity completion work best with Scales = Competent, Completed, Proficient. One single value. Students who did not complete the activity are displayed as NOT RATED. My learning experience is to only create Scales with the single value - unfortunately this cannot be corrected. Scales cannot be changed after they are awarded, even if the one value is never awarded to a Student. Scales are very unforgiving. Competency that are manually rated by the Instructor can have multiple values for the Scale = Expert, Accomplished, Good, Fair, Needs Additional Effort.

Thank you in advance!!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: As soon as the activity is completed the competency is awarded. The \"workaround\" to your use case, would be to have a single course, with two activities and the students needs to complete/pass both activity to be awarded to competency. Courses are shells that may contain multiple activities before a student earn competency.\nComment 2: Thank you! I suppose I could also just create sub-competencies for each course or require one course to have the other completed first. I appreciate your help.\nComment 3: The parent-child relationships in the competency frameworks did not work as I expected and I abandoned those. Working with large competency structures (I have courses that award 18-20 competencies). in learning plans are cumbersome. Good Luck!\nComment 4: Aaron, An alternative that may help is the Subcourse plugin: https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_subcourse . It's an activity that pulls in the final grade of another course into the course it is in. Since it is an activity it can have its own competency and do what Shirley suggested.

I have set upon activity completion to 'complete the competency'; I have set the Activity Completion to ' Show activity as complete when ... student receives a grade'. When the student is graded only the first of the competencies is shown to be a 'pass' in the Course Competencies page. Both show the link to the assignment OK. In the learning plan, it identifies that first competency as being met but not the second. I have tried linking the two competencies in the framework but that makes no difference. Please could you advise what I may be doing that is wrong? I am in Moodle 3.5.6+ Cheers Barbara\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Did you set up the two competencies are a parent-child relationship in the competency framework? If so, remove that relationship and simply add the second (former child) relationship to the course competency and then to the activity. If you did not use the parent-child relationship then screen captures would help.\nComment 2: Many thanks for the swift reply. That does the job many thanks I am still confused regarding the options of which of the \"Upon Course completion: Do nothing/attach evidence/complete the competency\" boxes should be used as there are two; one on the competency page - when setting up in the course and then also on the assignment setup. Does one take precedence over the other; I have not noticed that if one is set up then the other follows suit. At the moment I am setting both but does seem duplication of effort. Sorry if something obvious I am missing here! Mank Barbara\nComment 3: The options for awarding a competency Do Nothing (the instructor will manually rate this and award the competency) this is needed is you have various skill levels. Such as Expert, Advanced, Skills, Basic Understand, Improvement is needed. Attach Evidence, the instructor will manually rate this and award the competency after they review the attached evidence. If you are using the Assignment Course Activity this may be redundant...... Complete the Competency automatically awards the competency based on the related - course activity - completion rules.\nComment 4: Hi Shirley Many thanks, I think my query was on the duplication, in the assignment edit settings, and then again on the competency page for the course and whether either has precedence; or whether it's just a case of making sure both are set to the same requirement.\nComment 5: We are having the same issue, anything from the one framework marks as completed but the next framework everything shows as Not yet competent. The two frameworks have been set up using the same settings. What is also odd is when the user looks at their competencies, those from Framework 1 don't say anything when they haven't been completed yet competencies from Framework 2 show as Not yet competent.\nComment 6: look at the Proficiency default values. The competency that is awarding the Not yet competent value - may have that as the default. Which would indicate that an instructor will need to change that Rating manually. Was that the intent of the Course/Competency set-up?\nLabel: ",

How to Manage Stress Working with others Time Management In Moodle from the student's Learning Plan page, they can select the Add New Learning Plan button and then add competencies directly from the competency framework. not something I would allow corporate learners.....but maybe other businesses don't have issues with this. For each competency, the student's would need to be able to either \"request enrollment\" or self-enroll.\nComment 2: Hi Shirley let me describe the scenarios I've in my mind. In lots of industries  we can see a discussion about agile corporate mindsets and structures.  The is has massive consequences for L&D.  Typical L&D programs will run decentral and lots will be adhoc training offers and self organized trainings. The general expection for an employee is that s/he start activities and organizes learning  acitivities by self. If an employeee is interested in personal growth, getting new skills and competencies s/he should be able to identify  a learning plan and to enrole. I expect that we will have much less open central programs, much more decentral initiatives that are started  just a few weeks after identifying the need, working out loud circles und individuals that start their own journey. The role of an LMS will change in a  VUCA world. Ralf\nComment 3: Hi Shirley, I saw the mention \"add new learning plan button\" in your post. I am trying to get student to propose their own learning plan but even if I give permission to planviewowndraft and planmangedraft as Mary Cooch suggested, I can't find a way to make it works. How did you make it works? Thanks Simon\nComment 4: I do not use that piece of functionality. You would have to allow the students to select which competencies to add to their learning plans. If the UI allowed for a better way to structure the competency framework and to inactivate competencies that were no longer valid, this would be a great way to build development plans for students. The current UI design for the framework and the competency objects - makes this too challenging because it lacks the controls needed to allow for self creation of a Learning Plan.\nLabel: ",

In my scenario I tried it with course completion criteria. The student should get the comptency if the course is completed. I added the competency  criteria only on course level, but not for the activity. I expected when I do it on activity level that only the activity gives the student access to the competency. On course level the setting is made to complete. I will try it today with activity and check whether the  result is different.

Can we set up a Moodle site that is fully /mainly based on competency based learning/courses and how would it look like.? I'm not completely happy with my results, but it will be possible that I've overseen some options. But lets start at the beginning. We can create site wide or category related competency frameworks. A competency framework bundles several competencies and brings them into a hierachical order. Competency rules allows to defines rules that a user gets a top level competency if one or many other comptencies are met. Acitivity or course completion can be connected with one or many competencies. Its possible to connect the same competence in different courses. A participant can be enrolled into a learning plan. The user sees the learning plans and progress in the dashboard . When a learning plan is created  competencies are connected to the learning plan. Participants are enrolled to the learning plan via cohorts. Is it also possible for single learners? Its possible to define different levels of competencies. I.e. basic, standard, expert. How can we use it in a typical learning environment? For each learning topic and class level a competency framework is cretaed. They are connected to typical learning plans. At school it could be Class 8 English as a second language competency framework. Each teacher has an own classroom for each class in the term. He creates learning activties and connects them with competencies. Each students is connected with a learning plan (i.e. ESL class 8) The student can see the progress in dashboard. This model will work. But there are several issues I'm not happy with.: There are competencies that are not related to one topic only. (i.e. Presentation competency is an issue in German schools in class 8/9 in most topics for this class level). If each teacher adds activities for this competency students have to do  the same/similar very often and teacher don't see the progress/successs from other topics. As long as we have class and topic related courses teachers are isolated and everyone creates individual ressources, avctivities and didactical concepts. Cooperation and collaboration of teachers at schools are not part of their mindest (mostly here in Germany). So ist a lot of effort to create courses. This stops teacher to use a LMS intensive. Let me try to discuss an alternative model. Competency frameworks and learning plans are edited on site/category level. Courses are created for competencies not for classes. Instead of typical class and topic courses we create competency related courses. Its possible that for each competency several courses are available and the students enrolls themself. There are furthermore class/topic related courses. But the intention is different than typical. They are used for communication, some collaborative activities and final exam preparation. The student sees an overview about progress in the dashboard. This model tries  to push teachers to work collaborative and to use didactical scenarios from other teachers teaching the same topic. In some cases this could be  a little bit to radical/revolutionary. If this is your reality you can use the competency based courses as template and import them  into class related courses. I didn't check whether course related competency connections are included in backups.) What is missing? What I could not realize.... How can a teacher see the individual progress for a student? How can a teacher grade, comment the students activities? How can we limit the teachers access to his own students in the competency based courses? How can we implement didactical scenarios that needs group work? I also tried to understand how we can use taxonomies. After discussion with Mary we came to the result taxonomies are only descriptions. They are not related to any function.  Is this correct? Who can see the taxonomies? What do you think? Ralf This post was originally made in German community for didactical scenarios. https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=380558\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Ralf, Thank you for a well written use case. Competencies, Learning Plan (student level) and the Learning Plan Templates need additional UI functionality to make them truly usable. The current UI displays, were not intended for hundreds of competencies and learning plans that a corporation/or adult training programs require. Cannot move structures - Learning plans, competency frameworks, learning plan templates. Cannot link parent competency to a learning plan, and have all children related to the learning plan. Cannot Search the learning plan templates The current UI does not include  the functionality for students that require annual retraining to \"retain\" their current competency level or to improve on their current competency level. Functionality to set a competency framework, learning plan template or learning plan to \"inactive\" to retain the history of the objects and relationships. Deleting removes the history. Completion of a students learning plans to remove make it inactive is inappropriate, but it is the only option. Need the ability to \"grandfather\" a student for a competency and enter the dates of achievement. Students in the corporate world complete training outside of the LMS - and administrators often are provided evidence long after the course was completed. The taxonomies should be been at a system configuration level vs. the individual competency framework. These are just the thoughts off the top of my head.\nComment 2: Thankyou Shirley for your post - some responses to points you raised are below: \n```text\nCannot link parent competency to a learning plan, and have all children related to the learning plan.\n```\n When selecting a competencies, the competencies are displayed in an accessible tree which has some keyboard shortcuts that might help. '*' key expands all nodes in the tree 'shift' click will select all nodes in between two points in the tree. So you can quickly select all nodes in any branch of the tree. \n```text\n\"The taxonomies should be been at a system configuration level vs. the individual competency framework.\"\n```\n The framework defines what the taxonomy should be and changing the taxonomy for one framework should not affect other ones. \n```text\nFunctionality to set a competency framework, learning plan template or learning plan to \"inactive\" to retain the history of the objects and relationships.\n```\n This does exist already - when a new version of a framework is created, the old one can be set to not \"visible\" which retains and will show the history of objects and relationships, but will prevent the competencies in the \"old framework\" from being selectable\nwhen adding competencies to a course / learning plans etc. There is then also the Migrate Frameworks tool to update all the competencies in courses from the old framework to the new one.\nComment 3: Thank you for your response. I was not totally clear on why the current competency to Learning Plan relationships are challenging in a corporate environment. The corporate learning world goes through business changes that obsolete, rename and reorganize data structures frequently. Selecting all of the children in the tree view quickly, is not an issue. Sequencing them by the ID vs. manually moving them one-by-one, like the course category would be the desired functionality. Setting framework to not visible (hide), did not remove the learning plan from the student's view during my initial testing. Maybe there is a cron job that needs to run, or run more often? Or the functionality does work as expected. I am not concerned an admin picking the wrong competencies, I am concerned with the students' view of their learning plan(s). The migrate frameworks is not that intuitive to use. I have looked at it several times, but moving course competencies from the old framework to a new course is not really the functionality I was looking for. I need to reorganize an existing structure, because my business reorganized a department. I need to move a framework to a new category.\nLabel: ",

Normally, course to competency are a one-to-one relationship. Or some courses with multiple activities , may award multiple competencies. There is no search for competencies for students. You need to add the competencies to your courses and then set which course activities will award which competencies.

Maybe someone can give more precisions, but I think this is what will happen. If we think about an institution life-cycle, former year course will be erased, or maybe two or three years ago courses, and eventually we will have data in the data base (who and when acquired a competence, who validated it...) but some of the evidences will go away. Best,\nComment 2: If you need to retain the history of the student's competency, you should not use the course reset option. You could backup, restore a course as a \"new\" name and ID. Deselect the current enrollments and competencies to have a \"fresh\" course for new enrollments and if needed, a competency for the current year/skill.

Adding at the course level would be ideal for what I'm hoping. I want the student to choose which assignment(s) best demonstrate certain non-technical competencies.\nComment 3: Competencies are created in the Competency Framework. Existing competencies are \"related\" to a course. Courses can automatically \"award\" a competency when course activities are completed or they can be manually added by an instructor later. I have never tried to award a competency as a student - it may involve adding permissions to the student role. Best Regards, Shirley\nComment 4: I think maybe I'm not choosing the right terminology here. I don't need students to award themselves the competency. I need students to be able to select which competency (out of the list of competencies associated with the course) that a particular submitted assignment should be included as evidence for. Then I should be able to review the course's associated competencies for that student, and see which assignments they've included as evidence towards that competency. I haven't yet been able to find this in the student workflow ... am I missing something obvious?\nComment 5: Hello, Inside the courses, students are not able to select which activities can prove they are competent in a particular competence, but there is another way that can be useful for you: student learning profiles. If a student clicks on Profile > Learning plans, s/he will find, under the list of Learning plans, an option to add evidences (Links, Files). Once the evidence added s/he can link it to any of the competencies included in his/her learning plans. The problem here is that teachers will not see students' learning plans, as they are outside the courses. Extra permissions will need to be assigned to the person managing the assessment of these competencies. (Look https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Learning_plan_supervisor , https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Learning_plan_viewer and https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=370384 Cheers, R\nComment 6: I have seen college level coursework, when the student's selected from the competency offerings for each course which competency they wanted to apply to their rubric. However, I cannot think of a systemic way of doing this in Moodle. You could include on the course summary page - a list of each of the competencies. Then add within the course a quiz activity with a single select one question. Each of competency is listed and the student \"declares\" which competency value is their goal upon course completion. When the course is successfully completed, the instructor can award the requested competency value. You would still need to build or the competency framework and relate them to the course. Consider how to build out your scales for the competencies before you implement. Such as; Submitted evidence for this competency, no submitted evidence, alternative evidence was submitted.

Competencies are created as of the current date, so they do not exist in the past. You can as an administrator manually rate each student for the competency, but there is no \"gradebook\" type of view for competencies...... That type of editable, view is missing from competencies and learning plans.\nComment 2: Hello, Very interesting question. I am in a similar situation as I have a big bunch of courses dealing with the staff competencies that we would like to manage with the Moodle competencies feature. I guess the solution here would be to [carefully] update the learning plans in the database . Something like a \"bulk manual synchronisation\". For me this would be critical, I think competencies management with Moodle in our faculty development system will be much more successful if we take into account past achievements. I hope I will have time to try it sometime... Best,\nComment 3: Hi Ramon, Thanks for replying - if you manage to get anywhere updating via the database please let me know!\nLabel: ",

What do students see when they click on their learning plans and view their competencies?\nComment 2: Mary, This is helpful and I believe got it, but when I recreated on our 2018-2019 test system, I am still not seeing \"competent\". 1) I can't seem to change the Levels on the current framework. So I Exported and modified the .csv file to add \"default = competent\" then imported it into the 2018-2019 Test system. http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cFinrUFO7X Do you need the course completion Date enabled and does it have to be \"complete\" - pass the date?  On the 2017-2018 system when I added a NEW Framework with the Default + competent settings, it automatically changed. http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cFinrpFO7m Thank you, Tonia\nComment 3: I'm not convinced the end date is significant in the competencies being able to be completed: I think the key is that the default values are competent and proficient, so that when a competency is automatically met it shows as competent. I think it is also significant if you have the same competency in more than one course then it won't show as competent within a course to a teacher who only has a course-specific view, but it might show as met to a manager with an overall view. One issue with competencies is that course teachers don't get the full view -for example if others rate competencies elsewhere, they won't show up as complete in the course. (See Competencies FAQ Are you using learning plans? In your second video, are the competencies in just the one course? The one that shows up as met - is that in just one course? I think there are a lot of variables going on here; hopefully others will have some thoughts as well.\nComment 4: \"I think it is also significant if you have the same competency in more than one course then it won't show as competent within a course to a teacher who only has a course-specific view,\" If the goal is to have one Framework for all courses in a department (Construction Management), so many courses using the same competencies - Is there a better way to do this? The department would want to have a quick view of what courses are meeting what competencies and which students are not. The instructor would want to see which students are meeting each competency within their course. Students would want to see if they have met the competency. There are so many steps. It only takes one to mess up the whole thing. When I think I get all the steps and test it, it isn't working.  So is it something I am missing or is the tool not made to do this? Tonia\nComment 5: Competencies should reflect the specific course objectives. Once a competency is earned, the student will not be required to complete any other course that awards the competency. Each course that you need a student to complete in their learning plan must have a unique competency-course relationship.\nComment 6: Shirley, \"Each course that you need a student to complete in their learning plan must have a unique competency-course relationship\" So if Construction Management has 50 courses and they all use the competency \"Critical Thinking\", I would need to create an individual (50) competency for each course? How would I manage that? And I assume that is also for each quarter. So with 4 quarters, I am now talking about 200 - Critical Thinking competencies for CM. Did I understand that correctly? Tonia\nComment 7: Your Construction Management course sounds like an apprentice program which has many courses the employee is required to complete in order to achieve apprenticeship. I have in the past created the 50 unique course elements, with unique competencies for each of the required skills. The Construction Management can be a certificate that requires the 50 competencies. I would not create one course with 50 elements. I might even consider breaking down the 50 elements into sub-categories - to keep the learners engaged with the apprentice process. The each quarters question needs some additional clarification from you. Do you have new employees each quarter for the same 50 courses? If so, just use cohort sync for the next quarters enrollment to the same 50 courses.\nLabel: ",

It seems that the permission \"manager competency framework\" doesn't include the right to import from csv... There is no link to import, in their admin board The manage framework space in the course view doesn't show an import button Even if we built the link to the import page, the page appears but when we do the import, an access denied shows up Is this really useful feature going to have its own permission in the versions to come? (here is a tracker proposal: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-62272 ) Thanks for your help\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: What role do your Program Directors already have? Managers can by default import competency frameworks and if you make a new role in the system context with the permissiont manage competency framework, and gave it to your program directors in the system context, they should be able to import frameworks but won't see the URL for doing so. However, they could manually add the URL to their dashboard in an HTML block for quick access, I suppose.\nComment 2: Hi Mary, Indeed we didn't do this from the \"manager\" role. We chose to slowly expand from the \"teacher\" role to give extra permissions to our Program Directors. With the current settings, if I build the correct link, I do arrive on the \"import framework\" page, but during the importation I have a \"permission denied\" message. I guess we also have to give them another permission (from the system / manager level), but I have no clue which one. Do you have an idea which complementary permission should be also given? Thanks again for your help. Regards François\nComment 3: I tried simply by making a new, custom role and giving them the permission to manage competency frameworks and view competency frameworks and I then made it a system role and assigned this role to one of the teachers. When the teacher accessed the link (as a link in their dashboard) they were able to import a competency framework. Did you definitely assign this role as a system role?\nComment 4: hi Mary, Nope, I am sure we didn't to it the \"right way\". I am going to suggest your method. I will keep this discussion up to date with our solutions. Thanks again for your help. Best regards François\nComment 5: Hello, I would add another question, very related to the one already formulated. I have imported several competency framework, using my admin account, but when importing I cannot assign them to a category context, only to system level. At a category system we can only add competency frameworks manually added. For universities having several degrees in the same Moodle installation this could be a drawback. Any ideas on how to solve this? Many thanks, Ramón\nLabel: ",

The problem is that each time we import a new CSV a new scale is created with the name of the framework. This is what our scale configuration looks like - [{\"scaleid\":\"3\"},{\"id\":1,\"scaledefault\":1,\"proficient\":1}] ScaleId 3 already exists in the database . Our thought was the scale configration would provied the context on how to create the competency grading type e.g acheived, not achieved. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Many Thanks, Alex\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Alex, You are right, the scale config only refers to level of achievement for the items in the scale.  Is it possible for you to delete the scales that you have created in the past, or are they already associated with graded items and students?  I posted on scales here this morning, that information might be helpful to you.\nComment 2: Hi Erin, I read through your post and it provided some useful information around the\nscale configuration. We have setup one framework on our live Moodle site that has its scale\nconfiguration all correct so that's all fine. As you say I can go back and\ndelete the scale that was created during the import but that is going to be a\nreal pain once we start to import hundreds of BTEC courses. The importer shouldn't really create a new scale if one can be found using\nthe configuration column from the database. The scale configuration as far as I\ncan tell is a JSON string and could be easily used to check to see if the Id\nalready exists and then use that as part of the configuration for the new\nframework. We may have gotten around this issue by push/pulling information from the Moodle\ndatabase. We are creating our own student portal/Staff management site and we\nare going to automate a lot of this process by getting the information from our\ncurriculum database.

You can create duplicate a competency framework annually and you can migrate courses from one version of a competency framework to the next (without having to manually update all the courses). These features can be put together to require someone to annually re-achieve a competency (which is a actually a new competency for every year). Expiring a competency after a time period or on a certain day has been mentioned but I don't think anyone has created a tracker issue for it (it seems like a good idea).\nComment 2: Has there been any development on this topic?

If in February, then go on to complete all 5 competencies (maybe in another course), the plan will still say 1 / 5. If the plan is re-opened - the \"frozen state\" of the plan is deleted - the plan will now say 5 / 5 completed and there will be no record of what their progress was in January.\nLabel: ",

For accreditation purposes, the Milestones are competency-based developmental outcomes (e.g., knowledge, skills, attitudes, and performance) that can be demonstrated progressively by residents and fellows from the beginning of their education through graduation to the unsupervised practice of their specialties. Who developed the Milestones ? Each specialty’s Milestone Working Group was co-convened by the ACGME and relevant American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) specialty board(s), and was composed of ABMS specialty board representatives, program director association members, specialty college members, ACGME Review Committee members, residents, fellows, and others.\nLabel: ",

Also, if you wanted to do it simpler than those two options, you could use the HotQuestion activity as a competency rating or suggestion box with vote capability on each entry. Full disclosure, I currently maintain the HotQuestion plugin. You could also try the Poll block.\nComment 2: We (Dutch Moodle users at our Moot last week) happen to have discussed possibilities for this. If you mean rating competencies in the same way a teacher would do for a student, but more in a peer assessment kind of way, you could try one of the custom roles for this. A huge note of caution though: in peer assessment it's most useful to have at least 3 assessments per user, to have a nicely balanced score/rating. With the current set up of reviewing and rating competencies, this can not be done: 1 rating per competency. This probably has to do with the nature of CBL/CBE and the preferred 'competent/not yet competent' scale for this. In such a black-and-white situation, there is no place for multiple assessments/ratings for any given competency: you're either competent or you're not.\nLabel: ",

MOODLE v3.2 - Competence Frameworks, I am creating a framework at site level (we have no defined standard internationally or nationally).  I have my 5 top level competencies, and I am breaking them down into smaller chunks against which activities will be judged. What I want to know, is at what level I should be defining, or breaking down the competencies into performance criteria at the framework level  and where I I stop and then have the remainder defined within a course.   This is hard to explain. For example, if I have a top level competence, say COMMUNICATE then that is one of the top level competence elements in the framework.   Then say I am testing communication in terms of written and oral.  So I have two subcompetencies COMMUNICATE - written and COMMUNICATE- oral.  Then the written communication requires that the people use the correct systems or technology, use appropriate language, and, say, cover the right material.  Should those three sub-sub-competencies be in the framework, or in the course? Is there any kind of standard that anyone knows of? Many thanks for any thoughts, or any advice on where else this kind of topic is discussed, I know it isn't really to do with moodle, moodle is just the tool, but I figured someone here might have hit this problem before me! Cheers Michelle\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Michelle, This is more a CBE (Competency Based Education) question than a tool one, but I'll see if I can help you (as the topic has my particular interest). The key is to be as concrete as possible when elaborating the competencies in your framework, limiting each competency to one specific behaviour/skill/situation. For your example, this could mean: Communicate Oral Informal I can have a phone conversation I can ask questions about something personally relevant, such as directions to the nearest bus stop etc... Formal Written Informal I can write a post card from my vacation address I can IM with a friend I can write a status update for my social media Formal I can write a formal letter to apply for a job I can write a resumé to accompany my job application I can write an email to a potential employer to apply for a job And so on... one good source for this elaborate breakdown of competencies/skills/can-do statements is the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, aka CEFR. If this is not a foreign language thing you're after, you might want to look into descriptors for soft skills, that are bound to be out there.\nComment 2: Hi Joost! Thanks for the reply,  I have done more research and thought and discussed this at work.  I am going to add one thing.  Thanks for your post, that helped to get me started! Basically I have decided to split the framework elements Vs course measurables using elements that are non-perishable (and hence in framework which stands the test of time) Vs perishable (measurable in course that might change in the future). i.e.  Oral - informal and Oral - Formal would be part of the framework, we can assume that these will be required forever (non-perishable).  However, the medium used for oral communication (phone/video.) is perishable, the phone may cease to exist, video may become hologram (?!) .  I'd argue that the ability to ask questions is non-perishable, where as using a particular system (phone/twitter/facebook etc) are perishable.  So I'd be putting the system based performance criterion in the course, and the non-perishable in the framework. Does this sound sensible to others? Joost, should I be adding this to CBE discussion? Not sure where that is.... Thanks! Michelle\nComment 3: It sounds sensible to me... focus on behaviors, skills (or whatever taxonomy you plan to use) and make them about as specific as is needed, without restricting a behavior to a tool that's presently being used for it. You're right in saying that communication skills don't necessarily depend on the tool used: even when humans used drums or smoke signals, they still needed to master the skill of asking questions, answering them and exchanging information in an efficient way. Same goes for computer skills: tool-related stuff can be managed in in-course tasks (being able to store a document made with MS Office Word on a laptop by using the short key Ctrl-S), whereas the skill 'I can create, edit and save a text document' would be handled in a competency framework.\nLabel: ",

It is great especially in version 3.2 with an easy import / export. If I may, I just make a wish: is there a way not to have the \"ID number\" to fill, each time I create a competency ? Could there be a default \"automatic numbering\" and a \"fill this box if you want a specific ID\" instead? Thanks again for your work (and special Thanks to Mary Cooch for the kind pedagogy provided on this forum) Regards François\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello François and thanks for the compliment. I don't know of an automatic way to have them filled in, but you could make a tracker new feature request and see if others are interested in this as well. https://tracker.moodle.org\nComment 2: Hi, Mary, good Idea and thanks for the link... Although JIRA doesn't allow me to create a new issue (surely not mature enough yet ;) ) I have posted a comment on a closed ticket... Hope nobody will mind too much about it. Have a nice day. Regards François\nComment 3: Hi François, JIRA is a bit of a strict system. In order to be able to post an issue in the Tracker, you have to vote for a number of related issues, so you can prove you're a human being. This prevents the Tracker from being spammed by bots and other things. As for the competency ID numbering, I normally work with a spreadsheet program, set the framework ID to 1000 for instance, the main categories within the framework to 1001, 1002, 1003, etc, and then use the spreadsheet to auto +1 the value for every competency in there. Automating this in the interface may seem like a useful feature, but working with a framework of over 100 competencies, it's a bit of a task keeping track of all the layers and subcompetencies. You have to keep track of the parent competencies and their ID numbers in order to be able to correctly relate them. I found working with a spreadsheet > CSV a lot faster than the interface.\nComment 4: Hi Joost, Thanks a lot for your answer. (No pb about JIRA, It will truly take me some time to do it right anyway ;) ) I perfectly understand the essential use of ID Numbers for competencies. My \"problem\" is the obligation to find a new ID manually in the web interface... each time! As you mentioned it, people who do a framework with accurate numbering tend to do it on Excel anyway. So why not put the default web box to \"auto\" and let user change it if they want a manual override. Exactly like it is for categories: auto num.\nComment 5: Hmm, I think for categories, there are 2 'ID numbers': 1 autonumbered which is also the database ID number corresponding to the category, and 1 optional value that just displays in your category management section. If the developers used this to model the competency settings page, it makes sense that the competency ID number is an optional value, only to be used for reference. And for auto numbering, you'd have to allow for instances who want an alphanumerical ID number, instead of just a numerical value, like 'e1234c345b1' It might be an interesting addition to the interface and workings, and it could be part of improvements to the interface.\nLabel: ",

Now ABCD competency is also linked with Learning Plan AAA . I want this new student to be directly enrolled in learning Plan AAA . How can I achieve this? Do I have to use any API or by writing SQL queries and Php.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Baiju, First of all, there are 2 very different ways of working with competencies, as you already noted: - through student or cohort assigned learning plans - through competencies linked to a specific course and the activities in this course I am not aware of any ways of linking a learning plan to a student, other than creating a learning plan based on a template and then assigning it to a cohort or individual student. Since learning plans can contain competencies from multiple courses, I do not see any analogy with enrolling a student into a course.\nComment 2: In our case. They start with an \"initiation course\" which takes them to higher level courses. So it would be nice if a student gets auto enrolled in a learning plan when joining the first (of many) courses. I'm not saying it should be the default way, but maybe joining a course could be a trigger to join a learning plan. I think people in generally want to have some automated system one way or another so we don't have to babysit whenever a new account gets created or people enroll in a training.\nComment 3: If there are competencies linked to the course (and/or it's activities), these will show up in the Competencies list available to students. Here, a student will see to what degree he is competent, and to which activities the competencies are linked. A teacher can access the competencies breakdown report to see how each student's doing within the course.\nLabel: ",

The way the competency frameworks are meant to be used, is through Learning Plans, that can be linked to cohorts or individual students in your LMS.

The more I've been using the system, the more I've come to this same conclusion.

Knowledge : Understanding aquired through learning. Personal attributes : Inherent characteristics which are brought to the job. Behavior : The observable demonstration of some competency, skill, knowledge and personal attributes attributed to excellent performance. I also think that for some competencies 4 levels is inadequate and for others may be too much. I would like to suggest that the framework be more adjustable and editable.

The framework can actually have any number of levels. If you have less than 4 - the last taxonomy terms from the edit competency framework form will just not be used. If you create a framework and add more than 4 levels of competencies to it, then go back to the edit competency framework form - you will see you can choose taxonomy terms for the additional levels (no limit).

On my test server running a Debian/ Apache config with Moodle 3.2, I run into issues importing competency frameworks using the csv-import. After importing the first competency framework (600+ competencies), I get time-out messages (exceeded 30 seconds) and memory allocation issues. Example: Fatal error : Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in /var/www/html/moodle320/admin/tool/lpimportcsv/classes/framework_importer.php on line 280 Help solving this is welcome, as I've prepared 8 big competency frameworks, some of which I've tested on the qa. moodle.net site. Thanks in advance!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I created https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-57292 to make sure we increase these limits when importing frameworks. In the meantime you could try increasing your max_execution_time in php.ini (if you have access to do that).\nComment 2: Hi Joost, If you are not able to change the max_execution_time in php.ini, as mentioned by Damyon, you could try backing up a course on qa.moodle.net with your competencies, and then restore with competencies into your own site.\nComment 3: Hi AL, Damyon, Hopefully the max execution time solves the issue. It happens with competency framework csv files of approximately 80 kilobytes. I don't know whether this is too big for a generic moodle installation or not. The qa.moodle.net site also handled these files in a similar fashion, resulting in a bad gateway error. Edit ==> I increased both execution time (first to 0, then to 2 hrs) and memory limit (2GB), but to no avail.\nComment 4: Hi AL and Damyon, Apparently, I solved the problem by removing all the lines in my csv that didn't have an ID number linked to it. Somehow that's where it goes wrong, because since solving this, I've been able to upload competency frameworks without a hitch. The plugin could however do with a more suitable error page when the imported csv file ends up not being valid because of such things. An HTTP 500, Bad Gateway or connection timed out page from the browser does not tell the developer where to correct the file. For people constructing these frameworks, it's very tempting to have these 'comment' lines in the document while building, in order to know how it is structured.\nLabel: ",

On completion of the training they can print out a certificate for their records and for evidence when loading onto a competency database .\n\nHow can i make the course so they can access again and reattempt the training as if they had never completed before with a new certificate with the correct date? I hope that makes sense?? I have it set at the moment so they must spend 40 minutes on the activity before a certificate will be issued (video is 41 minutes long) The training will be conducted by a lot of people (Potentially 100,000+) so this process needs to be completely automated, also they may access it at any time over the training year.\n\nThanks in advance for any help/guidance you may have\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

The assignment evaluation works well and that student gets the default value to these competencies. But then I edit the Competency framework and modify the erroneous scale default value... the evaluation does not change for this student. He keep the old values. Is it  a way to force the re-evaluation of the competencies and give the new default value to all students whose have been evaluated before the modification ? Sure, I can set up a SQL request and update the table competency_usercomp, field grade from 2 to 3 for example, but this would be better if we had  that option in Moodle ;>)) It may be then a cron update...\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Jean, Unfortunately I think the only option right now would be to write a custom script to do that.

Could you explain a bit more what you mean please? It is possible in a course for the teacher to see the Competency breakdown report for each student which allows the teacher to see the status of course competencies for each student. Are you saying you want a different report, which lists students and competencies together (like the grader report) where you see in a list the class/group of students and which competencies they have met/not met?\nComment 2: Thank you for your answer. I would like, as a teacher, to see the results of all\nlearning plans for any given student, the way they can see it themselves, as\nsome kind of grader report, only for the learning plans. Regards, Philippe\nComment 3: How do I run a report that shows me how students in my class, building and system are doing on a particular competency. For instance, a competency in Minnesota 4th grade Science is \" 4.2.3.2.3, Demonstrate how an electric current can produce a magnetic force. For example: Construct an electromagnet to pick up paperclips.\" That competency (Minnesota calls it a benchmark) is one competency in the group of standards, named, 'Energy can be transformed within a system or transferred to other systems or the environment.' The group that that standard is in is called \"Energy\" which is a group in the larger group, Physical Science, which is in the larger group Mn 4th Grade Science Standards. I would like to use an off line submission of an Assignment activity that includes a rubric to determine whether or not the student(s) have achieved mastery of that competency. I would likely have a comprehension quiz and another simple assignment on which students would need to earn a certain grade and complete before they attempted the Construct an electromagnet project. As the Director of Elementary Science (theoretically) for a school district that includes 45 elementary schools that each have on average 3 classes of 4th graders, I want to run a report on that competency by class, by building and for the whole district. I would also like to be able to drill down and view the artifact submitted by each student, and the completed rubric with teacher comments, in fulfillment of this competency. There are twenty other 'benchmarks' in 4th Grade Science with hierarchical groupings at each of the above levels. I will also like to run reports on aggregations of those 'scores' by all of the above. How do I set-up reports like that? Here's a pdf of all of the Minnesota K12 Science Minnesota K-12 Academic Standards in Science (2009)\nLabel: ",

Can someone please enlighten how it is different from outcomes? As it is stated in MoodleDocs for Outcomes : Outcomes are specific descriptions of what a student has demonstrated and understood at the completion of an activity or course. Each outcome is rated by some sort of scale. Other terms for outcomes are Competencies and Goals.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Greetings Martin - I agree - I was just about to post this - so thank you.\nComment 2: I also agree about outcomes and competencies being confusing! In Moodle, there is a site administration setting called 'Enable outcomes' and in 3.1, the description of this setting has been changed to 'If enabled, grade items may be graded using one or more scales tied to outcome statements.' Thus, outcomes in Moodle are to do with grading only. There is also a site administration setting in 3.1 called 'Enable competencies', the description of which is 'Competencies allow users to be assessed according to learning plans.' The documentation Competencies provides a fuller explanation, mentioning competency frameworks too. Thus, competencies in Moodle 3.1 are a lot more complex than outcomes!\nComment 3: As always Helen - excellent clear description. May I please add that we may need both Competencies and outcomes in the gradebook. Our ministry looks very closely at the \"outcomes of our competencies\" and we need a method in the course to assess how many students achieved the competency and report that in our Ministry reports. We are now very integrated to the Moodle gradebook and in my opinion in the short time I spent in working through the competency framework - I would love to be able to attach it to the graded item and to evaluate the results through the gradebook. I know there is a work around but I would like to encourage the developers to add them to the gradebook for adding it to a graded item and the category. Thank you again, Nancy K.\nLabel: ",

You can get it anyway from github at https://github.com/damyon/moodle-tool_lpimportcsv It needs to be installed in yourmoodle/admin/tool and once installation is completed, you will have an Import and Export link added under Competencies. Works nicely and will let you match your csv file columns to the one used by Moodle CBE frameworks, if they are not the same already.\nComment 2: Sorry, I missed the part where you asked about using git to install it.
