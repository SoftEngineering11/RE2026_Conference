I use AI in a lot of places in my plugins. I route almost all requests to my own servers and completely bypass the AI subsystem. Partly because this process pre-dates the AI subsystem. And partly because I don't think the AI subsystem does what I need (thats what my questions will be about). But I do want to use it, and ideally I could begin the process of allowing users to route AI requests via the subsystem if they preferred to. As a representative example of a use case - in Poodll Wordcards we need pictures for the WordCards. So I wanted to use the subsystem, and I made a placement plugin so we could generate images. That worked. But then I went back to the old way. Question 1) Do we really need a placement plugin for each place we want to generate a image? (clarification: This is not about using the HTML editor.) I mean, do we need one for Poodll WordCards and one for Poodll MiniLesson and one the Moodle repository etc. Is that really the case? If not, cool. Please tell me what to do instead. If however it is the case. I don't mind coding a few lightweight plugins. I kind of mind having to maintain them on the plugins directory and through each Moodle version update. I do mind having to get my users to install new plugins for what are basically features. Perhaps my needs are some sort of edge case and the html editor is fine for most people. But how about: The file manager - of course we need image generation there. Automated generation content - Poodll has an AI lesson builder it takes a few prompts and goes off builds incredible lessons with loads of images and audio. Most mods will have something like that soon. Bulk image generation - making 10 images in series is slow. Making 10 images in parallel is fast. And that is just images. In fact text generation is a bigger issue. Basically most of my plugins will need a companion AI placement plugin. It seems too much. A hook or callback feature seems more appropriate. Question 2) How about all the other AI things we need to do? A few examples: give students feedback on their submission. give students a score on their submission modify previously generated images transcribe speech. Most of this is programmatic use of AI. Trying to know in advance what kind of AI action is required and make it available as a placement, seems like forever playing catch up. Thats partly because we don't know what we don't know. And partly because AI is advancing at such a rate new functionality is arriving regularly. The list could just get really really long. How do we get new actions into the system? I need all of those things now. Is it possible to have a catch all that allows us to effectively use the engines creds and supply our own implementation of the request and response handling? I mean, I am sure we can do that now, but I do want to play by the rules. Is that against the rules?\nLabel: ",

Our Moodle install can only send out requests through a proxy which is configured in config.php for curl and in the Settings/ Server /HTTP/Web proxy However, when I try to generate text, I don't see any requests (accepted or rejected) on the proxy side. Are the providers requests automatically routed through the proxy or is there some config I need to do elsewhere. For example for the Stack Plugin goes through the proxy when I use the Server(proxy) platform type. Any help or information is appreciated. Kind Regards, Ben\nLabel: ",

AI generation of Rubrics that can be imported as Rubric based assignments into Moodle and then also use AI to grade submissions and import the complete graded rubric and comments back into Moodle.\n\nThe application framework is Flutter/Dart and we have it available for review in Github. No local data storage is used as the system leverages the user's Moodle account and the Moodle data/auth/roles to define what can be done in the app. No personally identifiable information is sent to the AI; only the required prompt and assignment submission/rubric.\n\nTeachers have the ability to override, edit, or otherwise adjust all AI generated content or grading.\n\nThe app can be run as a web app or natively as a Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, or iOS application.\n\nOur goal is to collect teacher data about using AI as a teacher helper tool and if our application has any impact on teachers' attitudes about AI use.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or would like to talk about the details.\n\nThank you,\nScott McGlynn\nLabel: ",

I use AI in a lot of places in my plugins. I route almost all requests to my own servers and completely bypass the AI subsystem. Partly because this process pre-dates the AI subsystem. And partly because I don't think the AI subsystem does what I need (thats what my questions will be about). But I do want to use it, and ideally I could begin the process of allowing users to route AI requests via the subsystem if they preferred to. As a representative example of a use case - in Poodll Wordcards we need pictures for the WordCards. So I wanted to use the subsystem, and I made a placement plugin so we could generate images. That worked. But then I went back to the old way. Question 1) Do we really need a placement plugin for each place we want to generate a image? (clarification: This is not about using the HTML editor.) I mean, do we need one for Poodll WordCards and one for Poodll MiniLesson and one the Moodle repository etc. Is that really the case? If not, cool. Please tell me what to do instead. If however it is the case. I don't mind coding a few lightweight plugins. I kind of mind having to maintain them on the plugins directory and through each Moodle version update. I do mind having to get my users to install new plugins for what are basically features. Perhaps my needs are some sort of edge case and the html editor is fine for most people. But how about: The file manager - of course we need image generation there. Automated generation content - Poodll has an AI lesson builder it takes a few prompts and goes off builds incredible lessons with loads of images and audio. Most mods will have something like that soon. Bulk image generation - making 10 images in series is slow. Making 10 images in parallel is fast. And that is just images. In fact text generation is a bigger issue. Basically most of my plugins will need a companion AI placement plugin. It seems too much. A hook or callback feature seems more appropriate. Question 2) How about all the other AI things we need to do? A few examples: give students feedback on their submission. give students a score on their submission modify previously generated images transcribe speech. Most of this is programmatic use of AI. Trying to know in advance what kind of AI action is required and make it available as a placement, seems like forever playing catch up. Thats partly because we don't know what we don't know. And partly because AI is advancing at such a rate new functionality is arriving regularly. The list could just get really really long. How do we get new actions into the system? I need all of those things now. Is it possible to have a catch all that allows us to effectively use the engines creds and supply our own implementation of the request and response handling? I mean, I am sure we can do that now, but I do want to play by the rules. Is that against the rules?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: This is a *really* interesting question Justin, and one that think many developers are struggling with. I feel that that \"placements\" function is a complex / complicated route to govern where the end-user interaction or initiation of an AI action takes place. This is probably fine in the case of *some* interactions. But I think it overall takes away from the Developer's to make good decisions (or and potentially *bad* decisions) about where and what that initiation looks like. So personally \"I\" don't like this approach... The other aspect is really the back-end consumption of AI \"services\" by a Moodle plugin. This in my mind should not need any sort of \"placement\", it really needs to be a mechanism for the developer to get back some sort of interface that will route their request to a \"relevant\" / appropriate LLM provider instance. This is of itself a complicated question if we're to allow individual system administrators to have the agency to *decide* which LLM provider they want to use, and this could conflict with some developers who don't want to afford sys-admins that flexiblity (say for instance your AI experience relies on a *very* specific model that *you're* hosting). On this front I prefer the approach the By-cs's local_ai_manager plugin has taken, in offering \"purposes\" and \"providers\" so that the systems admin can assert \"this LLM is for this purpose\", and *every* complying AI plugin that wants to \"generate an image\" will use it. It doesn't preclude a developer writing an \"I need a very specific image generation purpose\" and then requiring the admin to wire that purpose up to a very specific LLM instance... (Full disclosure, we've been playing in that very area to look at doing \"RAG\" and \"Text Embedding\" purpose for this plugin, so we sort of know that adding newer more specific purposes can be done here). But in both the Moodle system and the By-CS one there is definitely an \"arms-length-ness\" to calling an LLM, it's by no means \"direct\" (in Moodle you have go via the placement, and in the local_ai_manager you need to go via a purpose)\nComment 2: Hi Michael. Since writing that post, I realised that it was not getting any replies (till yours, thanks) because there were not really any good answers to the questions. Actually ... I found the docs .. that explain that and other things ... thanks. https://github.com/bycs-lp/moodle-local_ai_manager/blob/main/docs/plugindev/index_plugindev.md\nComment 3: Hi Justin, the documentation of local_ai_manager is probably only rudimentary, so if you have questions or requirements, reach out to me/us. Also, while we tried to make it behave to cover the typical use cases, it primarily addresses our requirements for Bavarian schools. So there is a chance that other \"typical\" use cases are not implemented as the default behavior or there is documentation missing on how to achieve certain things. If you encounter something in this regard, just contact us. Philipp\nComment 4: \"If you encounter something in this regard, just contact us.\" I have found Philipp and the team he works with to be highly responsive in the two years or so I have been collaborating with them.\nLabel: ",

I need different \"Source of truth\" for each chapter of the book. how can this be done?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Which AI Chat block?\nComment 2: We are developing together with eLeDia a moodle-rag and the ollama-chat block. moodle-rag will parse activities and files in Moodle and display the corresponding sources in the chat block. The access rights of individual users are respected, meaning only sources that the user has access to will be displayed. For more information, please send me a message.\nComment 3: OPEN AI\nComment 4: Open ai are the supplier of the LLM, what is the name of the Moodle code you are using ? Nooooo, I was entirely wrong, there is a chat block called  OpenAI, and I have installed and played with it in the past. https://moodle.org/plugins/block_openai_chat This is probably the bit that answers your question. \" Although the AI is very capable out-of-the-box, if it doesn't know the answer to a question, it is more likely to confidently give incorrect information than to refuse to answer. The plugin provides a text area at both the block instance level as well as the plugin level where teachers or administrators can include a list of questions and answers that the AI will ingest before generating a completion; as a result, the AI is more likely to provide accurate information when a submitted query is similar to the questions it has been given direct answers to. For example, an AI that hasn't been provided any extra information may respond to the query \"What color is the car?\" with a random color, such as red. However, if the following is included in the source of truth box:\"\nComment 5: Thanks, do you recommend using this tool? Do you know of any alternative tools? Better ones. I don't prefer tools that won't infringe copyright. Thanks\nComment 6: We also built out a rudimentary Moodle RAG system on top of the SOLR backend (which is also available for Global Search): https://github.com/mhughes2k/moodle-search_solrrag The issue we found isn't just respecting what sources the user has access to, there is a separate question of which sources are permissmible to be used in an AI action. For instance a PDF of a Journal article could be added to a Moodle site, but there is no way to say that it can't be parsed to create an embedding or that it's retrieved content can't then be passed on for summarisation. At the moment there is no mechanism to describe the permitted uses of content.\nComment 7: I was quite excited when I first used it and there is nothing inherently wrong with it as a Chat block. I liked the way you could use your own \"source of truth\".. However I am not convinced that ChatBlocks offer the most effective and safe use of AI. The people at Mebis (Bavaria) have a whole suite of plugins (including a chat block) that focus on privacyt/data protection/token counting/limiting who has access to the AI. https://github.com/orgs/bycs-lp/repositories They also use my own AI Text question type which uses an AI to give feedback to quiz questions.  Their Question generation plugin is very impressive. You can see my presentation about my Quiz question type in this video. (let me know if that works or search on Moodle Academy ai if that link doesn't work)... It may seem like AI in education is everywhere but in reality it is early days and things are changing very, very quickly.\nLabel: ",

I have asked that question a couple of other ways, and it does give the same basic WRONG answer each time. What it does give applies much more with what the Poodle Filter does. LOL Like you, I am actually more interested in what it can come up with for lessons and writing prompts. Maybe even evaluation of a students writing as to how well they may have followed the lesson or prompt requirements.\nComment 7: Yesterday, I was having fun with two of my Raspberry Pi5's, comparing results of the one with the new 26 TOPS AI HAT to another with a SSD HAT. I was puzzled that both of them had almost the exact same verbose results, but I was interrupted further investigations by one of those necessary life events that butted in...had to go grocery shopping! LOL When I got back, it suddenly dawned on me why they were giving me very similar results. The Pi 5's have a new PCI Express Interface ribbon connector on the rear edge of the board. The AI HAT uses that connection for the communicating with the AI HAT, meaning the OS and memory storage all has to go on a Micro SDC memory chip. The other PI with a 1TB SSD, is running the OS and memory storage on the SSD and does not even have a Micro SDC memory chip plugged in. When I got that particular Pi 5, I had to do an initial setup using a Micro SDC memory chip and was amazed how much faster it appeared when I finished moving the OS over to the SSD. I currently have Ollama set up on it using the llama3.2:3b model which granted, is not as fast with it's answers, as those you can get elsewhere, but, as I have mentioned before, no matter how much I ask it, it will not suddenly want to start charging me for access to it. If anyone want to try it out, send me a private message with a desired user name and password so I can set it up. If anyone is interested, note that I have created an AI provider plugin like the two now included in Moodle, and hope to get the settings to work with one of my Pi's, soon. Almost forgot to mention, if you want to try AI on your OWN Raspberry Pi, try to get a 16GB version. Makes a huge difference in which models you can run/use.\nLabel: ",

I have just found this page https://ai4physed.physik.uni-muenchen.de/LEAP/home and I think it would be great to have something like this in Moodle, preferably with grading of the answers. Regards\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Could you explain what that does, I just got a login screen with a create an account option.\nComment 2: Hi, You can create assignments there including media etc. Basically like the Moodle assignments. However, you then have to provide a sample solution or an expectation horizon. The AI then corrects the assignment and gives feedback to the student. It would be great if this could be built into the Moodle assignment as an option. Sorry for the late reply, I looks like the emails from Moodle.org going straight into my spam folder Harald\nComment 3: This sounds great. This is something we are currently exploring with our team. This is giving us hope that it is possible.\nComment 4: Or perhaps also to have Essay quiz questions like this, because we can have some level of protection there, preventing students from pasting in any ready-made answers (possibly copied from another AI service).\nLabel: ",

Thanks in advance\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Not that I am aware of and I doubt if anything like that will be available in the near future. I'm not convinced that AI would be the essential tool for helping to achieve that, though of course it could use it.\nComment 2: Thank you for your response.

The system aims to identify the learner's weaknesses and tailor the courses accordingly. However, I have not yet been able to convert it into a plugin. In addition to this, for the training of the neural network, the system tracks all response times to questions and the time spent reading correction notes for errors. It’s still a work in progress, but the aim is to make it fully functional for personalized learning. Here is the fork: https://github.com/TempoSrl/moodle\nLabel: ",

It has two key components:\n\n1. AI generation of assessments that can be automatically imported as Moodle Quizzes\n2. AI generation of Rubrics that can be imported as Rubric based assignments into Moodle and then also use AI to grade submissions and import the complete graded rubric and comments back into Moodle.\n\nThe application framework is Flutter/Dart and we have it available for review in Github. No local data storage is used as the system leverages the user's Moodle account and the Moodle data/auth/roles to define what can be done in the app. No personally identifiable information is sent to the AI; only the required prompt and assignment submission/rubric.\n\nTeachers have the ability to override, edit, or otherwise adjust all AI generated content or grading.\n\nThe app can be run as a web app or natively as a Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, or iOS application.\n\nOur goal is to collect teacher data about using AI as a teacher helper tool and if our application has any impact on teachers' attitudes about AI use.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or would like to talk about the details.\n\nThank you,\nScott McGlynn\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Interesting! would like to test it!\nLabel: ",

Is it somehow possible to define in which activities the summarise function is enabled?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: For the time being, no, unfortunately. You can prevent students from seeing the summarise button in the whole course by overriding the capability aiplacement/courseassist:summarise_text for that particular course but not for individual activities within the course. There is a tracker issue to improve this and you might like to watch or vote for it: / MDL-83156 AI: Improve user access controls.\nComment 2: Thanks for the update, Mary.\nComment 3: I added a note to the AI placements documentation about restricting placements, ie how to prevent students from generating summarised content, etc.\nLabel: ",
