There are so many things you can do with it, especially get students of foreign languages to speak, which is not an easy task given that they are often very numerous in a university class... Wo use Read Aloud a lot, but I'm new to Minilessons, and haven't been using the widgets much either. So here's the question: in some cases, like in Minilesson or Speechcards, Poodll seems to consider my answers as incorrect how ever hard I try. In the Speechcards items I get like two stars out of three but I'm stuck there (I would love to use this to create structural exercises like Does he like it?|Yes he does - that's a great additional possibility!). I can't see any settings to configure the way it is graded, like I do in Read Aloud - would anyone know if that's possible, and how to do it? Thank you!\nLabel: ",

Is the teachers marking Audio or video feedbakc hosted on the same server of offloaded elsewhere? 2. If it is on the moodle HTML server does this terrific tool allow the video or audio files to be hosted else where off server? eg free file hosting services? 3.

Also, when we attempted to submit an audio assignment, the recorder would appear, the audio would be recorded and could be listened to but when submitted, the recorder showed up again on screen and the page was still loading (spinning).  I noticed a brief glance of some debug information and realized that moodle was set to debug email sending.  If I stopped the page, and went back to view the assignment, the audio was uploaded and working (blue flow player).  When I turned the debug off, it appeared to work. Also, for some reason, a tester indicated that they were unable to use the recorder but then it started working.  I know this is minimal information but is it possible that cache needed to be cleared or permissions for player needed to be accepted? Any advice would be appreciated.  If I have more additional comments, I will add them. Thanks Eric\nLabel: ",

I am evaluating Poodll in a self hosted virtual instance of Moodle, and have found that although small mobile video files under 10MB will generally upload via Poodll and play back without issue on the source device, once the file size exceeds roughly 15-20MB, then things start to fall apart. Background... My use case requires that all students will be submitting assignments via mobile device platforms, which if I understand correctly would be best served by converting submissions via FFMPEG for widest mobile platform compatibility. Therefore, I have built FFMPEG on my test server from sources, and have verified that when called from the system path, it is working correctly. I have also verified via shell command that the FFMPEG switches used on the poodll demo site are working. Therefore, I assume that the Poodll Filter settings to auto convert mobile submissions to MP4 and to use FFMPEG for the conversion are also working, although I have yet to determine how to verify this as I have not seen any entries in any server logs. Back to the problem at hand... Without FFMPEG settings enabled in the Poodll filter, files of any size, up to the server limit of 512MB, will upload from a mobile device without issue. Playback is choppy over mobile data, but plays smoothly via WiFi, suggesting that playback quality is bandwidth dependent. With FFMPEG conversion settings enabled in the Poodll filter, mobile uploads above approximately 15MB in size will cause a browser error on Chrome, or will simply never complete the upload process in Firefox . In Chrome, after selecting a mobile video larger than 15MB to upload, the progress bar never appears and within about 15 seconds Chrome will throw an \"Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage...\" error. In Firefox, after selecting a mobile video to upload larger than 15MB, the progress bar will appear, but no indication of upload activity will be evident and the process never completes. Obviously, in both cases Mobile uploads will fail. Since it is possible to turn on the mobile upload processing error, and turn it off, by enabling and disabling the FFMPEG conversion settings in the Poodll filter, I assume that the root issue is with the filter and not my environment, but I would appreciate some other perspectives or troubleshooting  suggestions on the matter. Moodle is running on a Debian (Jesse) instance, with 2GB of RAM, 60GB HD, and PHP.INI settings that allow up tp 512MB uploads and 640MB of script memory. Regards; Michael\nLabel: ",

PoodLL has had great uptake from the Moodle community and the users have been positive through the good times, and patient and understanding through trouble times. So going premium is not something I have taken likely. At its heart is the reality that PoodLL needs a lot of work to make the full transition to HTML5 and for a host of other feature improvements and better support options (incl. documentation). You can read more on an this here: http://poodll.com/?p=2107 It will be available as an annual subscription with 3 tiers of membership: i) individual teacher (aka little guy) ii) single institution/organization iii) partner The pricing and some other details are yet to be decided, but from now on there will be more no more updates published on Moodle.org or the existing GitHub repositories, other than bug and security fixes. In the past I maintained a mailing list of PoodLL users, but these days that list doesn't contain the large majority of users. So currently there is no direct way for me to communicate with the PoodLL user base.  It would be very helpful for me if as a PoodLL user you could take this quick 8 question survey. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/63DJ529\nLabel: ",

It all works flawlessly on Chrome and Edge, but on Firefox (v43.0.4, the latest one with the latest flash plugin), it doesn't work. I can start the recording (after giving Flash permission to use my microphone), I then proceed to stop it and I see an \"uploading\" spinning symbol, but when it finishes the recording hasn't been actually saved, nothing plays when I click on the play button of the plugin, or when I save the supposedly recorded audio and use the media player to listen to it. Not even if I submit the assignment. One thing I can tell is different from when I try this same action on Chrome and Edge is that on those browsers, while I speak, the volume bar in the plugin shows feedback (with green and red bars), while on Firefox that doesn't happen. I've been able to test this in a couple computers running Windows 10 and the latest version of Firefox, both with exact same results. In those same computers, using Chrome or Edge works fine. Is this some sort of bug in Firefox (or the plugin) not actually enabling the microphone? Any way around it? Thanks so much in advance for any feedback, this plugin is awesome! Edit: I forgot to mention that I also tried with the audio submission example in the Poodll demo site ( http://demo.poodll.com/mod/assign/view.php?id=87&action=view ) with same exact results, so it's not something related to my Moodle site or my server ...\nLabel: ",

Last week I decide to update Poodll plugin (filter and Question types: Recording) of my moodle. unfortunately all Whiteboards questions didn't work now! When student has completed the whiteboard with their answers, after validation of the question, Moodle tell them that they don't have answer yet. And if teacher try to see student's work, it's the same thing. I try to use all diferent whiteboards : nothing change... modify a question and save it again : nothing change... Also purge all cache of moodle : nothing change... It's the second time I have this problem. First time, to solve it, I do another moodle with an installation of the new plugin poodll and after restore all courses. Actually, I have no time to do this (and I really want to know what's happen and solve the problem).\nLabel: ",

Since then I haven't seen anything on this issue.  With the release of Moodle 3.0, this becomes a bit more pressing.  I've nothing against the premium concept, and given how important I find Poodll, I'm principally in favour of the move.  But I would like to know what the situation is. For example, will the current version (which I understand will not be actively supported in future) still work with future Moodle versions?  I guess ony Justin can answer this, but for many people this could be important. Has anyone tried  Poodll with 3.0?  Have there been any issues? Given that a lot of language teachers rely on Poodll in their courses, it would be nice to have an update so that the planning can begin. (If I have missed an article/post about this, then I apologise and would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.) All the best Andy\nLabel: ",

But what should you check when it happens? Well first of all its a general error. And it tells you/the student that your recording will not be saved. That is important. At this point your recording is already gone. There is probably nothing you can do but re record. Things to check i) is the microphone capturing sound? Or the video camera capturing your picture. If not, then there is nothing to submit or convert. And you might get this error. ii) does a very short recording get submitted ok? Sometimes longer recordings have problems at the server or browser level. iii) what recorder are you using? The two audio recorders look similar but are completely different. The video one is different again but in terms of troubleshooting its identical to the red5 audio recorder. MP3 recorder: recordings get less reliable as they get longer. Best not to venture over 2 mins. conversion to MP3 happens before the upload . If the file is too big it might spin forever and give up if the upload begins but throws an error, the connection to the Moodle server is problematic. Check the browser console for errors related to the file being posted. Some servers restrict the upload file size. Thats a whole new ball game, but if thats the case small uploads will be working. audio recorder/video recorder (red5): if you can't play it back after recording.... then the file never arrived on the Red5 server. Check the connection lamp on the recorder. Should be green. If its red or yellow your connection is bad (firewall? ) or the red5 server is down (happens.) If you can play it back, but get the error message above ... then the problem is that your file can't be collected from the Red5 server and copied back into Moodle. Turn off auto convert to mp3/mp4 in the filter settings and try again (or uncheck the mp3/mp4 checkbox on the recorder BEFORE recording). If conversion is the issue then its best to set up FFMPEG on the Moodle server and have PoodLL do its magic with that. Check the port settings in the PoodLL filter settings for HTTP. Your Moodle server will need to be able to do a server to server connection to that port on the  Red5 server to pick up the recorded file.\nLabel: ",

The instructor had the same problem in leaving voice feedback for students. Is there anyway for students and instructors to listen to files after they've been submitted?

Information on how to do that is here: http://poodll.com/flash-and-poodll/ In short, in the PoodLL filter settings, widgets, players and recorders can be limited to HTML5 only in the \"When to use HTML5\" section. The default whiteboard can be selected in the \"Whiteboard settings\" section. N.B. The non flash whiteboards (LiterallyCanvas and DrawingBoard.js) are not working properly in Moodle 2.9 yet. I am not actually advising anyone to turn Flash off. I will leave that to people more knowledgeable than me. But if you are in a situation where you cannot use Flash, the above settings should do the job.\nLabel: ",

The instructions say to upload and unzip the folder to Moodle's main directory. It goes on to say \"All of the components are already in their necessary directories and should arrive in the right place\" and that \"Moodle will set up most of the specific elements of PoodLL for you. We just have to let Moodle know we installed it. To do this, after you have copied the PoodLL modules, make sure you are logged in as admin, and click “notifications” in the site administration block. Moodle should recognize that several plugins need installing. It will recognize four new mods(filter, assignment type, question type and repository) and guide you through several install pages.\" Problem is Moodle hasn't recognised the plugins and I can't get on with the rest of the set up that follows this initial upload. Do I need to move any of the plugin folders somewhere else from the poodllall_2013022200 folder I've uploaded. Any pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks\nLabel: ",

Did you have every student install a specific voice recording app?  How did you manage those recordings.

The User sees a list of courses, renamed as “___ Tests”. Each Course consists of one Quiz; when completed they have completed the Course. 2. User chooses to take Quiz, then ideally they are auto-enrolled(? they are already registered and logged in, so can we do this?) . 3. They see preface screen to the test, showing them test-taking info and links, advisories about the test, etc. 4. They start the fifteen minute timed quiz. The video tapes them automatically and they see the recorder (themselves) on screen. A proctor will review it, to compare it to \"face on file\", and to prevent cheating in several ways (looking at notes, asking someone for answers, etc). 3. Those videos are then deleted, unless there is a controversy. The effort so far: Thanks in advance, and my apologies if we missed something obvious! Greg\nLabel: ",

The cheat sheet contains information about those crafty filter strings.

Keen to have students record their own voices so downloaded Poodll Kabodle. Noticed the version was only up to 2,5 but went ahead anyway because I am that sort of guy. Uploaded the zip to my site, extracted, copied directories. Noticed there as no overwrite messages as suggested in the Poodll docs  but Moodle upgraded my database and declared the whole thing a success, Added an assignment and sure enough there is a Poodl voice recorder and whiteboard option and I ticked the mp3 submission. The assignment does not show the recorder widget though- what have I missed? The assignment does not have any sort of recording feature available. I checked the docs and it mentioned configuring Modules->Filters->Manage Filters under site admin. I can't locate this. Is it my version or just me lost in the menus?\nLabel: ",

There are so many things you can do with it, especially get students of foreign languages to speak, which is not an easy task given that they are often very numerous in a university class... Wo use Read Aloud a lot, but I'm new to Minilessons, and haven't been using the widgets much either. So here's the question: in some cases, like in Minilesson or Speechcards, Poodll seems to consider my answers as incorrect how ever hard I try. In the Speechcards items I get like two stars out of three but I'm stuck there (I would love to use this to create structural exercises like Does he like it?|Yes he does - that's a great additional possibility!). I can't see any settings to configure the way it is graded, like I do in Read Aloud - would anyone know if that's possible, and how to do it?

So I can answer to it. But in production it's not likely to be much use. Unless you have complete control of the PCs that will access it. Some of those settings did not trigger the save process. I can't recall why now. But try changing each setting on the settings page and see if it sticks.\nComment 2: Hi Justin, I tested mic today again, and what you said is true, and correct. The recording now is at good high volume. Probably Yesterday the site wide settings did not get applied properly.

Can someone direct me how to enable the video Feedback PoodLL?  Thanks! David\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Have you been to Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > Assignment > Feedback plugins > Feedback PoodLL, and made sure that for, Recorders to enable, you have Video Recorder enabled? The other place to check is edit your assignment activity, scroll down to the Feedback types, and for PoodLL Recorder Type, set it to Video Recorder.\nComment 2: Thanks, AL - that's exactly what I was missing.  I appreciate the help on such a simple question! Is there a way to dynamically (i.e., within the assignment feedback screen) switch between audio and video as an option for feedback? I went to the gear to shut off the webcam, but I don't see a way to turn that off (as a way to preserve the video option, but use only audio for a once-off, for example). Cheers, David\nComment 3: I don't think there is any way to switch except for going to the edit page for the assignment, and changing it there. Of course, if you do that, it would change it for all grading after that. A couple of things you might try: If you have the PoodLL Record Anywhere, see if you can record directly into the text box for feedback. Might not be able to do if that box is not set to allow any type of media insert/ upload . Another possibility if you have the PoodLL Repository set it up is to set the assignment to allow for feedback files. Then go through the steps to upload a file, but select the Poodll repository, make your audio or video recording, and then upload it. That's one of the things I used to do before retiring so I presume it might still work.\nComment 4: Good stuff - thanks AL.  I'll give these both a try.  I've done some basic LMS admin stuff before, but not on Moodle.  So, I'm new to the Moodle game.  I appreciate your time and good suggestions, and will get with our engineers to have those other PoodLL tools installed (I've seen them, but hadn't thought about incorporating more of them).  Cheers and thanks for a good first post conversation, David.\nComment 5: Hi David Al is  spot on with all his advice. Right now there is no elegant way to do adhoc video feedback when audio is selected as the Poodll feedback type. Its a top idea though. We are working on a new plugin a bit like this, and we might just add that feature in.\nComment 6: Thanks Justin.  I used AL's suggestions and that worked perfectly - to turn on the option I want in the Feedback Type within the named Assignment.  Indeed, it'd be great to be able to also do that on-the-fly within that feedback area of the grading screen (or, at the least, keep it as video feedback, but be able to turn off the video real-time).  I look forward to seeing what plugin you are working on!

This is done using Deferred Feedback after answering all questions.

General feedback only appears once student has submitted the item. For example, we include a copy of our grading rubric for students to see. You could include insert the model recording here so that students can listen to it after having submitted their quiz.

Student reads a question Student records an answer with PoodLL Student compares their own answer to a model answer in \"general Feedback\" Student grades their answer (so the Teacher doesn't have to\") Steps 1 through 3 are obviously already standard quiz steps. The fourth is important for me since the objective of the exercise I'm trying to build is the checking of the answer (and not necessarily the answering). I realize this is probably a general Moodle question rather than PoodLL specific, but since I got no answer in the general Moodle forums, I thought maybe another PoodLL user had experienced the same need.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Daniel, It depends on which version of Moodle you are using and even then would need testing to make sure you have things set up right. I have tried this with an essay question and a PoodLL question in a quiz, and it works. Create the quiz, then in Quiz administration click on Permissions . Scroll down to Activity: Quiz and find Grade quizzes manually . Click the + and add Student . In my testing, students were able to see and grade only their own quiz. The teacher was able to see and grade them all.\nComment 2: It works! Thank you. I've been trying to find out how to do this for ages. I'm very happy.  This will add a great deal of value to the activities I want to use it in and for the students on my course. Thank you.\nComment 3: Off hand, I can't remember which version of Moodle it was where they gave us the capability to modify the permissions for individual activities like this. The nice thing is the same \"trick\" of changing permissions for an activity works with other activities too, but you do have to be VERY CAREFUL as they do not necessarily limit a student to seeing and grading ONLY their own entries. Just as a personal reminder, on the few occasions that I've used this trick, I have added something to the activity name and description, such as \"Self graded\" just to make sure I don't accidentally duplicate and use it when and where I shouldn't.\nComment 4: Thanks. That's a useful tip. It will also help students differentiate between quizzes that are self-graded and auto-graded.\nLabel: ",

I waited for almost 8 hours and it never loaded the success page. After failled install event when I close and try to log back into the site I get an internal server error and have to install a recent backup of the site before moodle will work again. To start off I changed to max execution time and other parameters and followed all the steps in getting started docs. I do not know how to debugging in moodle yet am learning from reading the docs on that right now. but want to know if this is a known problem with a fix available\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Lee That does not sound good. The most common problem is the need to raise the max execution time. I think this is because we use the Amazon AWS SDK in Poodll, and Moodle does some verification on the code, and there is a lot of code. Can you check what the reported max execution time on your site is when you visit: Site admin -> server ->php info It should be 90 or more. If you really can't get past this, I am happy to look into it for you. But in that case you should start a ticket via https://poodll.com/contact . Then we will be able to share passwords etc in private.\nComment 2: I have started a ticket thank you\nComment 3: Lee, Justin,\n\nAny update on this issue? I was upgrading plugins in my MAMP test site and ran into the exact same issue once I tried to update Poodll. I don't have time at the moment to setup my MAMP test site at the moment but I was definitely surprised (and good to know). Running 3.2.1+ with php 7.0.16.\nComment 4: I wanted to add that I simply swapped out the Poodll package after downloading the zip, unzipping the folder, and replacing the contents so I'm not sure why there is any timeout issue. Just tried again with debugging turned on at my work MAMP set up: Fatal error : Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in C:\\MAMP\\htdocs\\courses\\lib\\classes\\plugin_manager.php on line 2214\nComment 5: I hate feeling like I'm spamming the forum but I just wanted to say I was able to successfully install the update after changing the php.ini max execution time to 120 in my MAMP set up. Of course, it was instant as it normally has been under the 30 s default setting. Keep up the great works. I noticed the erroneous S3 error so glad to see it addressed (wasn't an issue really anyway).\nComment 6: I am glad that raising the max execution time solved it. And thanks for reporting back. This doc explains how to set the max execution time in a bit of detail: https://poodll.com/poodll-3-docs/increasing-phps-max_execution_time/\nLabel: ",

I'm wondering if anyone might be able to help me. Some students created a Poodll video with their ipads which converted properly and was visible when the students posted it to a forum (Moodle 3.2). I saw the video playing. However, now it isn't visible. All that shows in the forum window is \"upfile_468814434.mov\". In the html I can see \"<p><img src=\"https://XXXXXX.XXXXXX.xxxxxxx.ac.jp/draftfile.php/5/user/draft/851821148/upfile_468814434.mov\" alt=\"upfile_468814434.mov\">\" which means it should be showing doesn't it? If someone could point me to what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it I'd be most grateful. Kind regards, Eric\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Eric As a super Poodll 3 guy you can, and probably should, send support requests via the contact form at https://poodll.com/contact or send email directly. The reason is that in Poodll 3 there is a support info file that you can generate. That tells me all your versions and settings, and it speeds things up. Find that at: site admin -> plugins -> filters -> poodll -> support info ( I think its probably best not to attach it to forum posts. ) To answer your question. It sounds like \"cloud recording\" is off. In that case the mov file has not been sent to the Poodll cloud conversion service. So it is stuck a mov file. Try turning on \"cloud recording\" on the Poodll filter general settings page. This is really the best thing to do. You could maybe play ,mov file back as is.  As long as the player selected was good with mov files. You could try the Media Element Video player in Poodll. This page explains how to set up Video JS, but the principles are the same for Media Element Audio. https://poodll.com/poodll-3-docs/video-js/ Finally there is a Poodll App these days. Read about that here, https://poodll.com/poodll-3-docs/using-the-poodll-mobile-app/ That makes it easier to record audio/video off iOS devices. But it also works best with cloud recording. So you should have that enabled.\nLabel: ",

Question is: How Moodle will understand which file to be deleted and which file should keep?\nComment 3: Each file is stored in a file area that is associated with a context . So for example, when an assignment submission is deleted, any files in file areas associated with that context and item id are deleted (or marked for deletion). So if you save files in the way that Moodle expects , Moodle will handle all that stuff for you.\nLabel: ",

Thank you\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Mohammad, What is the operating system on the server? Is the audio/video file being uploaded into Moodle on the server. If so, more than likely, it is your web server user that needs the permission. For instance, my server is running CentOS 7 and apache is the web server user that has to have permission to write files.\nComment 2: Hi AL, First files are saving in the remote server ( Ubuntu ) then copied to moodle, later delete files from ubuntu server. The security risk is to write files on Ubuntu server, It needs admin user. Mvh Kabir\nComment 3: Why not see about creating a repository in your Moodle data directory and put the files there, or try using something like Drop Box?\nComment 4: The files are being written by Red5. So the user running Red5 needs to be able to write the files. To run on a port lower than 1024, by default you need root permissions I think. I am not an expert on that. But apache on your Moodle server will be just the same. So whatever is doable/acceptable there, should be possible on the Ubuntu server too. The directory to which the files are written only needs to be owned or writeable by  Red5.\nLabel: ",

Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: This just has not been setup to be configurable unfortunately. Currently the snapshot is taken using mostly the same settings for the video camera. Possibly increasing the web camera capture size in the poodll filter settings will give you a bigger picture, but that will affect PoodLL video recorders elsewhere in your site too. Note also that the web camera capture size options may or may not be supported by the web camera, so you need to test it a bit.\nComment 2: Thank for your reply. I try to configure as you say: Video Player Settings: Video Player width: 800 Video Player height: 600 Web Camera Settings: Video Recorder Capture Size 800x600 I don't see other settings. I try but the snapshot size (moodle modal) is always the same.\nComment 3: I have nothing else to suggest right now.

We are running moodle 3.0.5+ on RHEL 6 with postgres DB We have installed the following PoodLL plugins: Filter ( 2.8.6(Build 2016061600)) Recording ( 2.6.0(Build 2015121100)) Assignment Submissions ( 1.5.9 (Build 2015121101)) Feedback ( 1.0.6 (Build 2015121101)) I noticed a number of warnings in the error log: [Wed Aug 17 16:42:40 2016] [error] [client x.x.x.x] File does not exist: /ROOT-DIRECTORY/moodle/mod/assign/skinvolumemeter.png, referer: https://SERVERNAME/moodle/mod/assign/view.php [Wed Aug 17 16:42:40 2016] [error] [client x.x.x.x] File does not exist: /ROOT-DIRECTORY/moodle/mod/assign/plainskinbackground.png, referer: https://SERVERNAME/moodle/mod/assign/view.php Is there some configuration issues we missed? Also, when we attempted to submit an audio assignment, the recorder would appear, the audio would be recorded and could be listened to but when submitted, the recorder showed up again on screen and the page was still loading (spinning).  I noticed a brief glance of some debug information and realized that moodle was set to debug email sending.  If I stopped the page, and went back to view the assignment, the audio was uploaded and working (blue flow player).  When I turned the debug off, it appeared to work. Also, for some reason, a tester indicated that they were unable to use the recorder but then it started working.  I know this is minimal information but is it possible that cache needed to be cleared or permissions for player needed to be accepted? Any advice would be appreciated.  If I have more additional comments, I will add them. Thanks Eric\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Eric Sorry for the slow reply. Those error messages about .png files can be ignored and they are annoying. I think I removed those in the latest version. The other issues are a bit hard to pin down. Sometimes debug and other output can get mixed up in what should be meaningful ajax responses and even into the recorded files themselves. Of course this shouldn't really happen but I have seen it before. I would consider this not a likely cause of the other problems you reported. There are many ways recording can fail, let me count the ways The recording timed out during upload The user's mic device is not recognized or not available The user has not given permission via various popup dialogs to access mic device The recording can't be uploaded due to bandwidth or network issues There are file permission issues on the PoodLL files There is a bug in PoodLL somewhere There is not really a problem, but the user thinks there is The file is recording ok, but its in a format that can't be played back The PoodLL filter settings are to convert with FFMPEG but ffmpeg is not set up PHP security settings, mod-security or suhosin are killing the file upload And that won't be all of them. So its a bit of a minefield at times. Its most likely a permissions, network or device issue. Try really short recordings, and see if they work. If they do, and big long ones don't, then try using the red5 audio recorder (ie not the mp3 one).\nComment 2: Hello all, I do not think I could explain the error so I used Snagit to create a video/audio capture.  The url is: https://portico.concordia.ca/katcher/poodll/ I will try to message you with the username and password to access the video.

For instance, if it is an Assignment with submission type set for Online PoodLL, just select Download all submissions from the grading page, and you will get a zip fill with all the PoodLL files in it. If you're like me and put recordings all over the place, then you might need to be using the player that gives you a download button.\nComment 2: What if it's a Quiz type activity? Can I also just select Download all submissions from the grading page?\nComment 3: I want to do is to download the files recorded and maybe delete afterwards to lessen the space in the LMS. Thanks AL.\nComment 4: There is no central way to manage PoodLL recordings yet. Al's answer is about the best you can do. In the PoodLL filter settings if you switch on \"show download icon beside player\", you should get a download button. And when you reset a course or delete an activity, presumably Moodle performs housekeeping on the files on that course or activity\nComment 5: Hi Justin, You answered while I was doing some testing, as I knew it would work for assignments, but was only pretty sure that the download button was the only way to go with quiz questions. @Mark, If you are wanting to have an easy way for your students to make PoodLL recordings and for you to be able to easily delete them , there are other ways to do this. The Atto PoodLL Anywhere buttons will let you do recordings in the forum, database , glossary, newest version of journal, or just about anywhere you can use the Atto editor. All of those options allow for easy deletion. If you also install the PoodLL repository plugin, then you can also do recordings with the Podcast (pcast) plugin, which was my favorite way of having students submit recordings.\nComment 6: Hi Justin, Al Thank you so much for answering my question. Appreciate it a lot. Have a great day!\nLabel: ",

I am evaluating Poodll in a self hosted virtual instance of Moodle, and have found that although small mobile video files under 10MB will generally upload via Poodll and play back without issue on the source device, once the file size exceeds roughly 15-20MB, then things start to fall apart. Background... My use case requires that all students will be submitting assignments via mobile device platforms, which if I understand correctly would be best served by converting submissions via FFMPEG for widest mobile platform compatibility. Therefore, I have built FFMPEG on my test server from sources, and have verified that when called from the system path, it is working correctly. I have also verified via shell command that the FFMPEG switches used on the poodll demo site are working. Therefore, I assume that the Poodll Filter settings to auto convert mobile submissions to MP4 and to use FFMPEG for the conversion are also working, although I have yet to determine how to verify this as I have not seen any entries in any server logs. Back to the problem at hand... Without FFMPEG settings enabled in the Poodll filter, files of any size, up to the server limit of 512MB, will upload from a mobile device without issue. Playback is choppy over mobile data, but plays smoothly via WiFi, suggesting that playback quality is bandwidth dependent. With FFMPEG conversion settings enabled in the Poodll filter, mobile uploads above approximately 15MB in size will cause a browser error on Chrome, or will simply never complete the upload process in Firefox . In Chrome, after selecting a mobile video larger than 15MB to upload, the progress bar never appears and within about 15 seconds Chrome will throw an \"Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage...\" error. In Firefox, after selecting a mobile video to upload larger than 15MB, the progress bar will appear, but no indication of upload activity will be evident and the process never completes. Obviously, in both cases Mobile uploads will fail. Since it is possible to turn on the mobile upload processing error, and turn it off, by enabling and disabling the FFMPEG conversion settings in the Poodll filter, I assume that the root issue is with the filter and not my environment, but I would appreciate some other perspectives or troubleshooting  suggestions on the matter. Moodle is running on a Debian (Jesse) instance, with 2GB of RAM, 60GB HD, and PHP.INI settings that allow up tp 512MB uploads and 640MB of script memory. Regards; Michael\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Michael Make sure that transcoding is going on in the background (there is a switch for that on the settings page). This will mean that the browser won't wait for the transcoding to finish. It relies on cron to kick off the transcoding. So it won't start till cron runs. Though it does sound like the real issue is with uploading. There are settings that affect uploads on your web server. Apache mod_security and the PHP extension suhosin are two of those. I would look into that. Both of those by default limit the size and nature of uploads.\nComment 2: Thank you Justin; I have tried mobile submissions with the Background trans-coding option enabled and disabled, with no noticeable difference. So I will enable it again, but as you suggest the problem is likely to be elsewhere. I will investigate mod_security and suhosin. Hopefully I can find some clues there. Regards, Mike Somerville\nComment 3: Hello Justin; I guess I should have known this already, but Suhosin and Mod_Security are not installed on my Debian virtual server. Can you think of any other areas/log files that I can inspect to continue troublshooting?\nComment 4: Sorry Michael, I will reply to your email today. I apologize for the delay. It sounds like you are hitting some sort of upload limit. The usual suspects are suhosin and mod_security. In php.ini there are also: memory_limit upload_max_filesize post_max_size Apparently the values of those should follow this pattern: upload_max_filesize =< post_max_size =< memory_limit So the simple way is to make them all the same, but upload_max_filesize should never be greater then post max_size, which should never be greater then memory_limit. I am not an expert in this, though I have learned the hard way about some of it. Another thing you might try is recording over at https://demo.poodll.com . This is using the new PoodLL3 and Amazon S3 for uploads. If that all works for you, perhaps PoodLL3 would be a good solution\nLabel: ",

PoodLL has had great uptake from the Moodle community and the users have been positive through the good times, and patient and understanding through trouble times. So going premium is not something I have taken likely. At its heart is the reality that PoodLL needs a lot of work to make the full transition to HTML5 and for a host of other feature improvements and better support options (incl. documentation). You can read more on an this here: http://poodll.com/?p=2107 It will be available as an annual subscription with 3 tiers of membership: i) individual teacher (aka little guy) ii) single institution/organization iii) partner The pricing and some other details are yet to be decided, but from now on there will be more no more updates published on Moodle.org or the existing GitHub repositories, other than bug and security fixes. In the past I maintained a mailing list of PoodLL users, but these days that list doesn't contain the large majority of users. So currently there is no direct way for me to communicate with the PoodLL user base.  It would be very helpful for me if as a PoodLL user you could take this quick 8 question survey. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/63DJ529\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Justin, I wish you well with this.  I am sure it will be a success, and I think such developments are inevitable, with or without what we may call \"official\" support from MoodleHQ. On a completely different but related matter, I was reminded of the thread earlier on plugins.  I am still of the opinion that alongside the plugin/premium ecosystem we have talked about, we need a \"Givealittle\" style option. I found my post from 17th June here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=314916#p1263153 I think I will give this a little bump. My view remains unchanged: \" As a first off, I'd like someone to make it easy for us to \"give a little\" to any developer with a plugin in the database .  Quite apart from any of the complex plans and programmes you have thought about\" I will watch developments with interest Justin. -Derek\nComment 2: Thanks Derek. I think thats a good initiative, and I hope Moodle HQ implement it. For myself personally I found taking donations got very tricky because Paypal stopped doing donation buttons in Japan. Something on the plugins database would be nice\nComment 3: Hi Justin, I can understand and sympathise with your thinking. Having read through the discussion you cited, I'd certainly subscribe to the \"pay the developer directly\" camp.  I would be very unhappy at the prospect of paying into a pool which gets distributed by someone else. I hope that you get enough institutions on board to allow you to keep the price very low for individual teachers - they are the ones who don't have the IT backup to get round the problems that your plugins solve so elegantly! All the best Andy\nComment 4: Thanks Andy. Pricing is going to be tricky, but I definitely want to keep it affordable for teachers. J\nComment 5: Any rough time frame for the next release? HTML5 recording is important to us.\nComment 6: HTML5 recording will likely be ready December I think. There will be some releases along the way though I hope.\nComment 7: Hi Justin Any update on PoodLL 3 May 2016 release?\nComment 8: We are shooting for July 14th (2016) Working hard. J\nComment 9: Exciting ;)\nComment 10: Now it's july 14th, and always nothing about poodll 3. I begin to be really exciting. Please stop to play with my nerves...\nComment 11: You are correct. And I apologise I am still making some changes and testing. It is not a good idea to announce a release date I realise now. Actually I am very pleased with how PoodLL3 is coming together. And it will be released in a day or two. But I think it would be wise to not install it on a production site just yet. I will prepare more information from now.\nLabel: ",

It all works flawlessly on Chrome and Edge, but on Firefox (v43.0.4, the latest one with the latest flash plugin), it doesn't work. I can start the recording (after giving Flash permission to use my microphone), I then proceed to stop it and I see an \"uploading\" spinning symbol, but when it finishes the recording hasn't been actually saved, nothing plays when I click on the play button of the plugin, or when I save the supposedly recorded audio and use the media player to listen to it. Not even if I submit the assignment. One thing I can tell is different from when I try this same action on Chrome and Edge is that on those browsers, while I speak, the volume bar in the plugin shows feedback (with green and red bars), while on Firefox that doesn't happen. I've been able to test this in a couple computers running Windows 10 and the latest version of Firefox, both with exact same results. In those same computers, using Chrome or Edge works fine. Is this some sort of bug in Firefox (or the plugin) not actually enabling the microphone? Any way around it? Thanks so much in advance for any feedback, this plugin is awesome! Edit: I forgot to mention that I also tried with the audio submission example in the Poodll demo site ( http://demo.poodll.com/mod/assign/view.php?id=87&action=view ) with same exact results, so it's not something related to my Moodle site or my server ...\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Albert, We had the same problem with the audio recorder. Try going into your Firefox' \"Add-ons\" >  \"Plugins\" and go to the \"Options\" for the \"Shockwave Flash\" plugin. There should be a checkbox for \"Protected Mode\" or something similar. Uncheck it and try again with the audio recorder! This is rather unfortunate as Firefox gives a notice about the missing plugin without Flash - but then things only get worse after installing Flash, as now the recorder shows up but doesn't work.\nComment 2: The same problem with Firefox 44.0.2. \"Protected mode\" is unchecked but audio recorder doesn't work.

Mamadou\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: That is not the latest version of PoodLL.  However the later versions are only for Moodle 2.9 and greater. But even if you did upgrade you will still experience some of those problems. Files recorded on your device will not necessarily play back in the same device's browser. For example iPhone records mov files, and Android records different file types depending on the device model. But those are mostly rotten for use in a web environment. PoodLL can't do much about that, except to receive the recordings and then convert them to a better format. You will need to convert them using FFMPEG to a file format that can be played back generically. By email last year I sent you notes on the FFMPEG setup. The javascript whiteboards should work, but there were issues in Moodle 2.8 with Literally Canvas, so please try drawingboard.js. It is one of the options in the PoodLL filter settings. Regarding being logged out when trying to upload, I have heard of this but have not had a chance to look into yet. Justin\nComment 2: Hello Justin, Thanks for your feedback. will try the drawingboard.js. I'll look closely to the file you sent me (definitly forgot about that one oops ! ) There is something in the poodll-red5-webapp (as we are not using tokyo.poodll.com ) that is not compatible with the mp4 conversion in moodle When we activate the ffmpeg conversion for videos in moodle server and we use flash recording to our red5 server,  poodll tries to download from red5 server a mp4 file but it does not call the conversion function before. so there is a flv file but no mp4 file. And I didn't see any error message. we just notice that when accessing to the course that we cannot se the video. We are going to upgrade in april to moodle 3 do you know if  the last version of poodll will be compatible with it. And sorry i didn't answer your last email. I was working on something else and as we are about to update i didn't know if your proposal would be very useful for us. have a nice day Mamadou\nLabel: ",

But until I can test it more, that is the only thing I can suggest.\nComment 2: I think this may have been fixed in yesterdays release 2.8.5(2015121106). Please try.\nComment 3: I just having a try : Drawing Board(js) : do nothing Literrally Canvas(js) : just show me a big grey square but I can't draw something Poodll Whiteboard(Flash) : I can see whiteboard and draw something but when i try save my drawing, it don't work. I try to activate and desactivate Poodll Filter; put it on the first place of all plugin filter of moodle; Purge all caches of Moodle again. Nothing work.\nComment 4: Its quite mysterious. If you have any interesting looking errors in your browser console, that might help. Is it just whiteboards, eg do audio recorders work in the question?\nComment 5: Sorry but I have no error message on my browser.\nComment 6: Today in the error log of my servor, i find this kind of lines after I have a new try with the whiteboard of poodll. [Tue Jan 19 08:16:33.207128 2016] [:error] [pid 8342] [client xx.xx.xx.xx:55681] SoftException in Application.cpp:256: File \"/home/bacelecc/public_html/EEEC/filter/poodll/poodllfilelib.php\" is writeable by group, referer: http://www.bac-elec.com/EEEC/filter/poodll/flash/scribblesubmit.lzx.swf9.swf?debug=false Is it possible to change the value of the parameter debug? After perhaps i can have more information about the trouble.\nComment 7: I think i have solved the problem. \"SoftException in Application.cpp:256\" is a error permission access poodllfilelib.php have a permission 666. I change it to 644 and now it's ok I can see the answer when I test the whiteboard question. I must have some try with my students, to know if the problem is definitively solved or not.\nComment 8: Thank a lot for your help, now all is return to normal.\nComment 9: Thanks so much for not giving up and for reporting the problem back here. I think there might be a problem with permissions on my side because several people have reported issues recently. I will look into it as soon as I can. Justin\nLabel: ",

Since then I haven't seen anything on this issue.  With the release of Moodle 3.0, this becomes a bit more pressing.  I've nothing against the premium concept, and given how important I find Poodll, I'm principally in favour of the move.  But I would like to know what the situation is. For example, will the current version (which I understand will not be actively supported in future) still work with future Moodle versions?  I guess ony Justin can answer this, but for many people this could be important. Has anyone tried  Poodll with 3.0?  Have there been any issues? Given that a lot of language teachers rely on Poodll in their courses, it would be nice to have an update so that the planning can begin. (If I have missed an article/post about this, then I apologise and would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.) All the best Andy\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Andy Yes it has become a bit pressing. I will release some information later this week. Justin\nComment 2: I aim to have a Moodle 3 version of PoodLL ready by the end of next week, ie Friday Dec 3rd. \"PoodLL Premium\" is on its way, but that won't be it. So it should be available on Moodle.org as usual. Apologies for the delay.\nComment 3: So far so good. But the whiteboards are still holding out on me. Once those are done I will release it. Be aware that the PoodLL filter has had a major refactor. That means that every single PoodLL mod will need to be updated at the same time.\nLabel: ",

On audio/video recording, how it works?  Which audio/video devices the pooDLL filter use? Any documentation on this on the forum, or pooDLL site? Maadis\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Its a pretty broad question. The audio/video server is a Red5 Server. It records direct from a flash recorder and saves the recording locally. Later Moodle download s the recording from there into the Moodle data directory. It is not used for audio recordings made from mobile devices, or the MP3 recorder. Those just involve the browser and Moodle.\nLabel: ",

But what should you check when it happens? Well first of all its a general error. And it tells you/the student that your recording will not be saved. That is important. At this point your recording is already gone. There is probably nothing you can do but re record. Things to check i) is the microphone capturing sound? Or the video camera capturing your picture. If not, then there is nothing to submit or convert. And you might get this error. ii) does a very short recording get submitted ok? Sometimes longer recordings have problems at the server or browser level. iii) what recorder are you using? The two audio recorders look similar but are completely different. The video one is different again but in terms of troubleshooting its identical to the red5 audio recorder. MP3 recorder: recordings get less reliable as they get longer. Best not to venture over 2 mins. conversion to MP3 happens before the upload . If the file is too big it might spin forever and give up if the upload begins but throws an error, the connection to the Moodle server is problematic. Check the browser console for errors related to the file being posted. Some servers restrict the upload file size. Thats a whole new ball game, but if thats the case small uploads will be working. audio recorder/video recorder (red5): if you can't play it back after recording.... then the file never arrived on the Red5 server. Check the connection lamp on the recorder. Should be green. If its red or yellow your connection is bad (firewall? ) or the red5 server is down (happens.) If you can play it back, but get the error message above ... then the problem is that your file can't be collected from the Red5 server and copied back into Moodle. Turn off auto convert to mp3/mp4 in the filter settings and try again (or uncheck the mp3/mp4 checkbox on the recorder BEFORE recording). If conversion is the issue then its best to set up FFMPEG on the Moodle server and have PoodLL do its magic with that. Check the port settings in the PoodLL filter settings for HTTP. Your Moodle server will need to be able to do a server to server connection to that port on the  Red5 server to pick up the recorded file.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Justin, I have a student who claims the PoodLL MP3 recorder does not pick up his microphone (which, he claims, works fine otherwise). He can save recordings, but they have zero length and thus do not play. He claims to have tried different browsers, different microphone settings and has the latest version of Flash. Can you give a suggestion as to what I might look into. The others in the course manage to record. Rgrds, Paul.\nComment 2: I think your student has probably unwittingly denied permission to the recorder to access the microphone. Depending on the browser there are two places permissions need to be granted. Flash will show a permissions dialog which can be reshown by right clicking over the recorder and selecting \"settings\" or \"properties\". Chrome and other browsers may have their own permissions dialogs which will be shown after flash tries to access the mic. Other things to check might include that the microphone is plugged in, or if there are multiple microphones in the machine, that the correct one is selected. (again right click ->settings and choose the microphone tab ). Occasionally it is necessary to mess with the microphone tab settings there to spark the microphone into action. I do not know why. Flash is a black box in that regard.\nLabel: ",

I save it and whenever I go to play it back, I usually only get an audio clip of 4 to 12 seconds long, even if the recording was a minute or two. Does anyone have any suggestions or solutions?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I have seen this before, and I am trying to recall what caused it. It may be a PHP thing called Suhosin interfering with your uploaded audio data. Go to site admin -> server ->php info. Do a search (ctrl + f) for 'suhosin' and also look at 'post_max_size' and 'upload_max_filesize.' If suhosin is there, it is the most likely culprit. And you will need to configure it to accept larger upload sizes. If its not there, then its nor the problem. If either of the other 2 values are really small, ie less than 2M, then that might be the problem. But thats unlikely.\nComment 2: I checked to see if suhosin was there but it's not. The post_max_size and upload_max_filesize are both 1024M. It's strange because the video recorder for example works perfectly. I've recorded up too 3 minutes of video and it all comes up when it's saved.\nComment 3: The Video and Red5 audio recorders work very differently to the MP3 recorder. So its not so surprising the behaviour is different. The MP3 recorder posts the data to the server, which the other recorders don't do. Something is truncating the uploaded data. I am not sure what is doing it, but anything that limits the upload file size would be something to look at. If it works for you, you might try using the Red5 audio recorder as a workaround\nComment 4: I'll give the Red5 recorder a try but I seem to remember a similar problem with it. When you say server, do you mean the tokyo.poodll.com server? Do you think installing FFMPEG might help with this issue?\nComment 5: Installing FFMPEG , and configuring PoodLL to use it, is a good thing to do. But that is really about file conversion. And I don't think that is a solution to this problem. Something is limiting the file upload size on your Moodle server. There is no \"upload\" from browser to Moodle server when using tokyo.poodll.com. The browser uploads to tokyo.poodll.com. And then your Moodle server downloads it from there. That is why it is unaffected.\nComment 6: Ok, that makes sense. I'll talk to our Moodle host and ask them to investigate if there's something limiting the upload size. Thanks for your help Justin, it really is a great plugin.\nLabel: ",

As a result PoodLL recording stopped working (only the whiteboard still functions, probably because it does not use Flash). This tells me it is probably the upgraded filter that is responsible rather than the Moodle upgrade, because it affects PoodLL anywhere as well as PoodLL in the assignment and other places. On the other hand, it still works in the PoodLL database field. This is puzzling. Rgrds, Paul.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Paul, thanks for the report.

Rgrds, Paul.\nComment 3: Paul, I tested today on a Moodle 2.9 install and while there are still issues with the whiteboards,  the recorders should be ok. Perhaps the error is to do with settings or networking?\nComment 4: Hi, We installed PoodLL after upgrading to Moodle 2.9. Audio is working well but we are having trouble with the video recording and upload . The first time I record video on a computer, it works great. This has been the same for 3 users at 3 different locations. Any browser works. The second time I try, I can record but it never finishes the upload process...if I let the computer sit, the uploading spinner just continues to spin but never completes, no matter how long or short the video is. We are all selecting .mp4 as video output. I moved the PoodLL filter above multimedia plugins when I did the installation. I have read that the text cache lifetime is no longer an issue for 2.9.1 (Build 20150806) I purged all caches today but to no avail. I have searched high and low for others with this issue and this is the only one I have seen with a similar video recording issue. Thank you for any suggestions you can send my way. Blair\nComment 5: There seems to be an issue with tokyo.poodll.com.

One of the biggest problems is that it was very confusing for students because they couldn't tell if their audio actually submitted, as no notification was given, and after saving, they can't see the file there, or listen back to it. The instructor had the same problem in leaving voice feedback for students. Is there anyway for students and instructors to listen to files after they've been submitted? Or for instance if an instructor uses PoodLL to give feedback and two weeks later wants to hear it to remember what they said can they? Currently that doesn't seem available.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Clint That should certainly be possible. I wonder how you are doing these things. Perhaps you are doing it a different way than most, or the recording is not working at all. The recorder does allow you to playback the recorded file, and should display an \"uploading\" dialog. And after the page hosting the recorder has been saved, there should be a player (audio or video) in the feedback area for the student ( or on the submission summary if its an assignment submission). And when the teacher returns to the page they should see a recorder for re-recording and a player for listening to the existing feedback recording. If none of that is happening, it should be, and so there is some problem at your end.\nLabel: ",

I am interested in the community's feedback on Poodll's usability and functions for people who are visually or hearing impaired. Putting aside the complications of audio and video assignments and feedback for a moment (we know we have a lot of work to help class members and instructors provide accessible content for each other ), please comment on the usability of the tools themselves. From the videos I am seen of Poodll in action the buttons and links appear as accessible or inaccessible as any other Moodle module.  Do you or your users report a different experience? Thanks for your thoughts. Robin Sitten Perkins eLearning\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Robin, it would be interesting indeed to see what others have to say on this. But I have to say that it is probably not the best news. I battled for some time to make the buttons visible to screen readers and in the end found that it was not going to work ... because of limitations of the framework I originally wrote the recorders in. Though it did not occur to me then, since that time I have found a way around those limitations and have implemented it in one of the recorders. Basically by hiding the flash widget and handling all user interaction via html buttons and javascript a far more accessible interface can be made. Effectively we are introducing skinning to PoodLL. It is just a matter of finding the time, to get it all done. But accessibility goes beyond just screen readers, so any comments or advice would be welcome.\nComment 2: Hi Robin, I was just browsing information about Poodll on Moodle.or and found your post and one other which didn't seem to address the issue. I've been working on Poodll in Moodle 2.8 and found that this plugin is not accessible. When I ran the NVDA screen reader and also sent a sample to our disability officer which is blind, he was unable to detect the player. The screen reader bypasses this alltogether. I will be sending a request to the developers to review this plug in and help us to comply with WCAG 2.0. Cheers, Nora Colazzo\nComment 3: You are right that much of it is not accessible. Luckily its not far away for the most popular of the components however. I was able to introduce full skinning for the MP3 audio recorder last month, thanks to \"The Learning Factory\" in Brazil. That makes adding accessibility to the MP3 recorder relatively simple. The other recorders require similar work, but at least we have a pattern to go with. The part that is not simple in all this for me, is exactly what the normal/desired behaviour of an screen reader, especially when it encounters an audio recorder. I was quite puzzled when I was testing with JAWS previously.\nLabel: ",

But in firefox , recording works only if check off and check on back \"reduce echo\". Please guide. Ps: Hi Justin : Sorry to be bothering but i hope you can help me out this time too. Also, Can you inform the per-requisite browser plugins needed for poodll recording type question ? For some users, it shows a blank \"plugin needed to be installed\" message. Regards.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Users just need Adobe Flash version 10 for audio recording. Try this page from Firefox: http://www.onlinemictest.com/ Is the situation the same (ie you need to turn on and off \"reduce echo\")?\nComment 2: I tested on the given site. The \"line\" moves without turning on and off the echo. Ps: On Chrome there is a separate popup for \"Allowing microphone and camera\" that comes up once on the given site and also for the poodll recording type question. On chrome, after clicking allow on this popup a red symbol flashes on the title of the browser all the while. On firefox this popup does not come up either for the given site or for poodll recording. ( This popup is in addition to the allow popup that comes up allowing audio from the site. I hope i am clear. ) Regards,\nComment 3: OK. There must be something going on with the PoodLL recorder(s). It might be related to the way we set the default camera and settings, from the filter settings. It might be that we are setting a value to the volume/gain that is actually setting it to 0. Or something like that. Anyway I will look at it, but it won't be right away.\nLabel: ",

I'm using Poodll on 2.7.2 and believe I have all the filters etc properly in place and working with Poodll above the mulimedia filter on the list of filters. When I record a video with my ipad it seems to go into the forum but then it appears as a black box with a play button on it. When I try to play it I receive an empty white box. That is on both the ipad and in firefox on a mac. Wondering if anyone else is having such problems or knows why I am? Sorry to bother you but would be most grateful for any assistance. Kind regards, Eric\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Eric I just tested it on the http://demo.poodll.com where it is working. I tried to reproduce the situation you describe by playing with a few settings, but I was unable to. So I think that most likely the cause of the problem is in the recording/ upload . Are you using PoodLL Anywhere on the Editor Toolbar (Atto or TinyMCE)? Or are you using the PoodLL Repository? Or are you doing something else? If you are using PoodLL to record/upload, does it state the file was uploaded successfully? Finally does doing a much shorter/smaller recording, of say 5 seconds, work?\nComment 2: Many thanks for getting back to me so quickly Justin, Are you using PoodLL Anywhere on the Editor Toolbar (Atto)? => It is on Atto. Or are you using the PoodLL Repository?  Not sure what this is but I think not. Or are you doing\nsomething else? Don't believe I am. If you are using PoodLL to record/upload, does it state the file was uploaded successfully?  => It does state the file was uploaded successfully. Finally does doing a much shorter/smaller recording, of say 5 seconds, work? => The tests I were doing were all 5 seconds or less. Recording from my mac worked but didn't from the ipad. Sorry to bother, but any other ideas would be very much appreciated.\nComment 3: If you are using PoodLL Anywhere for Atto, you are not using the repository, or \"anything else.\" The repository is the system you go through using the regular moodle media button (ie choosing from google docs, youtube, wikimedia, upload a file etc) You can use FFMPEG on your Moodle server to auto convert uploaded files to MP4. I am pretty sure you have not set up that, so I think we can ignore that avenue. Let me know if I am wrong though. So the files Moodle is attempting to play will be .mov files. Flowplayer should play those back fine. As of course, should the iPad. But I have seen it go wrong. I would really need to see the uploaded file to check. So here are two things to try. i) turn off the PoodLL filter, and try to reload the page and play the video. Does it work? If so, PoodLL is messing up the playback somehow. If it still doesn't play .. lets do ii) ii) Turn the poodll filter back on. And turn on \"show download link\" beside players  in the PoodLL filter settings. Then there should be a download link by the player when the page is loaded. Download the file to your desktop. Can you play it there? If not, can you post it to me here, or by email, so I can look at it?\nComment 4: Thanks again Justin, Will send you those this evening as I don't have wifi for my ipad at the moment. Sorry to bother you, and as always, many thanks. Eric\nComment 5: Good evening again Justin, I turned off the Poodll plugin and refreshed the screen on the ipad. This time I get a play button with a slash through it. Am sending you the file by mail as it won't play with quicktime or VLC. Thank you very much for your assistance. Eric\nComment 6: Eric That .mov file was empty, and that is the heart of the problem. I don't like asking you to jump through all these hoops, but here are two more. Sorry. Can you try the same thing into the \"forum(with video)\" activity on http://demo.poodll.com ? (login creds are on the front page ) If it works there, it is a server specific thingy we need to figure out. There might be an error in your logs. If you can find the error log that apache generates, check it and see if there are any recent errors that look related. It can be necessary to turn off or configure a thing called Suhosin. And your server's maximum file upload size could also be a part of the problem. If we are at this point and there is no good error in your server logs, it gets quite complicated unfortunately. If it doesn't work on demo.poodll.com I think that maybe PoodLL has in issue with receiving uploads from your ipad. One thing that I have seen occur, is when people select \"choose existing video\" from the popup dialog, rather than \"take a video.\" The uploaded file is compressed and this can cause problems with the browser/server interaction. The best reply right now to this is to recommend people select \"take a video.\"\nComment 7: A very good morning to you Justin, I've just firstly logged in as admin and created a forum, then as a student and tried to post with the ipad. Same situation as my server. Will try with another ipad soon. I was using an ipad air by the way. All the best and thank you again. Eric\nComment 8: Have now tried that with an ipad mini and a second generation ipad but same results. Upload limits are 2GB site wide and 50mb for the forum so shouldn't be the problem. Head scratcher...\nComment 9: Hold the bus! News just in. After upgrading to the latest OS 8.0.2 from 8.0.0 things are now working (though the video appears upside down!). Strange days are these, most peculiar mama but happy ones they are too! (As a side note to Justin, when I was trying to add video via Poodll in the Moodle app, the app would crash. Not sure if you are going there or not. Everything I did I tried first through Safari and then through the Moodle app. The moodle app would still crash when I clicked \"Take Video\" even after the upgrade.) Sorry to have troubled you Justin but thank you kindly for your efforts.\nComment 10: Well, that is good news. It just confirms what I already knew, that the whole mobile upload approach needs a rethink.  It is too fragile. I do plan to bring out an app, but its hard to make progress on that. Anyway its good news that iti s working.\nComment 11: I know that this is very late (happened upon it while reading about Poodll), but the upside-down video may just be that the ipad/iphone was being held \"upside down\" when taking the video. My understanding is that the camera has a definite orientation (Home button should be either down for portrait orientation or on right for landscape), but will flip the preview of the video or photo if held upside down. This flipping will continue if viewing the photo or video on an Apple device. When viewed on other systems - that don't read or understand the encoded \"flip this image\" instructions, the image is displayed as it was recorded - upside down. This became more of a problem when Apple enabled the volume buttons to act as the shutter release. This made it more natural to hold the phone with the shutter release (volume) on top - like a camera. Which is really upside-down. David\nComment 12: I started getting weirdness myself on iPhone iOS 8.0.0. After a bit of digging it indeed turns out there was a bug in Mobile Safari that was fixed in iOS 8.0.2 . After I upgraded, bingo it all worked again. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25790873/uploading-files-over-http-fails-on-ios-8-0-0-gm-safari So that is another thing to check when you have iOS uploading woes.\nLabel: ",

I tested audio input on an Android phone (4.1.2) and got a similar issue. Uploading an existing mp3 was OK. Using a voice recording app said that the generated mp3 uploaded successfully, but Flowplayer won't play it. General questions: When using the HTML5 recording for audio, the Red5 server isn't needed, correct? It's up to the device to provide a file of type audio, and if FFMPEG conversion is installed/configured, that's what translates an ogg or wav to mp3? Is audio likely to be problematic for iPads in the way Eric was experiencing in the other thread? Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Hilary. Yes, you are pretty much correct. Red5 is not used when recording with iPads and other mobile devices. The device usually has a \"record now or choose an existing file\" type of file upload dialog. That is out of our control. In the case of iOS there is no \"record audio\" option on that dialog. Just record video. And yes, that means it is hard to predict the file type that will be arriving, though in the case of iOS it is .mov. FFMPEG does the conversion if it is installed and configured. Most PoodLL/Moodles don't have it installed I suspect. Is Audio likely to be problematic, as in Eric's experience. All I can say is \"maybe.\"  As I said in that thread, I now feel that the file upload approach, at least in the way that I have implemented it, is too fragile. The possibility of a student having a device I have not tested on, or sending up a file that doesn't convert, or that doesn't make it through the upload , is quite real. I hope to re work things in the very near future, but for now I think we should assume that recording with mobile devices needs to be handled carefully.\nComment 2: Thanks, Justin, that's very helpful. So the issue seems to be that PoodLL calling FFMPEG is not working for me. I do have it installed on my server and it works from the command line. For example, I can transform an ogg file to mp3. However, when I submit the same file via a quiz, it shows conversion (\"Saved: upfile_146395184.mp3\"), but the result won't play in flowplayer. When I dig into the actual file location from the hash table, it's still the ogg file (original size, & if I download & add .ogg it plays, .mp3 won't). The phone voice recorder app creates .amr files; same thing, I can translate with ffmpeg, but what PoodLL names .mp3 and stores seems to still be the amr file. I know this is labeled experimental, but is there something simple I could be missing, like file permissions? It's strange that the conversion does actually work on the one hand, and PoodLL seems to think it has successfully performed it on the other, but the result is not saved. thanks!\nComment 3: Hmm, more info... I've done testing with .mov files, and those convert and store fine! (file in filedir matches size of the manually-converted mp3) The files submitted as .ogg and .amr play on the device when reviewing the quiz. It's the non-mobile flowplayer that chokes on them.\nComment 4: Well. That is interesting. If the mov files convert to mp3 correctly. We would expect that the ogg and amr files should also. The conversion process is the same throughout PoodLL. So it is possible to do the testing for this outside the quiz. If you turn on \"show download link beside players\" in the PoodLL filter settings, a little download arrow will show beside the player. Even if you don't download, rolling your mouse over it should show you the url in your browser status bar. So you will see if it has in fact been converted by noting the file extension. PoodLL will first try to use the FFMPEG that it finds in the [Moodle]/filter/poodll directory. If it doesn't find one there, it will assume there is one available on the path and just bravely call \"ffmpeg -i blahblah.flv blahblah.mp3\" . So it is possible that the ffmpeg you are testing with and the one that PoodLL is using are not the same. It is also possible to set some parameters to the call to ffmpeg. The default is not to, but if you have some set and it might be that they work for mov but muff it for other filetypes. I have attached a document that I use to help people get up to speed with PoodLL and FFMPEG. See if anything in there helps. Also try it out on demo.poodll.com. If it works there, but not on your site, we might be able to see why. Justin\nComment 5: Hmm, very interesting comparing to demo.poodll.com and using the download link... everything seems to be exactly the same on both my site and poodll.com: The flowplayer won't play either the ogg>mp3 (displays total length 1 sec) or the amr>mp3 (length 0 sec). The link ends in mp3. Downloading the ogg>mp3 file results in a playable file. However, it is smaller (187KB) than the mp3 generated from the same file at the command line (196KB)--which is exactly the same size as the original ogg file. And actually I think it is still an ogg file... if I change the file extension it still plays in Windows Media, because I have the codec for ogg installed. Ahh, I uploaded it to TrID and that says it's indeed an .ogg. I'm attaching it, in case that helps. Downloading the supposed amr>mp3 file won't play as an mp3, but will if I change the file extension. TrID confirms it's still an amr. Also attached. .mov successfully converts to a genuine mp3, and plays in flowplayer. I tried to add \"-report\" in the mp3 options to get a log file on my server but can't get it working... On my server, ffmpeg is in /usr/share/, not in the PoodLL directory. But I installed it when installing PoodLL, so there's only one version to be called. It must be working in a similar fashion to the demo system, since on both .ogg and .amr don't work, but .mov does? If you get this/look at this before 9am, I'm users 06, 16, and 26 with submissions to the first audio assignment ( http://demo.poodll.com/mod/assign/view.php?action=grading&id=87 ). Thanks, Justin!\nComment 6: OK, I think I found the problem. Some file extensions were not getting converted properly. I updated the plugin, on github. Not yet on Moodle.org. Please try it and let me know if it works. https://github.com/justinhunt/moodle-filter_poodll Thanks.\nComment 7: Justin, you ROCK! It works perfectly. Much appreciated!\nComment 8: Hi, i try to record audio with a samsung tablet, and the extension it's *.ogg not cinto mp3 extension, with HTML 5 audio settings checked and Auto Conv. to MP3 settings checked too. With video recorder no problem all works fine, but with audio recorder I can't see the playback to play in it and listen the audio. The file has no extension into moodle... I have some mistake in the configuration settings but, no way! and It's very useful poodll for my moodle. Thanks in advance (I try to download the revisions files from github but seems that are more new the files from moodle.org, isn't it?)\nComment 9: The Github and Moodle.org version should be the same. I always select the Moodle.org version of a plugin from the github repository. Please you try this on http://demo.poodll.com and report back? If it works, its the config at your end. If not its something we might have to deal with in code. Thanks Justin\nLabel: ",

Also also, while I'm asking, is a once-video-player an option or something that might be in the future? These would be useful options for tests where the user is only allowed to view content once before answering questions.  (Yes, I realize that they can just refresh the page in many cases, but these options would be a step in the right direction.)\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Great questions Jeremy. I am aware of the need for much more functionality for the players. I have to hang my head and say that for the most part they won't do what you ask. My current plan is to redo the PoodLL players to use a completely different filter I have developed, that makes customizing them much easier. This is the video easy filter. But I will probably create a specific audio player version. If the language strings for the Once Player were customizable, would that be sufficient for now?\nComment 2: Indeed, moodle-filter_videoeasy looks far more powerful at first glance than the video player in poodll...  Do you have plans to incorporate the \"Play Once\" functionality somehow? I don't want you to pursue this issue with Poodll if it is your intention to make the media players obsolete.  I'd rather see you work on videoeasy and make it the best darn media filter available.  ;) In the meantime, I have hacked together a solution for videos using jQuery that manipulates the HTML video object - it basically auto-plays the video, hides the controls and disables right-click functionality.  This still doesn't address page refreshes, but I believe the only way to track that is to have the user's current playhead location saved to the database somehow every few seconds.  (I have implemented this kind of functionality on another non-Moodle site in the past and it works nicely... but I digress.)  The solution may lie in the ability to add custom JavaScript to your new 'templates'. For the audio-only playonce scenarios I am using Mat Bury's old .swf file and manually crafting the <object> tags in the content.  Not elegant, but it's working and no text strings to deal with...\nComment 3: yes \"play once\" comes up quite often, but it never seems worth as much trouble as it would take to develop the full implementation. For the once player I was planning on just implementing some custom controls for the HTML5 player. I would make a \"onceaudio\" VideoEasy template, and then that could be set as the player that handled MP3 in the context of that activity. It might even be more appropriate to make the template using the \"Generico Filter\" because then we wouldn't have to worry about owning the mp3 file extension. Hmmm, actually if you could share the code for the once player for video , I could at least make that one up in Generico. It would be a good starting point for the onceaudio player. What do you think?\nComment 4: Taking this code a step further to create custom controls would be pretty easy.  A simple \"Play\" HTML  button below or overlayed on top of the video could be customized by the user to say whatever they need, in whatever language. Here is the jQuery code I used.  It is not robust, in that it will take away the controls from every <video> object on the page and start playing them, but it is simple enough to modify the selector if there are multiple videos on the page, for example. First, the video is linked using Moodle's <A> method, and the default media filter converts it to a <video> tag. \n```text\n<a href=\"http://player.vimeo.com/external/VIDEO_ID.mp4?s=f586954a8dbb3f76de13aa\">My Video</a>\n```\n Insert this code in the HTML editor immediately after the video to remove the controls and begin playback: \n```text\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n\n\n  $(\"video\").prop(\"controls\", false);  // hide the controls\n\n\n  $(\"video\").get(0).play();  // play the video\n\n\n  $(\"video\").bind('contextmenu', function(e) { return false; });  // disable right-click\n```\nComment 5: Thanks lets me have a go at my end and see what I come up.\nLabel: ",

To do this, after you have copied the PoodLL modules, make sure you are logged in as admin, and click “notifications” in the site administration block. Moodle should recognize that several plugins need installing. It will recognize four new mods(filter, assignment type, question type and repository) and guide you through several install pages.\" Problem is Moodle hasn't recognised the plugins and I can't get on with the rest of the set up that follows this initial upload. Do I need to move any of the plugin folders somewhere else from the poodllall_2013022200 folder I've uploaded. Any pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Maybe slightly mis-read: \" upload and unzip the folder IN Moodle's main directory\" I think is what it should say. I'll bet if you look in the unzipped poodllall_2013022200 folder, you'll see folders like mod, block, etc..  And if you look in those you'll see something like poodllmod or poodllblock, etc.  It's the folders at that level that need to be moved to mod, block, etc.. Then one goes to notifications. Unzip the original zip locally first into a 'test' directory and see the results. 'spirit of sharing', Ken\nComment 2: Have you checked that the permissions on the folders are ok once they are in the right place? If they are still read only as sometimes seems to happen when uploading they will not be recognised. Richard\nComment 3: Carl I replied to your email. But just for anyone else who might run into this. It is a pretty common pitfall. The PoodLL all file, after it is expanded contains four folders, they should be copied over the Moodle folders of the same name. Basically you are merging them. It is just a quick way to install all 6 mods. But you can just do it mod by mod, like this: i) poodll filter : [moodle]/filter - place \"/filter/poodll\" directory from zip ii) online poodll assignment(2.3/2.4) : [moodle]/ mod / assign / submission - place \"/mod/assign/submission/onlinepoodll\" directory from zip iii) poodll online assignment(2.2 ): [moodle]/ mod /assignment/type - place \"/mod/assignment/type/poodllonline\" directory from zip iv) poodll recording question : [moodle]/question/type - place \"/question/type/poodllrecording\" directory from zip v) poodll database field : [moodle]/ mod / data / field - place \"/mod/data/field/poodll\" directory from zip vi) poodll repository : [moodle]/repository - place \"/repository/poodll\" directory from zip I hope that helps.\nComment 4: Hi Justine Sorry, I forgot to thank you for the support you provided. It was a great help. I've just upgraded to 2.6 and am re-installing the PoodLL add-ons. I notice there are now 7 rather than the 6 you list here. Do I need Assignment types, Assignment feedback and Assignment submissions? Keep up the great work - your add-ons have transformed how I use Moodle! Carl\nComment 5: Thanks Carl (again) You probably no longer need the Assignment type for (old) Moodle 2.2 assignment. The 7th mod will be PoodLL Feedback  for the (new) assignment. It allows you to record your voice/video or draw pictures as feedback for your students.\nComment 6: Got it Justin, thanks!\nComment 7: Our Moodle version 2.7 (soon to be upgrading to 2.8) is running the complete Poodll plugin set.  Now that our Moodle installation has been upgraded beyond 2.6 (and the old Assignment 2.2 activity type has been disabled and retired), the assignment_poodllonline plugin seems to no longer be required.  Deleting the plugin results in a \"Missing from disk!\" message on the Plugins Overview page.  As there is no Uninstall link for this plugin, what is the recommended practice for removing the obsolete plugin and the notification message?  My only remaining holdout plugins are assignment_poodllonline (and APC, but that is on my test server ).\nComment 8: I do not know why there is/was no uninstall link. To be honest, I have never really had to uninstall it. Anyway this seems to work. If you run this SQL (make sure your table name is correct) and purge caches, the message should go away. DELETE FROM `mdl_config_plugins` WHERE `mdl_config_plugins`.`plugin` = 'assignment_poodllonline'; NB: This is after you have removed any old PoodLL assignments, and removed the plugin from the filesystem.\nComment 9: Thanks, that seemed to work well on my test server!\nComment 10: Hi, I think the information Justin gave only avoid Moodle to tell \"Missing from disk!\", this plugin no more \"registered\" in mdl_config_plugins. And as he said as NB, for a real good deletion of a plugin, you should : have the plugin files installed in your Moodle,  so you have the \"Uninstall\" link uninstall the plugin via the link then delete plugin files HTH , Séverin\nLabel: ",

How did you manage the wide variety of Android installs in Japan with regards to using the voice recording feature? It seems to me that every manufacturer has a different voice recording tool, and several of them do not appear to work with poodll correctly. Did you have every student install a specific voice recording app?  How did you manage those recordings. All my iOS device users are working perfectly, but the androids right now are really hit or miss.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Sadly I don't have a good answer for you. My own students were high school kids, and not allowed to use mobile phones at school. So I was not able to use a lot of the mobile stuff with them. I have a few sites, one of them http://recordmp3online.com , and I get more feedback from the sites and other PoodLL users. In general I just rely on the browsers file upload screen and the associated media recorders. I think its a challenge and more so now than before. It is cat and mouse trying to keep up with the devices. And you simply don't have one of each to test with. So I have decided that I need to have an app, and have one in the works. I had hoped to avoid requiring users to use an app, but I think it is inevitable. I hope the app will make it easier to do a lot of these things.\nComment 2: Hi Justin, I was just wondering if you were still working on this app? I ask as I tested with Android and could not get the assignment submission plugin to work at all either from the camera or using a pre-recorded video from the gallery. Thanks\nComment 3: I found I just did not have time to build the app. I got started and I am a bit annoyed at not following through on it. My eyes are bigger than my stomach ... or something like that. These days with android we can probably get away with all html5 , and that is part of the big PoodLL 3 development effort this year. Probably the most urgent thing really. Another big part of the PoodLL 3 development is re factoring the whole thing so that other developers can get in and use PoodLL APIs or help out with the development. I am working on getting some funding for PoodLL 3 at the moment. Fingers crossed.\nLabel: ",

The records are correctly uploaded and saved since I can play them back on computers. But It will not play back on smarphones (gs4). I am not sure if this problem is related to the poodll filter. In order to have the same player (HTML5) on both PC and smartphone, the setting \"HTML5 Playback\" is set to \"Always use HTML5\". \"Auto Conv. to MP3\" is set to \"yes\", \"Convert uploaded media with FFMPEG\" is set to \"yes\" and FFMPEG works when I try to convert using command line. The html5 player works properly on the poodll demo site when I use my smarphone. What could be responsible for this problem ? Moodle 2.5.7\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: A possible problem is trying to play back the audio file from an https url . Mobile browsers (mobile safari in particular) can be quite fussy about the certificates they accept. demo.poodll.com is not using https. This would be the first thing that I would check. If you are not running https, then try to actually download that file and confirm that it is in fact an MP3 file. Then upload it to demo.poodll.com and try playing it back from there. If it works there but not on your site, it seems likely to be a server /poodll configuration issue. If it does not play back on demo.poodll.com then it is some sort if issue with the file or how it is created.\nLabel: ",

The filepicker for assignments does not seem to work properly with android mobiles on our Moodle (Moodle version 2.5.7 and installed PoodLL plugins are all up to date). When i click on the \"Record or Choose File\" button nothing happens. I did some tests with smartphone/tablet on our moodle and on the PoodLL Demo Course: Tests on our Moodle with smartphone (Galaxy S4): -S4's Native browser (mobile theme mymobile): nothing happens -Chrome (mobile theme mymobile): nothing happens - Firefox (tablet theme instead of the mobile one): the filepicker works but it does not proposes the native voice recorder of the phone, only Dropbox / Video recorder (=video, not audio) / file explorer.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Damien Its a bit of a puzzle. The PoodLL running on the demo site is a wee bit ahead of the released version, but not too much in mobile upload area of things has changed. Two things to check. i) are there any javascript console errors when using your moodle/poodll with the S4 to record audio? https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console ii) does the S3 offer a sound recorder in the file dialog anywhere at all? Not all androids do. Justin\nComment 2: Hi Justin, On Androids, i) for cases where the sound recorder is not in the file dialog, is it possible to still record using MediaRecorder classes? ii) Is it possible to directly open the sound recorder app directly, from the Record button? Not sure where the appropriate file dialog invoke code is present in poodllresourcelib. Thanks! Udit\nComment 3: Sorry for the slow reply. Right now we are limited to working with what Android (and iOS) provides in the file upload dialog. I do not think it is possible to call on the SoundRecorder App and get back the sound. But it might be. I am not sure what you refer to by MediaRecorder classes. If you mean native APIs, no. If you mean HTML5 web apis, then it should be. It is something I have to hurry up and implement. But we are not there yet.\nComment 4: Sorry for the slow reply.

I was created a page with widget of poodle ( video recorder and audio recorder ) now i want to know the path of the recorded video or audio. 2..  And i want to create a page  or link in the left navigation for list out the students from database please help me ....\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: If you want to keep the recordings made with PoodLL you really need to do so in the context of an activity which can save submissions, ie an assignment (OnlinePoodLL Assignment Submission, or a quiz (poodll recording question) or a database activity (PoodLL Database Field). A page has no save button. So just inserting a widget won't leave the recording anyway. (At least not anywhere that is accessible. ) Although you can insert a recording widget in that way, you would only do so for activities where you didn't care to keep the recording. eg practising speeches.\nComment 2: Hmm. I suppose that didn't exactly answer the question. PoodLL saves the files using Moodle's file system API. So they go into the draft files area for the activity in question (NB a \"page\" has no draft files area when it is being viewed). When the activity is saved, the files are moved into the file area for that activity and submission. It is quite complex and you would need to read up on it all here: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/File_API Unfortunately there is no easy to find location on disk. As for generating a list of students, I can't answer that in a sentence. It is not really clear what you are trying to do.

Let me illustrate: Palette: electronic circuits Items available: MOSFET (four terminal), MOSFET (three terminal, body implicitly biased), wire (2 terminal), BJT (three terminal), resistor (two terminal), capacitor (two terminal), inductor (one terminal), op amp (3 terminal), power supply (one terminal), ground (one terminal), etc. The use experience should be that in a drawing, they should be able to drag and drop these items and connect them using the wire terminal. The terminals should correspond to \"snap\" point (just like tools like Omnigraffle and others have) to make it easy to connect elements. In addition, a student should be able to add text labels, etc. How do I create such a palette and use it in PoodLL?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: It would be a great thing. But PoodLL does not do that now, and I don't think it could be made to do so easily. There probably is something like that on the net. A quick search turned up this: http://webducate.net/products/dragster/ You might make activities in that (or something like it) and embed them in Moodle.\nComment 2: Thanks for the suggestion. That won't work because we plan to use Moodle for proctored exams (no internet access) and for some of the exams, the ability of students to draw circuits quickly is vital. Is it possible to do what I suggested without the snap points (if that is the complication)?\nComment 3: Its more than just the \"snap\" feature. To drag and drop predefined shapes onto the image would be possible, but would require custom coding. And it would be a like using a knife as a screwdriver. Rather than take the whiteboard in that direction, a separate Drag and Drop widget/plugin would be a better idea I feel. Do you think the OU drag and drop image or text question type would do the job for you: https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=qtype_ddimageortext\nComment 4: Thanks for the suggestion. That is a very interesting tool. I am afraid that that pre-supposes certain points on the canvas that need to be filled up. In a circuit drawing application (or a parts drawing application that a mechanical engineer might be interested in), that does not make any sense. The student is expected to start drawing from a blank slate, and it is interconnectivity of the parts, rather than the precise placement geometrically that matters. What would be the right forum for this? And if one does not exist, what would be the level of coding prowess needed for me to start writing a module (not that I have any time to spare, but still it would be helpful to know)?\nLabel: ",

If and when they pass, they get a grade VALUE that is in the range of 0 to 1000. We are using the latest versions, Moodle 2.6 etc, on a modern server (Rochen) Specifics, User Pathway/experience 1. The User sees a list of courses, renamed as “___ Tests”. Each Course consists of one Quiz; when completed they have completed the Course. 2. User chooses to take Quiz, then ideally they are auto-enrolled(? they are already registered and logged in, so can we do this?) . 3. They see preface screen to the test, showing them test-taking info and links, advisories about the test, etc. 4. They start the fifteen minute timed quiz. The video tapes them automatically and they see the recorder (themselves) on screen. A proctor will review it, to compare it to \"face on file\", and to prevent cheating in several ways (looking at notes, asking someone for answers, etc). 3. Those videos are then deleted, unless there is a controversy. The effort so far: Thanks in advance, and my apologies if we missed something obvious! Greg\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Greg, I replied to your email also. But I will just update here too so that we are all up to speed. It would be nice to know how you use PoodLL in the quiz. Is it a PoodLL Recording Question type? Or is it some other way? And what does \"not working\" or \"not integrating\" look or behave like? Justin\nComment 2: Justin, Can PoodLL be used to record   the whole session when a student takes a test(using webcam)? In addition, if the the course is setup as a single quiz. I would like the student to be recorded automatically when a student is taking a test - so that we know that the authorized student is taking the test and not some friend. Is this standard functionality for PoodLL ? Will the student get an error message if for some reason he/she does not have a webcam? Thanks. Yogesh\nComment 3: Yogesh There is no standard way to do this in PoodLL. It is possible, but probably not without custom coding. I have implemented a solution where each question was video recorded, ie not the whole test in one video, but one video per question. However that is not in the public domain , so I believe that I can't share it with you. Another approach would be to house the quiz in an iframe (via LTI ?) and do the video recording from outside the iframe. Then it would be a simple one video / one quiz scenario. But there would be coding involved. Justin\nComment 4: Thanks, Justin. Appreciate it.\nLabel: ",

I have one concern/request. We are going to be using this primarily with mobile devices (though there are plans to also use the computer lab with it as well). Currently, mobile devices upload video to the system which is completely unnescessary for us. What I'm hoping for is a demux ability in poodll that I haven't seen before. Something that strips the video bitstream out of the file and leaves me with just the audio stored on the server. Is there a setting for this that I am missing, or is it currently not possible?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Nelson. Yes it does that provided you have FFMPEG set up. See here: http://poodll.com/documentation/1.0/11/audio-and-video-conversion/ If you just put the ffmpeg file in the /filter/poodll folder and check the checkbox as on the documentation file, that should be enough. Make sure the ffmpeg can create mp3 and permissions are executable. I have a raft of notes and docs on this, so let me know if you get into trouble\nComment 2: The impression I'm getting from this is it's converting (reencoding) the audio stream, which I would rather the system not do (It's not all that powerful). Or is it demuxing the streams and I'm just misunderstanding? As far as I'm concerned, the final audio format isn't important, so much as just not wasting all that space with the video file attached and not burn resources on a relatively slow processor which has been commandeered for the purpose.\nComment 3: It is set up to convert to mp3, so where the audio stream of the incoming file is not mp3, it will re-encode. With flv, you could just remove video and the remaining audio would play (as flv). I don't know how that would work with mov files though. There is the ability to specify encoding options for ffmpeg, there on the PoodLL filter settings page, but it does assume the end format will be mp3. In my own experience the conversion to mp3 is not a significant drag on the server, but it depends on how many conversions you have going on simultaneously. Related to this, I hope to implement background encoding sometime soon, so that the user doesn't have to wait for conversions to finish.\nLabel: ",

Is this a problem of Flash? The ratio width:height is not 4:3. When I manually adjust the width and the height I get better results. Ralf\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: The capture sizes are all in 4:3 ratio. The video window on the recorder is probably not 4:3, so it might look a little different there to when the recording is viewed in a player. Where do you actually see the problem? Is it on the recorder itself, or in the player after it is recorded?\nComment 2: Hallo Justin, I don't know why I get pictures in Moodle which are not wide enough. In your demo session I found that all pictures should get 10 or 20 percent more in their width. Perhaps this is a problem with flash or with Moodle but i don't know. Ralf\nComment 3: Because we should always look at the simple causes first ... is it possible your browser's zoom setting is over 100%. eg 120% or something like that? With some browser/os combinations it is possible to unwittingly zoom using your mouse wheel or touching the screen. If you see the problem again, maybe you could take a few screenshots or a screencast of it?\nLabel: ",

I have also enabled the filter. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated. Please explain in laymen's terms. I am very new to new Moodle. Thanks and Best!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: The reason you can't see anything in \"add an activity\" is that there is no \"PoodLL Activity.\" Depending on the plugins you installed, i) when you add an assignment, you will be able to select PoodLL (recording, whiteboard etc) for the submission [PoodLL Assignment Submission] ii) when you add questions to a quiz you will be able to choose the poodll question  [PoodLL Recording Question] iii) when you use the html editor , you will be able to add PoodLL stuff (audio recordings, drawings etc) [PoodLL Anywhere for Atto/TinyMCE] Maybe  you could start with the Assignment Submission, or PoodLL Anywhere?\nComment 2: Justin, Thank you.

For those who don't know what this is all about, Poodll has a whole bunch of widgets that can be inserted into Moodle. eg a stopwatch. You do that by inserting a crafty little string that looks like this: {POODLL:type=stopwatch} which turns into stopwatch when you view the activity. The cheat sheet contains information about those crafty filter strings. You can play around, and see them, over at http://demo.poodll.com **NB DON'T COPY AND PASTE THE FILTER STRINGS** The encoding of the text on the PDF and cheatsheet website is wrong. Even without that, invisible html characters often sneak in and break things. Just type the strings out longhand.

I also made some big changes to the whiteboard, which you can see on the demo site. Now if you use Literally Canvas as the PoodLL whiteboard the student can edit their drawings(assignments, quizzes, database entries) at a later time. Previously this wasn't possible. I demonstrate this here: It will also work with drawingboard.js . It doesn't work with the old PoodLL whiteboard though. You can set the default whiteboard in the PoodLL filter settings.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Very impressive! Presumably you could use the line tool to draw straight axes? Also if the teacher added a 2 column data set to the question, could one plot the points and then add an eyeballed linear regression line ?\nComment 2: You could use the line tool to draw axes, yes. Regarding the eyeballed linear regression line, I am just going to wave the white flag, and point out that my major was Political Science. But it would probably need to be drawn freehand if that helps.\nComment 3: Wow!  Justin, this is going to be really useful. Some hiccups... On my mac (OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion), the Safari 6.1.3 web browser doesn't show the background graph, but otherwise it works.  Instead of the background graph, all I see is a small box with \"?\" in it. Firefox 30.0 doesn't show the tools at the bottom, or the background graph. On Ubuntu Linux, firefox 29.0 S does the same thing as Safari did.  (Background graph missing, but tools work.) On a PC running Windows 7, Firefox V28, doesn't show any tools.  Goodle Chrome is the same.  Can't use. So all-in-all, two of the five browsers I tried worked with Poodll whiteboard.   And then, it was missing the background graph paper. Sigh...  I know the feeling of having to deal with the idiosyncrasies of web browsers.  Not fun. Please don't give up!  I want to use it. Peter\nComment 4: Let me have a look at those hiccups shortly. Sorry for the delay, I was hoping to look at them before replying. I had to change the background image logic for both JSs whiteboards. Specifically for literally canvas, I had to change it so that erasing would not erase the background. I am pretty confident we can make it work on the other browsers too.\nLabel: ",

The recording level indicator does not respond. It shows that a file has been created but not getting uploaded. The uploading process goes on and on, never stops. Please reply with a solution or an alternate of this. Waiting for a quick and positive reply.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Sudeep Sorry for the slow reply. What browser are you using? And which recorder are you using? How long are your recordings? There are many things that can go wrong with recording. Most of them are at the browser end of things. Did you try rebooting and using a different browser? Google Chrome has a permissions dialog that is very hard to see. It pops up when you first try to use your webcam/mike on a site. It appears just beneath the address bar in the browser. Almost everyone misses it, even I forget about it. And of course there is the standard flash permissions dialog. If permission is not granted to the camera/mic then the recording will usually fail in the way you describe. Also if Skype or another application is trying to use the webcamera, it can be unavailable for the browser. Sometimes it happens that the other app doesn't release it. Even when the other app is closed down the camera is unavailable. I wonder in these cases if there is a problem with the driver software. I sometimes get this on my mac. Anyway, rebooting and trying a different browser are good steps to take. Finally depending on the recorder you are using, try not selecting \"mp3\" or \"mp4\" on the recorder. Sometimes the conversion process is failing because the server is too busy, or the recording too long, to respond before the browser gives up waiting. Justin\nLabel: ",

Would you recommend to download all of the Poodll plugins? Thanks! Ann\nComment 3: Hi Ann, Yes, I would recommend downloading and using all of the PoodLL plugins. The only one I think about being optional is the PoodLL Online (assignment_poodllonline) as it is for the old Assignment 2.2 type, which I no longer use. Your first link you have listed above downloads directly from Justin's site and if you get the Kaboodle, it will include all you need to get going.The second link is also ok, just have to download the different parts, one at a time. The main add-on of the bunch that all the other parts depend on is the filter. Their installation depends on the filter being installed, too. If your site folder permissions are set right and your site is registered with Moodle, an admin can actually do all the installs right in Moodle 2.5.x, by going to Administration > Site Administration > Plugins > Install add-ons then click on Install add-ons from the Moodle plugins directory. AL\nComment 4: Hi Ann, Just like Al said really. If you have a clear idea of where you want to use it, then you could just download the modules you need. Most people probably don't use the 2.2 assignment type anymore or the database activity field(though you can do fun stuff with it) . So if you install piecemeal from Moodle.org, you might leave those off. The one mod you must have is the PoodLL filter. Everything else uses stuff from there. Stuff generally goes up on poodll.com earlier than on Moodle.org. But at the moment everything is up to date everywhere. Just to confuse things, there is a new mod, PoodLL Anywhere. It adds recording icons to the TinyMCE editor. If you use that you probably don't need the PoodLL repository anymore either. PoodLL Anywhere can be downloaded from the page you referenced, but it is not in the Kaboodle bundle or available from Moodle.org yet. Hmm, lets summarize this a bit PoodLL Add-on On PoodLL.com In Kaboodle On Moodle.org Notes PoodLL Filter Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Question Type Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Repository Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Assignment Submission Yes Yes Yes for new Moodle assignment (avail. from Moodle 2.3) PoodLL Assignment Feedback Yes Yes Yes for new Moodle assignment (avail. from Moodle 2.3) PoodLL Assignment Type Yes Yes Yes for old Moodle assignment PoodLL Anywhere Yes No No adds PoodLL icons to TinyMCE HTML area PoodLL Database Activity Field Yes Yes Yes\nComment 5: Thanks Justin!

Keen to have students record their own voices so downloaded Poodll Kabodle. Noticed the version was only up to 2,5 but went ahead anyway because I am that sort of guy. Uploaded the zip to my site, extracted, copied directories. Noticed there as no overwrite messages as suggested in the Poodll docs  but Moodle upgraded my database and declared the whole thing a success, Added an assignment and sure enough there is a Poodl voice recorder and whiteboard option and I ticked the mp3 submission. The assignment does not show the recorder widget though- what have I missed? The assignment does not have any sort of recording feature available. I checked the docs and it mentioned configuring Modules->Filters->Manage Filters under site admin. I can't locate this. Is it my version or just me lost in the menus?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Sounds like very out of date docs... Site administration > Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters ...however, I have never seen Poodl (sp?) so that may be nothing to do with your issue.\nComment 2: Hi James, Yes, the PoodLL Filter has to be enabled for any of the other parts of PoodLL to work. It is located at Site Administration >  Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters. The PoodLL Filter Active should be set to On. The Apply to should be set to either Content or Content and Headings. You should also have it higher in the list than the Multimedia plugins filter, or you may see two players in some locations instead of just the PoodLL player. HTH , AL\nComment 3: Hi James Just like Al and Howard said, the filter settings are at: Site Administration >  Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters And PoodLL in particular (once enabled) at Site Administration >  Plugins > Filters > PoodLL Filter It should actually work without the PoodLL filter being enabled , though that is not the usual setup. There are two main possibilities for this situation that are really just about learning how to use the Moodel assignment. ( I am assuming this is the new Moodle assignment (new as of Moodle 2.3). If you didn't know that there was an older version of the Moodle assignment, then you are probably ok. Since it should default to the new one.) i) did you configure PoodLL recording for the assignment submission? Or the assignment feedback? The assignment submission is what the student will do. The assignment feedback is how you respond to them. ii) Are you testing this by logging in as a student? By default a non student can't actually even do the assignment. So you have to be a student, then you will see a button saying \"add submission\" and it all starts from there. Justin\nComment 4: Woohoo! I have created a student recording. Thanks everyone for their time and your suggestions ( filters, add a submission) were just what I needed.  Starting to feel like I can achieve something.\nComment 5: Step forward, step back. I can see Poodll depends on the student's device to do the recording and the recording widget in the assignment shows up fine on my brand new laptop. However trying to record using  a 2.2 Android Tablet told me Android 4 was necessary. I think many of my students usually access the net through Android phones rather than from computers and the recording looks well suited to accessing using Android. The recording app looks great but where to from here? I might try a poll of students to see how many use the same sort of outdated technology as me.\nComment 6: Yes, prior to Android 4 and iOS 6, file upload was not possible using the Mobile Safari and the android default browser. PoodLL handles recordings from mobile devices using the file upload dialog, because it is possible to record at least video, and in most Android cases audio also, directly from there. Anyway I put the version check there, because it was not clear to students on older OS why it was not working. Sorry about the limit, but it is out of our hands really.\nComment 7: I understand - there must be hundreds of variations of hardware/browser and version numbers for users and an impossibility to support every variation. It does seem though to limit the usefulness of the audio recording to a situation where the user all use the same setup, as in a language lab, as opposed to using their own devices.\nComment 8: Had a look today at setup for students in language labs, shared computers and think I spoke too soon - students should be able to access a machine which can submit a recording through Poodll. A standard recording, a common format and time limits are too good to ignore.\nComment 9: Wonderful that sounds good. It is also nice to have them all in one room when you first do it, so that you can walk them through it. eg When the flash permissions dialog popups ... You can tell them what to do. If they record audio regularly the nervousness and pressure fade away, but the first few times it helps to take it slowly. So I might ask them to practice their speech/introduction a few times with different partners before they record. Also if you make the thing that they record basically a no brainer, eg say some tongue twisters, sing a nursery rhyme, or read a dialog from the book. That lowers the bar too. You will possibly run into technical quicksands the first time you do it. eg The browsers are too old, or half the microphones are broken . So it pays to do the activity yourself on the student machines first, so you know what will happen for them. Not doing this still catches me out sometimes. And making the first activity obviously not important ( some tongue twisters etc) means you won't get students too frustrated if things don't go right.\nComment 10: Hi, similar follow-up question.  Brand new Moodle 2.6+ install, just installed Poodll for the first time over the weekend. Awsome plugin. Created an assignment, everything seems fine.  From the Student perspective, it works perfectly.  I'm able to record a video and submit it from grading. From the Teacher perspective, I can view the submission and I see the \"feedback poodll\"  However, it doesn't bring up the flash button to access the webcam.  Therefore, nothing is recorded.  It \"pretends\" to record, and submits, but no video. I'll upload screenshots and config settings, but is this a known issue to anyone? Thanks!\nComment 11: HI Mike So  the students assignment submission for video works, but the teachers feedback doesn't. And that you think it might be the flash permissions for the webcam/microphone. I have not heard of that specific problem, but there are a few things you might check. Does it work from a different browser? And if you are using Chrome, did you see the little popup permissions dialog that Chrome requires for webcam access?  If you didn't see it, and it is very easy to miss, that might be the problem. It shows just below the address bar of your browser. Also is the little connection lamp on the lower left of the recorder green? If not you won't be able to record until a connection to the recording server is made. Do other PoodLL feedback types work, eg mp3 recording or whiteboard? I made a lot of changes \"under the hood\" recently. So it is possible I missed something in the PoodLL Feedback mod, so please let me know how you get on.\nComment 12: Hi Justin, Just checked and there were a couple of PoodLL updates released today. PoodLL Recording and Online PoodLL Submission. After upgrade the only type of PoodLL feedback available for submissions is MP3. No others show in the drop down. By the way, the new delete button for feedback is a nice new feature. AL\nComment 13: Hi Justin, That's correct, student looks fine, teachers record audio on feedback, but no video.  Tried different browsers, no difference.  I signed in as the student on Chrome, then signed out. Then teacher on the same session. Audio appears to be fine but no video. If you'd like to test: Moodle = http://www.hv-elearning.org/ Student = spoodll/spoodll Teacher = tpoodll/tpoodll I have a POODLL testing course to help us figure this out.\nComment 14: Mike I was able to login and leave a  video as feedback. Even though  I was behind a firewall and on a poor connection, which affects the recording quality. But I am in Japan and so a lot closer to the Red5 server than you. Sooo, it might just be a problem with your connection to the red5 server. That would not explain why you can record as a student but not as a teacher though. If you try lowering the capture size of the video from 480x360 to something lower. Does that make a difference? If so that would indicate your connection couldn't handle as much video as mine. Also I notice a bit of flickering when the players load. You might want to check that the multimedia plugins filter is not also trying to display flv videos. If so uncheck flv on the PoodLL filter settings page, or on the multi media plugins equivalent at site administration - > appearance -> media embedding. Justin\nComment 15: Hi Justin, I saw the feedback in the system, not sure why yours is working and mine isn't.  I'll do some further testing.  I'm in Cincinnati, the server is an Amazon EC2 virtual in Virginia. I disabled .flv in the embedded media player, no difference that I see.  In both Chrome and IE11, the \"physical webcam light\" doesn't turn on, but the record, play and stop/submit buttons work as expected.   It just records a blank screen, then when I hit stop/submit, it says submitted. Here is a message from the php_error.log that looks related.  I'm not using any of the portfolio functionality (just installed it for test).  I'll remove it ========================== [21-Jan-2014 14:10:04 UTC] PHP Notice: The third parameter sent to the function set_callback_options should be the component name, not a file path, please update this.<ul style=\"text-align: left\" dat a-rel=\"backtrace\"><li>line 1319 of /lib/portfoliolib.php: call to debugging()</li><li>line 153 of /lib/portfoliolib.php: call to portfolio_include_callback_file()</li><li>line 665 of /mod/assign/submi ssion/onlinepoodll/locallib.php: call to portfolio_add_button->set_callback_options()</li><li>line 578 of /mod/assign/submission/onlinepoodll/locallib.php: call to assign_submission_onlinepoodll->get_ p_links()</li><li>line 893 of /mod/assign/renderer.php: call to assign_submission_onlinepoodll->view_summary()</li><li>line 221 of /lib/outputrenderers.php: call to mod_assign_renderer->render_assign_ submission_plugin_submission()</li><li>line 664 of /mod/assign/renderer.php: call to plugin_renderer_base->render()</li><li>line 221 of /lib/outputrenderers.php: call to mod_assign_renderer->render_as sign_submission_status()</li><li>line 2803 of /mod/assign/locall in /var/www/html/moodle/lib/weblib.php on line 2947 [root@ip-172-31-32-100 tmp]# ============================ Also, trying to display the \"blank\" feedback gives this online: Unknown exception related to local files (Can not fetch file form URL ) More information about this error Debug info: Error code: storedfileproblem Stack trace: line 1123 of /lib/filestorage/file_storage.php: file_exception thrown line 1092 of /filter/poodll/poodllfilelib.php: call to file_storage->create_file_from_url() line 3851 of /filter/poodll/poodllresourcelib.php: call to instance_remotedownload() line 3574 of /filter/poodll/poodllresourcelib.php: call to fetchVideoSplash() line 2770 of /filter/poodll/poodllresourcelib.php: call to fetchFlowPlayerCode() line 591 of /filter/poodll/filter.php: call to fetchSimpleVideoPlayer() line ? of unknownfile: call to filter_poodll_mp4flv_callback() line 83 of /filter/poodll/filter.php: call to preg_replace_callback() line 167 of /lib/filterlib.php: call to filter_poodll->filter() line 205 of /lib/filterlib.php: call to filter_manager->apply_filter_chain() line 337 of /lib/filterlib.php: call to filter_manager->filter_text() line 1205 of /lib/weblib.php: call to performance_measuring_filter_manager->filter_text() line 493 of /mod/assign/feedback/poodll/locallib.php: call to format_text() line 411 of /mod/assign/feedback/poodll/locallib.php: call to assign_feedback_poodll->fetch_responses() line 1094 of /mod/assign/gradingtable.php: call to assign_feedback_poodll->view_summary() line 1203 of /mod/assign/gradingtable.php: call to assign_grading_table->format_plugin_summary_with_link() line 729 of /lib/tablelib.php: call to assign_grading_table->other_cols() line 433 of /mod/assign/gradingtable.php: call to flexible_table->format_row() line 1330 of /lib/tablelib.php: call to assign_grading_table->format_row() line 1442 of /lib/tablelib.php: call to table_ sql ->build_table() line 1185 of /mod/assign/renderer.php: call to table_sql->out() line 981 of /mod/assign/renderer.php: call to mod_assign_renderer->flexible_table() line 221 of /lib/outputrenderers.php: call to mod_assign_renderer->render_assign_grading_table() line 3082 of /mod/assign/locallib.php: call to plugin_renderer_base->render() line 3114 of /mod/assign/locallib.php: call to assign->view_grading_table() line 505 of /mod/assign/locallib.php: call to assign->view_grading_page() line 53 of /mod/assign/view.php: call to assign->view()\nComment 16: Mike, The first error relates to the portfolio export function, and looks like something I should fix. But I think it is not the problem you are having. The second error is occurring because there is no file to display. I think that is caused because your camera is not being picked up and the recorder is recording, but recording nothing. That still doesn't explain why only \"feedback\" is giving the problem. Before you commence recording, try checking both the device settings on the recorders settings tab, and the webcam settings on the flash properties page (right click the recorder). Can you select the webcam on either of those locations and cause the webcam light to light up? Justin\nComment 17: Hi Justin, I'm going to give you the best and worst news of all of IT.  It's working perfectly, I can't break it, I can't reproduce the problem, and I'm not sure what changed. Sorry about that. I have auto-update turned on in Moodle, I powered off&on my Laptop.  Not sure what else changed. But in any event, it's working just fine now. I can say it woks in the current version of Moodle, PooDLL, Windows 8,1 Chrome, and IE 11. So whatever the problem was, the answer is to update. ====================================== Again, thanks!  At some point, I'll configure FFMPEG and test further.  I'd like to take some of the workload off of your server. Thanks again for all you do!\nComment 18: The 'ol reboot did the trick perhaps. Or caching was somehow getting you. Anyway thats good news.\nLabel: ",

If not, please let me know. I would like to give faculty the ability to give and receive audio for feedback and assignment from within Moodle. We are running 2.5.2 (and plan to upgrade to 2.5.2 in a few weeks). Has anyone used any of these: https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=13 I am particularly interested in these for recording audio: https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=repository_poodll https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=assignsubmission_onlinepoodll https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=qtype_poodllrecording Does anyone have any experience with these? Is there another you would recommend over these? Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I have them on my system in work, and although they are not in widespread use yet (we upgraded to 2.5 ready for this term which started this week and Poodll was added as part of that upgrade) they work very well in all the testing I have done with them and look very easy to use. Richard\nComment 2: All PoodLL plugins are working very well in my Moodle2.4 and 2.5. The PoodLL should be included into the core. It will bring up Moodle to a super multimedia LMS. Go PoodLL!\nLabel: "
