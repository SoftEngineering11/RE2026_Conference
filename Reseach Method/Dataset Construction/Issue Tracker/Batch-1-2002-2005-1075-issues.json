Maybe the wizards could grow out of Ray's lesson module.  \n\n\n\nI'd be interested in adding tips/research regarding: handling differentiated learning; neurodevelopmental themes, etc..  As well as ways to reference National Strands while building activities, or having access to best practices which tend to have constructionist underpinnings.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Sunday,  29 February 2004, 09:31 AM:\n\nThis bug's title seems to be blank, please solve it.\n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\nFrom Frances Bell (f.bell at salford.ac.uk) Monday,  20 February 2006, 01:16 AM:\n\nI think it would be good to have these tips to be customisable, e.g. another button at discussion posting that brought up the 'rules/guidelines of the forum'.  Good practice from Kim and Precce suggests that these should be developed (Create, enforce, evolve) within the community that uses them.\n\nFrom Christian Lebe (christian at moodle.com) Wednesday,  12 April 2006, 12:14 PM:\n\nFound most of the tips throghout Modules and activity. I assumed this bug should be closed (fixed). Feel free to re-open.\n\nFrom wild girl (helen.foster at altoncollege.ac.uk) Thursday,  13 April 2006, 02:12 AM:\n\nAlso, links to Moodle Docs provide opportunties for pedagogical tips :-)",

One of the ways they get credit for the class is to post to the forum. They are expected to make original posts and to respond to posts made by classmates.\n\n\n\nI  need to see both original posts and reply posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe students in CORAL post to each other on the webboard. Most of the posts have a subject heading that includes who they are directing the post *to* and tom calls this Who to Whom and counting posts made to others is an important research thing of his. For example, how many posts did Lue direct to pfaye, kind of thing. It would be ideal for who to whom tracking, to add to the forum post data entry screen a drop down menu that includes names of all people in the class (including professors) so the writer just clicks (and contrl-click to select out of sequence and shift click for a range, and an option to the whole group. There could be a new line on the forum post display to show the who to whom to keep the subject from being too long (on our webboard now they preface their subject line with paula to tom kind of thing)\n\n\n\nHere's an idea I had for getting the report.\n\n\n\nthere are two tables that I can use:\n\n\n\nmdl_user  (has basic user info, one record per person)\n\nmdl_forum_posts  (the posts)\n\n now has a new field, wtw (who to whom)\n\n\n\nI don't know how to write the code but here's what I want to do:\n\n\n\n\n\nopen mdl_user and index on lastname+firstname (actual field names)\n\n\n\nprint lastname, firstname\n\n\n\nsomehow mdl_user is joined to mdl_forum_posts on the userid field (which comes from the ID field in the mdl_user table) AND forum_posts is indexed userid+wtw+subject\n\n\n\nwhile the ID matches mdl_user\n\n    print 5 blank spaces + wtw+ subject (flag a differentiation between original posts and replies) and date of post. When there is repetition of the wtw don't repeat it, just indent under the first occurrence.\n\n    skip to next record in mdl_forum_posts and \n\n      new line repeats with 5 blank spaces+subject\n\n\n\n Once the records have all been printed\n\n Some kind of summary: x number of orig posts, x number of replies, x number of orig posts that attracted replies from others, x number of posts to each name on the list of wtw\n\n \n\n print some kind of break, a straight line, to separate users\n\n \n\n go back to mdl_user and skip to the next user record\n\n repeat the join with mdl_forum_posts\n\n \n\n and so on.\n\n \n\n final summary is like this:\n\n \n\n see attached picture\n\n This picture is from a powerpoint presentation one of my profs made analyzing collaboration and communication of an online research project. If you want to see the whole presentation go to http://matrixmagic.com/cweb and it's in a class called CORAL May Conference. It's the forum entry titled 025results.ppt (attached) made by me, paula.  This conference allows guests with the registration key coral-reef (no quotes)\n\n\n\nOops ...  the picture was too big to upload so I uploaded to this conference and posted it as a reply to the the original post that has attached the entire ppt presentation.",

I made changes across the system to standardise the use of userdate() when displaying dates.  Since all the dates are stored in unixtime format (ie GMT), this function can use the user preference (timezone) to calculate the time in that user's timezone.\n\n\n\nA value of 99 for timezone (the default value) means the display will be as it was before (server time).\n\n\n\nLooking good so far.",

I want to learn Flash, but there just isn't time.  \n\n\n\nStarting points:  http://www.opaque.net/ming/\n\nhttp://www.develooping.com/html/chatenglish.php?flash=1\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  22 August 2002, 04:58 PM:\n\nI'm looking at using phpOpenChat now and heavily modifying it (ie removing the 90% of it I don't need).\n\n\n\n http://www.ortelius.de/phpopenchat/\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  16 October 2002, 08:56 PM:\n\nSome of the features I want to see in the chat module are:\n\n\n\n- Simple, fast, interface\n\n- Arbitrary amount of private rooms\n\n- Complete logging\n\n- User pictures are shown next to each comment\n\n- Requires nothing above existing Moodle requirements (ie PHP 4 and database).\n\n\n\nFrom Greg Barnett (gregb at crowncollege.edu) Wednesday,  18 December 2002, 02:26 PM:\n\nIn addition to text chat, audio and video conferencing would be wonderful.\n\n\n\nCurrently we are using HearMe for audio conferencing at Crown College, but moving to something more reliable/open source would be a huge improvement.\n\n\n\nI've taken a cursory look at JMF (Java Media Framework) and it looks like it has all of the bits needed to put together an audio/video conferencing applet and server for the applet to talk to.  I hope that sometime in late January I or another developer at Crown College will be able to put together a prototype to test out JMF.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday, 7 January 2003, 08:36 PM:\n\nCurrent favourite starting point:  ARSC\n\n\n\n  http://manuel.kiessling.net/projects/software/arsc/\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Tuesday, 1 April 2003, 05:19 PM:\n\nAny consideration for a Java applet based chat module? I have some experience here and would be prepared to have a go at it. There are some existing but they are basic single channel jobs. Would need to start by defining or finding a suitable protcol. I firewall bashing web services setup on port 80 would be the way to go I think. \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  17 April 2003, 12:11 AM:\n\nNo, I have no interest in Java.  :-)\n\n\n\nMoodle used to actually have a Java based chat (see http://dougiamas.com/chat) with a C-based backend, but there were too many problems just with clients, let alone people trying to run compiled C daemons on webhosts.\n\n\n\nNo, it has to be pure PHP and operate via normal HTTP.\n\n\n\nScott Harrison says he's close to starting work on porting ARSC.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  17 April 2003, 12:13 AM:\n\nJust for reference to some of the other discussion about this:  <A HREF=http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=413>http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=413</A>\n\nFrom paula edmiston (edmiston at matrixmagic.com) Saturday,  19 April 2003, 07:16 PM:\n\nThree important features of a chat are 1) the ability to record a log of the conversation for future reference and study and 2) the presence of multiple rooms so that different groups can converse with disturbing each other and 3)easy to use on multiple platforms of various ages, abilities and slow-mo dialup modems. I studied the cited thread on chat and used the chat Jabber that was mentioned in the thread. I thought it was pretty good. It had the ability to record conversation and have multiple rooms. \n\n\n\nI thought the way it handled multiple rooms was confusing to a newcomer. But the recorded log is on the person's own PC and it'd be better to log the conversation on the server (save the bother of uploading and avoid the problem of forgetting to upload or accidently destroying it). Another negative aspect was the necessity of going out and finding and downloading and installing a client program. For newcomers to the net this can be a problem and for experienced people it's a time-suck annoyance.\n\n\n\nMuch better is to have some kind of built-in interface to accessing the talker. I run a talker at http://edmiston.org/talker  for the java interface or telnet to edmiston.org port 8001) that i use for my students. I am there Tuesday evenings for office hours 7-9PM ET (USA) if anyone wants to come and try it out. I use a java interface which is problematic because so many of my students are on older Macintosh computers that don't support java and even modern computers seem to have problems with java. http://euts.org has a marvelous html, text-based interface to their talker that seems very flexible to me and very accessible to older equipment.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  19 April 2003, 07:21 PM:\n\nYes, the port of ARSC as I imagine it will satisfy all these ideas.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  11 July 2003, 03:43 PM:\n\nWell, this chat module is well under way now and works well in a basic kind of way.  The current code base is going to be a great platform to go forward with some very cool features.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  27 August 2003, 03:30 PM:\n\nI'm closing this.  Small bugs can be opened for specific features.",

Until now I've been working with fairly small classes (under 10 people) but groups of some kind are going to be essential with large classes, especially with the amount of dialogue that Moodle promotes.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  21 June 2002, 12:08 AM:\n\nI've done some work over in MDL-32 (fixing up the forums) that will now allow this sort of thing ... each forum type will be a different type of group work.  Stay tuned.\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Tuesday,  20 August 2002, 11:18 AM:\n\nIt maybe obvious but I'd find it useful to issue assignments *to* a group.\n\nFrom P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Sunday, 1 June 2003, 04:57 PM:\n\nThe most obvious (to me) way in which groups can work is that a module is issued to one or a few groups, rather than to the whole class. Only members of these groups have access. However, in collaborative modules such as forums or workshops, there is one more variable: when a forum is issued to some or all groups, the members of those groups can share the module among all of them, or each group can have its 'own copy' of the module. How are you planning to implement groupwork? Can you fill us in a little?\n\nFrom Richard Watkins (rww at hinchbk.cambs.sch.uk) Thursday,  12 June 2003, 04:29 PM:\n\nCan we also ensure that groups can be assigned to inividual (or groups of) teachers so those teachers only see information relevant to the pupils they teach. (or is that something that was going to be done anyway?)\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  13 June 2003, 10:21 PM:\n\nI've started a discussion here: <a href=http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1545>http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1545</a>\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Thursday,  11 March 2004, 07:19 AM:\n\nI close this bug because groups are coming and some new bugs about the groups have arrived.\n\n\n\nReopen is necessary.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Thursday,  11 March 2004, 07:20 AM:\n\nReopen IF necessary\n\n(second mistake with the S/F, sorry) :-(",

This would mean that students who change courses after update will still be subscribed/unsubscribed appropriately.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  26 July 2002, 12:16 AM:\n\nNot sure what you mean by this ... can you explain it further?\n\nFrom   (matth at unsw.edu.au) Sunday,  28 July 2002, 10:25 PM:\n\nOkay. When I first implimented this, I had a form which would then cycle though the list of users, adding each one to the subscription list. This worked, but did not account for users enrolled after the script is run.\n\n\n\nMy suggested implimentatation would be to expand the `forum' table with a flag, all_subscribed ENUM(YES,NO).\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  28 July 2002, 10:38 PM:\n\nAh, I see what you mean.  That's actually what I meant when I said the forums should have an option (ie a flag).  I was suggesting having a check in the login process which checks for any forums with this flag set - and if any exist then it would subscribe them then (eg the first time they log in)\n\n\n\nBut really there's no need to even subscribe them - the is_subscribed() function can just check for that flag and return yes for any enrolled student.  Which is probably what you mean.  Much better!\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday, 1 August 2002, 02:28 PM:\n\nThis has been fixed.  Forums now have buttons at the top for toggling a flag forcesubscribe.  \n\n\n\nWHen on, then everyone will receive mail whether they have previously chosen to subscribe or not (these settings are kept though).  People can not change their settings when the forum is in this mode.\n\n\n\nWhen off, everyone can choose their own setting per-forum, and the teacher gets a link to see who is subscribed at the moment.\n\n\n\nThe news forum defaults to forcesubscribe turned on, while for others this is turned off by default.",

I don't think there's an interface to set this yet, I was setting them manually to get the teacher lists to look right on the user listing and on the course listing.

Each column is automatically generated by a standard function in that module (similar to the way activity reports work now).\n\n\n\nThe grade system can also add calculated columns (created by some customisable math function from the other columns) and manual columns, which are manually edited (grades from a laboratory practical, for example).\n\n\n\nThe grade system can also export all grades to XML, Excel, SOAP? and so on.  Later, possibly, it could push grades straight out to an external database.\n\n\n\nThe grade system can also import manual columns from external files, and match them based on some user-selectable criteria (eg student ID).\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  23 October 2002, 11:25 PM:\n\nBasic layout is done, and export to CSV and Excel.\n\n\n\nCalculated columns, manual columns and imports still to go\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  28 October 2002, 10:02 AM:\n\nAnd don't forget a student view with all-grades-on-a-page.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  10 November 2002, 07:23 PM:\n\nManual columns are now possible using offline assignments\n\nFrom P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Saturday,  21 December 2002, 04:41 AM:\n\nI think it would also be useful if the teachers could divide the grade columns into pages. In courses where there are a lot of grades the gradebook table could grow enormously. The teacher should be able to create a few pages and group grade columns on them (e.g. by learning unit)\n\nFrom Peter Thourson (peter at thourson.com) Wednesday,  12 February 2003, 07:11 AM:\n\nAlso, allow excused assignements. With this setting, students with no score will not get their grade dropped. So for example, one student would have their grade 9 out of 10 possible points and other could have their grade 7 out of 8 possible points.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  11 July 2003, 03:46 PM:\n\nThis also includes the ability to define custom grade scales and apply them in any module - this feature will definitely be in 1.1 now.\n\nFrom Yu Zhang (yu at moodle.com) Thursday,  13 April 2006, 11:27 AM:\n\nGradebook?",

Is it ready to start testing?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  12 October 2002, 12:03 AM:\n\nToo many other things have jumped on me this week ... it's  progressing slowly.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  15 October 2002, 08:58 PM:\n\nOK, it seems reliable enough now for alpha testing - if you're keen to have a look, feel free to check it out of CVS.\n\n\n\nBetween alpha versions of this quiz module I recommend  the following process:\n\nDelete all quizzes in your course, then \n\ndrop all the quiz tables and delete the quiz line from\n\nthe modules table.\n\n\n\nThings to do still before I'll consider releasing it as part of 1.0.6:\n\n\n\n  - add/edit/remove categories\n\n  - display question feedback on submissions ...\n\n  - record the time they started the quiz, as well as the completion.\n\n  - place time limits between attempts\n\n  - add full specification of quiz open time and quiz close time\n\nFrom Jacob Romeyn (jacob at romeyn.org) Thursday,  17 October 2002, 12:49 AM:\n\nI just installed the upgrade via cvs and now when I write a Quiz and try to do the Quiz as a student it says:\n\n\n\nThis quiz closed on Wednesday, 31 December 1969, 05:00 PM\n\n\n\nMy server is set to the correct date where does it get this date?\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  17 October 2002, 08:52 AM:\n\nIt gets them from the page where you set up the quiz!  :-)\n\n\n\nThere's an open date and a close date.\n\n\n\nIf you had older versions of the quiz module I recommend you drop all the tables - they are still changing and I'm not spending time making nice upgrades between them yet.\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Tuesday,  22 October 2002, 09:50 AM:\n\nMartin,\n\n\n\nHow to go about implementing a show student's quiz answers function.  I don't see where you are saving anything but the total points on a quiz?\n\n\n\nI would like to have missed questions saved with the user and quiz id in a table somewhere.  I see the following uses:\n\n\n\n1. track most missed questions.  If people are missing it consistently, I'm screwing something up teaching it...  Proably could use hte logging features to make nifty graphs...\n\n\n\n2. identify each students weak areas.  I'd like to look at how a given student did on the quiz.\n\n\n\nAs it stands I can't tell where people are weak or where they might have stopped their reading.. ;)\n\n\n\nWhere could this be added?  Is this something to consider before 1.0.6?  Is there intelligent life in the universe?\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Tuesday,  22 October 2002, 09:53 AM:\n\nSorry.  My dumb, this data is in quiz_try, right?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  22 October 2002, 10:57 AM:\n\nDon't worry - everything is stored and reconstructable, and I'm actually working on this necessary feature right now (it's the last one on my list before 1.0.6 beta).\n\n\n\nAnother reason for storing everything is to regrade all the completed quizzes in case a question changes.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  22 October 2002, 10:57 AM:\n\nThe responses are actually all stored in quiz_responses\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  22 October 2002, 12:38 PM:\n\nYou can now see the student attempts (from the report page)\n\n\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, all basic features for the quiz module are now done, so I'm closing this bug so I can experience the huge amount of satisfaction that I know that action will provide me. ;-)\n\n\n\nI'm very happy with the results so far - I think this is a better quiz system already than most others that are around.  (pats self on back)  ;-)\n\n\n\nAny more issues - please open new, specific bug reports.\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Tuesday,  22 October 2002, 08:49 PM:\n\nGreat work Martin!!\n\n\n\nI agree, it's quite functional.  I want to file one more feature request that expands the reporting function.\n\n\n\nStudents also need to view their old answers and the model for exam study.  Maybe take the teacher reporting and just remodle it to allow student access to student's own results?\n\n\n\nAgain fantastic work.. pat pat.. :)",

Perhaps either the student or third party has an interest in shielding the student's email contact from the instructor.  Perhaps implement as a field that only the admin had read access to and not instructor.  \n\n\n\nIn any event, I think implementing a contact component would be the long-term fix.\n\n\n\nConsider this case.  All contact in forums could shield email addresses but should a student be accepting private messages then the Contact component to provide for an individual mail message MTA to individual students.\n\n\n\nWith this approach more granularity is possible.  You could allow someone to display all email addresses, hide from certain Teams/individuals/etc., show no emails, provide for individual contact via contact compenent or refuse based on email address hide criteria.\n\n\n\nI guess when the task group features for assignments gets implemented you would have the real chance of people wanted to hide/show emails or allow personal hidden contact from individual students, task groups, guests, etc.\n\nFrom   (apmuthu at usa.net) Wednesday,  21 August 2002, 10:57 AM:\n\nCan be implemented as a text to graphic element or listed as an unicode element besides the usual uniformly worded link.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  21 August 2002, 11:47 AM:\n\nCan you give more details on what you mean by the Unicode idea?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  21 August 2002, 09:46 PM:\n\nI've added code this evening to CVS (and moodle.com) which implements a first pass at this.  Basically you can now choose between:\n\n\n\n0) Allow nobody to see the real email address (except the teacher of each course and the admin)\n\n1) Allow everyone to see the real email address, all the time. (previous behaviour)\n\n2) Allow only participants in the same course to see the email address (new default behaviour)\n\n\n\nThis has the effect of immediately hiding all the emails  in site forums (ie from robot spam trawlers) unless the person chooses otherwise (I use TMDA - I have no fear!)\n\n\n\nIn the Moodle demo courses the email defaults to being shown, but the user can now choose to hide it.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  11 July 2003, 04:39 PM:\n\nAll email addresses are now obfuscated to prevent spam crawlers.  I'm closing this bug.\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Sunday,  13 July 2003, 03:43 AM:\n\nit's sad that the usenet and email world has come to this.. :<",

    "Description": "User management needs to be expanded and consolidated into one new system.  This system is to allow maximum connectivity with existing databases of users, aiming to completely minimise any work for teachers and students.  Moodle should be able to hook up and just keep working.  Some specific features:\n\n\n\n- allow arbitrary extra user fields in user database\n\n\n\n- internal database of users can be linked to an external database via some kind of flexible gateway (with plugins for different methods eg SOAP, CGI, direct table etc).  The admin can choose fields on the internal database that map to fields on the external source (eg username, firstname, lastname, password, id number).  These can be cached locally or supported through direct lookup.  Moodle will prevent users modifying these fields internally and instead forward them to some external web page (defined by admin)\n\n\n\n- users can be selected individually or by some selection criteria (eg an institution enrolment field)  and assigned to particular courses.  This assignation can be once-off or periodically checked.  Admin has full control of this, and teachers have a limited subset of control.\n\n\n\n- current method of self-enrolment should still be supported as an option",

Can also choose what fields map to local fields (username and password are a minimum, but you might also want email, ID number etc)\n\n\n\n* When user types in their username and password\n\n to log in), Moodle first checks it against the external source.\n\n\n\n* If the username/password were correct, Moodle creates or updates a local entry in the user table, copying all the fields that were mapped on the source.\n\n\n\n * If the username didn't exist on the source then any local copy is also wiped and access is denied.\n\n\n\n* Lastly, if the user attempts to change their username or password then Moodle forwards them to an admin-defined external URL to do it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  13 September 2002, 04:38 PM:\n\nDon't forget LDAP!\n\n\n\nif (!$connect = ldap_connect(<server>, <port>)) {\n\n//error\n\nexit;\n\n}\n\nif (!$res = @ldap_bind($ldap, $user, $password)) {\n\n//error\n\nexit;\n\n} \n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Thursday,  19 September 2002, 07:47 PM:\n\nI have no experince with SOAP, but I could help with LDAP-plugin.

    "Description": "A calendar module that integrates the display of events from all courses might be a useful thing.\n\n\n\nI'm not really sure yet that this has a place in Moodle (there are so many calendars around already, plus time-sensitive courses would use the weekly format).  \n\n\n\nHowever, this bug is a place to discuss what a Moodle calendar might look like and how it should work.",

      "01/May/04 4:51 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From   (ed at pacificstream.com) Sunday,  26 January 2003, 07:35 AM:\n\nIt would be useful to be able to plug in a Calendar module like that used in phpWebsite.\n\nWe previously did a project on the ideas of a web based teaching environment and one of the concepts there was to include the normal event schedules and notices that are presented in a 'real world' teaching environment. So a calendar that was read only (for students) would do this.\n\n\n\nAdditionally we are about to use Moodle as a 'support site', as you already do Martin. And having a  collaborative calendar facility (read and write for Facilitators) is something I'm looking at solutions for.\n\n\n\nIn both these it would be good to have options to view in various layouts (day, week, month). But primarily I think it is most useful to view as a List, with options for ordering (strict chronology, reverse chronology, by author, most recent additions).\n\nFrom marcel berteler (marcel at pluk.nl) Thursday,  15 May 2003, 04:58 PM:\n\nI think it is verry usefull. Lets start with a calendar in monthly mode that allows you to go to the next and previous months.\n\n\n\nAfter this I think the due dates should go in there. \n\n\n\nIt would be great if all the due dates of all the 'classes' the uses is registered for show in the calendar, so the user gets a calender that is personal.\n\n\n\nThe users don't have to be able to write in it, but it would be a great idea if teachers can read/write.\n\n\n\nFor the option that includes due dates, I think the list option is a good idea. That way it doesn't get stuffed.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  14 January 2004, 09:42 PM:\n\nI have provided the code to implement the events table in the discussion at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=4466&parent=20385\n\n\n\nWhen it is in CVS I will provide a webcalendar plugin. What would be the best place to put these plugins? How about http://moodle.cvs.sourceforge.net/moodle/contrib/calendar/?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Friday,  30 April 2004, 08:51 PM:\n\nI am closing this bug because a calendar system now exists (and it is much more satisfactory than my webcalendar plug-in that was mentioned in my previous comment).",

      "27/Aug/03 4:51 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Greg Barnett (gregb at crowncollege.edu) Wednesday,  18 December 2002, 05:32 AM:\n\nIn addition to being able to reset/copy/archive courses, it would be great if we could have a master version of a course, and as many simultaneous instances of the course as possible.\n\n\n\nAs an example: we run a 3 week rotation for most of our classes.  One class that is taught every other 3 week session is HUM125 (English Composition I).  Our students taking HUM125 are split up into 3 groups. We have one group that meets in the morning (all students attend online).  We have 2 classes that meet at night (one group online, the other face-to-face on our campus).  We would like to have separate instances of HUM125 for each of these 3 groups.\n\n\n\nThe ideal situation would be to have one main version of the course.  Any changes to it would automatically apply to all current and future instances of the course (but future only would be acceptable).  Any changes made to a course built from the master would trigger a popup box asking if the change should be applied to the master as well (if the teacher is listed as a teacher for the main course).\n\n\n\nWe would also like to be able to choose which sections of a course are shared between all instances of a course.  As an example: to reduce the possibility of cheating, we might want to modify quizzes for each instance, but to facilitate dialog, we might want some or all forums to be shared between instances.\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Friday,  27 December 2002, 02:16 PM:\n\nThe master/slave nuance would be very helpful.\n\n\n\nFor example, I teach an info law course that sometimes is pure-play online only, and a more traditional lecture + moodle component.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  13 February 2003, 10:49 PM:\n\nI think this object-oriented inheritance approach might be better solved by the groups implementation.\n\n\n\nI'd like this bug should stay focussed on proper backups.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday, 1 March 2003, 04:18 PM:\n\nXML looks like the way.\n\n\n\nAll the cross-referenced indexes need to be converted \n\ninto some neutral and internally consistent numbering \n\nsystem that can be translated to fit into any Moodle\n\nserver.  On restore there should be matching done \n\nbetween usernames etc to renumber them correctly.\n\n\n\nThe XML file should be saved in the course files \n\narea, so that the whole course directory can be \n\nzipped up and moved around.\n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Sunday, 2 March 2003, 12:40 AM:\n\nShould all modules have it's own backup/restore functions? At least restoring will need own logic for every module.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  22 March 2003, 10:59 AM:\n\nThis is very high priority now.\n\nFrom Mark Berthelemy (mberthelemy at mrbeducation.co.uk) Monday,  14 April 2003, 03:42 AM:\n\nThe XML structure you're suggesting to create copies of a whole Moodle course could also be used to create a SCORM compliant package - it would simply be a subset of the Moodle XML structure; containing just references to the course resources, rather than all the assignments etc.\n\n\n\nThis would allow Moodle users to transfer course content created in other VLEs, or in course authoring tools that can output SCORM compliant packages (eg. Dreamweaver with the Manifest Maker extension).\n\n\n\nIf you want to include Assignments and Choices in a SCORM package then Moodle will need to contain a SCORM compliant API adaptor and the Assignments etc will need to contain the correct javascript calls to the API. Probably not such a high priority at the moment...\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  14 April 2003, 09:59 AM:\n\nSomething to keep in mind for the future, definitely.  I've yet to find a real course encoded in SCORM format (there's only the very thin examples on the SCORM site)\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  16 April 2003, 06:57 PM:\n\nEloy Lafuente (stronk7) is going to have a try at this.  Go Eloy!\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  23 April 2003, 09:19 PM:\n\nSome ideas I wrote in an email a while back, which should be here for reference:\n\n\n\nMy rough idea is a single script course/backup.php\n\nthat allows you to select items like:\n\n\n\n  x assignments\n\n  x choices\n\n  x forums\n\n  x journals\n\n  x peer graded assignments\n\n  x quizzes\n\n  x resources\n\n  x surveys\n\n\n\n  x include enrolments\n\n    x include student-submitted information\n\n      x include full user accounts\n\n\n\n  x download the backup\n\n    x compress the backup as a zip file\n\n      x include uploaded files in final zip file\n\n\n\nwhich then creates a big xml file in the course files area\n\nwith a standard naming scheme like backup-courseshortname-ddmmyyy-hhmm.xml\n\n\n\nThe script can optionally create a new zip file of this backup xml\n\nfile, and optionally add all the course uploaded files to the\n\nsame zip, and then offer this zip as a download.\n\n\n\nThen later there would be a course/restore.php which does the same\n\nthing in reverse, roughly, allowing you to select parts that you want to restore into the current course.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Friday,  23 May 2003, 08:11 PM:\n\nINFORMATION FOR SUBSCRIBERS !!!!\n\nWell. I've advanced a bit since the last post to this bug.\n\nThe backup interface is finished and everything is backupable (except some mods).\n\nNow I've started the restore option.\n\nWhen I've finished its first executable (although limited) version, I'll inform you again.\n\nEvery comment will be welcome (tests included, of course).\n\nCiao.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday, 2 June 2003, 05:19 AM:\n\nINFORMATION FOR SUBSCRIBERS !!!!\n\n\n\nNow the restore seems to work with this limitations:\n\n\n\n- Logs are no restored.\n\n- Only assignments, choices, resources and surveys are\n\n  restored.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to complete (backup and restore) missing mods \n\n(forums, quizzes and workshops).\n\n\n\nAnd I need some help now:\n\n\n\n1st.) TEST, TEST, TEST and TEST !!\n\n2nd.) It will be VERY interesting for me to have some backups\n\n      (from you) to make my own tests.\n\n\n\nWhen I've finished new modules, I'll update this bug.\n\n\n\nCiao. \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday, 2 June 2003, 12:01 PM:\n\nCongratulations!!!\n\n\n\nI did a very quick run through of the process - overall it looks impressive so far - very clean interface.  I did run into some problems but I'll do a better test tonight and send you some backups!  :-) :-) :-)\n\nFrom Greg Barnett (gregb at crowncollege.edu) Thursday,  12 June 2003, 09:51 AM:\n\nI didn't get all the way through contrib/stronk7/backup/, due to a problem with my installation of PHP, but what I saw looks promising.  I'll try again once I've recompiled PHP with utf8 support.\n\n\n\nI'm going to recommend that someplace in the code you add a few configuration checks to make sure that the users PHP/Moodle installation is capable of making backups.\n\n\n\nsomething like the following:\n\nif(!function_exists('utf8_encode'){\n\n    error('You need to add utf8 support to your PHP installation');\n\n}\n\n\n\nhere is the output I'm getting now:\n\nCreating temporary structures\n\nDeteting old data\n\nCreating xml file\n\nWriting header\n\nWriting general info\n\nFatal error: Call to undefined function: utf8_encode() in /var/www/html/moodle/contrib/stronk7/backup/backuplib.php on line 295\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Friday,  13 June 2003, 01:48 AM:\n\nHi greb, I've included a backup_required_functions in lib.php. It's called always in backup/restore. It stops the process if something fails.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Friday,  13 June 2003, 01:54 AM:\n\nHi, everybody.\n\n\n\nI've finished the first executable version of backup/restore (backup everything, restore assignments, surveys, choices and resources).\n\n\n\nIt seems to work with small/medium courses without change and with big courses doing some mysql conf. tunning (I'll try to avoid this, later).\n\n\n\nNow I'm going to develop the restore forums, quizzes and journals.\n\n\n\nEvery test, comment or idea will be welcome !!\n\n\n\nTIA.\n\nFrom Gilberto Rodr?guez (giro at prodigy.net.mx) Thursday,  19 June 2003, 04:04 AM:\n\nHi Eloy\n\nI'm trying this.\n\nIt looks very nice.

Your moodle language is set to ?\n\n\n\nTIA\n\nFrom Jacob Romeyn (jacob at romeyn.org) Friday,  20 June 2003, 11:26 PM:\n\nThe language is set to enghlish\n\nFrom Gilberto Rodr?guez (giro at prodigy.net.mx) Friday,  20 June 2003, 11:40 PM:\n\nHi, looks the same.\n\nWeb Server: Apache Version 1.3.27\n\nOperating System: Linux Redhat Version 7.3\n\nroblem when backup-ing.\n\nI have my $datarrot outside web access with chmod 777 and works well for courses and users\n\nThere is not temp or backup inside.\n\nLanguaje: es\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Friday,  20 June 2003, 11:49 PM:\n\nOk. It seems to be two possible errors.\n\n\n\nThe first, language-related, occurs when the corresponding backupdir string in the current language is incorrect to be a dirname !!\n\n\n\nThe second, when you are trying to backup a course without its own dir in $dataroot (one dir is created once a course need to save any file, but it it isn't needed, the dir isn't created). All the backup process will work, but, when trying to save the backup-file to its final location (the course dir), is possible that it doesn't exist. I've to check it !!\n\n\n\nCan you confirm any of this possible errors in your installation. \n\n\n\nTIA\n\n\n\nPD: If you see that there is no course_dir under your $datarrot, you can try to upload a file with Moodle's FileManager. It'll force the creation of the dir.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, confirm !!\n\nFrom Gilberto Rodr?guez (giro at prodigy.net.mx) Saturday,  21 June 2003, 12:32 AM:\n\nSuccess!!!\n\nThe error message still appears, but the backup was created. I'll check for strings.\n\nSend you a backup image .jpg just check it's all right, look at the top of page in Attachments section.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Saturday,  21 June 2003, 12:52 AM:\n\nGood !!\n\n\n\nThe files in the .jpg seems to be correct.\n\n\n\nBut the error persists. Can you make this:\n\n\n\n1-Can you send me a jpg (or html) with the backup progress ?\n\n1-Go to course table and look for the id (ID) of your course.\n\n2-Look under $dataroot and look for a dir with that ID name.\n\n\n\nDoes it exist ?\n\n\n\nIf not, create it by going to the Files option into the course.\n\n\n\nDoes it exist now ?\n\n\n\nBackup the course and send me  the result page, please !!\n\n\n\nTIA.\n\nFrom Gilberto Rodr?guez (giro at prodigy.net.mx) Saturday,  21 June 2003, 01:40 AM:\n\nI hope this is the image you want.\n\nAll the folder exists and work, I upload files using file manager and works OK.\n\nThe backup itself looks to work fine, the directory is created, and data created into it.\n\nFrom Gilberto Rodr?guez (giro at prodigy.net.mx) Saturday,  21 June 2003, 01:43 AM:\n\nI've also tryed in english an receive the same result.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Saturday,  21 June 2003, 03:57 AM:\n\nNEWS:\n\n=====\n\nImportant changes in backup/restore internals.\n\nChanged 100% db temp storage to fs temp storage.\n\nAvoid a lot of limits and timeouts.\n\nMore checks are included.\n\n\n\nNow I'm going to develop the restore of the rest of modules:\n\n- Journals (simple)\n\n- Forums (hard work)\n\n- Quizzes (HEAVY)  :-)\n\n\n\nI've included some minor debug output to check the mkdir() problem. Please, update the backup/restore utility (it must be 0.6.1 alpha) and execute the backup process again (giro and jacob).

I'm just about to add a new column to the course table called visible.  For now, and for future reference, can you explain the procedure for adding a new column like this wrt backup/restore?\n\n\n\na) It looks like old backups can still be imported into future versions and just have default values for this column ...  Is this the case?\n\n\n\nb) Do I just need to add an entry to backup_course_start() in http://moodle.cvs.sourceforge.net/moodle/moodle/backup/backuplib.php and restore_create_new_course() in http://moodle.cvs.sourceforge.net/moodle/moodle/backup/restorelib.php ?\n\n\n\nAs every time I look into the backup code I am deeply impressed with the amount of work you've put into this in such a short time.\n\n\n\nCheers!\n\nMartin\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday,  21 July 2003, 02:37 AM:\n\nOk. Here is an introduction to the backup/restore internals.\n\n\n\nIf you want to add a new field in the course structure to the utility, first of all you musk know where to do it. If the change is in a main table, you have to modify backup/backuplib.php and backup/restorelib.php. If the change is in a module related table, you have to modify backuplib.php and restorelib.php inside the module directory.\n\n\n\nSecond you must know what type of field you are going to add. If the field is just an attribute of the table and it is independent (not pointing to the primary key in another table, neither a 'serialized' field), simply add it in the backuplib.php with the rest of fields of the table) and add it in the restorelib.php (a bit more complicated, see below) with the rest of the fields of the table). For example, to add the 'visible' field in the course backup you must add a:\n\n\n\nfwrite ($bf,full_tag(VISIBLE,3,false,$course->visible));\n\n\n\nWhere the rest of the course fields are written (in the 'backup_course_start' function).\n\n\n\nTo restore it, just add:\n\n\n\n      case VISIBLE:\n\n          $this->info->course_visible = $this->getContents();\n\n          break;\n\n\n\nIn the 'endElementCourseHeader' function to read the value from XML and add:\n\n\n\n$course->visible = addslashes($course_header->course_visible);\n\n\n\nIn the 'restore_create_new_course' to save the field to db.\n\n\n\nThe reason of this in that writing to XML is done in a one phase process, but reading and saving to db is done in two phases.\n\n\n\nRestoring modules info is easier, because I use the 'infamous' xmlize function (memory eater!!) to read everything automatically from xml and there is only on required phase to save it to DB.\n\n\n\nAll of this is to add a simple, independent field. If the field points to another table or it's a complex field (the answer field in quiz_responses, for example) or it's a serialized field (the modinfo field in course) or it needs some validation, then the above guidelines are valid to backup but insufficient to restore. After restoring, it will be necessary to to some recoding or post process of the info, saving it to the temporary backup tables if it's going to be used after that). \n\n\n\nAnd this is the first introduction to the code. I hope you understand it (my English is really awful).\n\n\n\nIn the next post to this bug, I'll answer your a & b questions.\n\n\n\nCiao.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday,  21 July 2003, 02:55 AM:\n\nHi Martin. Abouy your questions two posts above:\n\n\n\na) I think that adding new 'independent' fields to the restore maintains compatibility with old backups if you specify a default value for that field (if the ADOB library or the RDBS put that value when the field is null). I always use the insert_record, and its code seems to take care of null values, using the 'default' one if it exists.\n\n\n\nThe backwards compatibility problem can appear when the new field a relation or serialized one, and it's a not optional one or when moodle db representation change a lot. For example, if now we create a new question type, it will not affect compatibility, because old backups doesn't have that type of questions), but if you change the way quiz_numerical are in db, backwards compatibility will be broken !!.\n\n\n\nb) I hope that I've answered this in my previous post !! For any question, you know where to contact me. :-)\n\n\n\nAnd finally, two comments:\n\n\n\nI think that the main reason you are 'deeply impressed with the amount of work' is that this is my fist 100+ lines php script and I'm learning every day. I'm sure it can be tons of lines small.\n\n\n\n:-)\n\n\n\nSee you, Eloy.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday,  21 July 2003, 02:59 AM:\n\nOh, I forgot my second comment !!\n\n\n\n... smaller and BETTER. Sure !!\n\n\n\nI'm a simple Oracle, Java and Mac developer. :-)\n\n\n\nCiao.\n\nFrom Jacob Romeyn (jacob at romeyn.org) Tuesday,  22 July 2003, 10:45 AM:\n\nre my question on the pictures not restoring I had not backed them up, my mistake. \n\n\n\nAn other observation when backing up a course. Hidden files are not backed up. At least not the chat module.\n\nI had two hidden chat modules installed and when I restored the file they where not present as hidden files but gone altogether.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Tuesday,  22 July 2003, 11:17 PM:\n\nHi Jacob.\n\n\n\nAt this time, workshop and chat modules are not included in the backup/restore utility. The main reason is that they aren't 'stable' modules yet. \n\n\n\nI think that the rest of included modules (showed or hidden) are backuped and restored fine !!\n\n\n\nNow I'm working into adding language suppor to the utility. When I'll finish that, I'll start working in workshop and chat modules (I'll confirm the DB stability of them with Martin, of course).\n\n\n\nSorry and ciao, Eloy.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  22 July 2003, 11:26 PM:\n\nJust a note - I used the backup today for a real purpose - I had to create a new empty shell of a course for a new year on smec.moodle.com.   I did a backup without user data and restored it to a new course - no problem at all - smooth as smooth - nice job!   The Moodle interface can use a little work (ie that admin File Manager we talked about ... one day).\n\n\n\nI should also add that there are going to be lots of database changes over the next couple of weeks - I'll do my best to keep backup/restore functional.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  23 July 2003, 06:12 AM:\n\nOh !! A lot of DB changes !!\n\n\n\nOK. I'll continue with language support...\n\n\n\nIf you need assistance with the changes in backup..tell me.\n\n\n\nCiao.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  23 July 2003, 06:17 AM:\n\nI've detected a bug in the restore process:\n\n\n\nWhen restoring a course with its modules wit user data, but only restoring course users, if a user has been unenrolled from the course some errors will appear.\n\n\n\nI don't know what to to.

Next to each participant name there would be a field with one or several check-boxes (a bit like the attendance module with check-boxes for Present, Tardee, Absent).\n\n\n\nOften there may be a lot of different personnel involved with different tasks in distance education environment, and records have to be kept of many kinds of information about the students participating. In our environment e.g. students are admitted to begin a course before the course fee is paid, but later on the teacher needs to know if all the participants have paid the course fee; then it would be convenient if the bureau officer in charge of fees could be given access to moodle and use the student-check-box-list to continously check off all the students that already have paid, in order for the teacher to get an easy overview of that.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  15 March 2006, 02:53 AM:\n\nAt York I introduced such a feature a while ago and it has made a big difference to our interaction with students. Students are impressed when we apparently remember small details about them which in reality we just look up in our notes about them. I realized this just as a tab on the user profile page.\n\n\n\nHere every teacher can keep their own private notes on each student, therefore it is not realized as just an extra field on the user table but as a new table mdl_note with fields id, teacherid, userid, text.",

    "Description": "One concern using online quizes in a live course is potential for abuse.  I think many administrations, especially, will voice this as a concern for course content.  \n\n\n\nOne idea I have had to address the issue is to require students to request a key from the instructor.  \n\n\n\nThe instructor could issue a key that will be required to open a quiz session.\n\n\n\nUse of a key will at least provide an additional layer of authentication of the user, as well perhaps the ability to track other info for each quiz session.\n\n\n\nThe problem is not solvable technically, I believe.  Relying on an online session for voting, graded quizes, etc., necessarily rely on a level of trust of the user.  \n\n\n\nHowever, maybe things like asking user to fill in some info would be helpful in deterring cheating.  Info such as: where are you taking this quiz, some personal information to use as a tag or or token, recording browser/IP info.\n\n\n\nI'm not especially concerned with the cheating issue now, as I generally opt to trust students rather than not, and I've discounted the value of the quizes to minimize the impact of a potential cheater..\n\n\n\nThoughts?",

They're only cheating themselves really, aren't they?\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Saturday, 5 October 2002, 12:02 AM:\n\nI think using the same register with token method to start the quiz would accomplish what I'm getting at.\n\n\n\nI think it would deter alot of casual cheating and prevent people from taking it over and over again.  Bascially, if you give a student a token and say, here is your key.  I'll know it's yours when someone logs on, I think it's likely to make them think twice.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  22 October 2002, 12:36 PM:\n\nStudents are already prevented from taking it over and over, and we know who it is because they have to be logged in.\n\n\n\nCan I close this bug now?\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Sunday,  24 August 2003, 01:17 PM:\n\nI think there's reasons to have the feature.  It's not a crucial element however.\n\n\n\nI think you could think of it in the same vein as why do you need a token to take a course, you can always kick them out..\n\n\n\nIt's DRM for the tests basically.",

I currently don't have enough records to perform any meaningful benchmarks, but someone with lots of real world data in their database could try using my phproof (in contrib/crown_college/phproof) script to see if adding any indexes helps or hurts (on insert/update) performance.\n\nFrom Greg Barnett (gregb at crowncollege.edu) Wednesday,  26 March 2003, 07:34 AM:\n\nNow that I've had Moodle running for a few months, I have some real world data to test out indexes with.\n\n\n\nViewing activity logs was getting really really slow (minutes to build a page).  The log table has hundreds of thousands of entries.  Adding indexes to the userid and course fields improved the performance by many many orders of magnitude.\n\n\n\nI suspect that adding indexes to appropriate fields in the queried tables might also help out with MDL-314.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  26 March 2003, 10:25 AM:\n\nLove it.

S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Monday,  20 January 2003, 07:35 AM:\n\nIt should also be possible to clear the current selected list *without* sending an email (in case the teacher changes his/her mind). Possibly a Clear Send-To List button on the mail students page.\n\n\n\nOr, even better, this mail students page would have a list of all students enrolled in the course showing their current status on the mail-to list (selected or not), plus ability to change status for any student on the list as well as buttons to select all and de-select all.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  13 April 2003, 02:27 PM:\n\nThe list would be maintained in the global session variable.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  15 March 2006, 02:57 AM:\n\nThis is in Moodle 1.6 so I am closing this (just a bit of house cleaning in the bug tracker).",

I know that you can go to the participants and select students and add a message; however, I do not believe that this has been implemented throughout Moodle. In particular, two places where I would like to see it implemented are on the assignment submissions screen. This would allow a teacher to see which students had not submitted an assignment, check their names and send them a reminder to complete the assignment. Similarly, using the boxes next to the names in the quiz module attempts screen would be helpful for the same reason. Should I create a separate feature request for each of those or would it be better to re-open this request? Peace - Anthony"

Surely this is not too much to ask lawyers to do, is it?\n\n\n\nor you could just use the upcoming quiz module!!!!   Dammit!  :-)\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Friday,  11 October 2002, 11:45 PM:\n\nRe: what about no access to filesystem or editor?\n\n\n\nAs I have discovered to my chagrin the students are neither, lawyers nor technologists... `)  (I have poked out my own other eye at this point)\n\n\n\nI agree that cut copying and pasting to new document somewhere is fine.  However, consider that some environments might have limited software available, no access to file systems... etc.  The process of creating a dependence on the local editing and file system would be better avoided, no?\n\n\n\nAlso if you there were a PHP based editing solution, a teacher could submit a writing or other assigment to a new record in assignment.description (or make a new table maybe?), the student could edit the content of assignment.<The Text of the Assignment> and save to assignment.submissions, then the Teacher could annotate the assignment.submissions?\n\n\n\nThemes could be defined to colorcode the diffs of the files so you could get a page and scroll throgh the original questiosn, students responses, and teachers replies..\n\n\n\noh.. or I could use the quiz module.. :)\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Friday,  18 October 2002, 10:59 AM:\n\nMartin,\n\n\n\nI wanted to followup this point again in reference to http://bugs.moodle.org/bug.php?op=show&bugid=133.\n\n\n\nYou suggest that students ought rely on word to collaborate on writing.  I think that dependency is problematic for a number of reasons, but in general allowing for HTML text entry in the collabotive writing/journal, and even assignment areas is needed.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  18 October 2002, 11:23 AM:\n\nEr, not quite - in MDL-133 I suggested Word only as a *workaround* for a specific case.  (You could use any word processor, eg StarOffice).  In fact MDL-133 is about a NEW module designed for collaborative writing!\n\n\n\nHTML text entry is already implemented for Journals (in CVS and 1.0.6).  Of course the WYSIWYG editor itself suffers from a dependency (IE 5.5 and later)\n\n\n\nI still disagree that the Assignment module is a place for editing documents or collaborating ... it's meant to be a drop box for already-written long documents.\n\n\n\nHave you tried the quiz module yet?  It's working now you know.  :-)\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Sunday,  20 October 2002, 09:33 AM:\n\nwhat's the IE dependency in the Journal HTML function?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  20 October 2002, 11:31 AM:\n\nI believe it's the use of scriptlets.  Apparently similar features will be implemented in Mozilla 1.2 or 1.3 but until then it's IE only.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 9 February 2003, 10:41 PM:\n\nReopening this to cover an online assignment type.\n\n\n\nThis will replace the journal eventually .. see MDL-285\n\nFrom Yu Zhang (yu at moodle.com) Thursday,  13 April 2006, 11:31 AM:\n\nclosing this too.",

I'll keep that in mind.\n\n\n\nYou could also use an assignment module or a forum to exchange Word documents, and do the markup using Word tools.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  16 October 2002, 03:49 PM:\n\nIn fact, I think what we're talking about here is a new module designed for collaborative writing, in which the same document is worked on and annotated by two or more authors.  I'll change the description.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  12 July 2003, 11:29 PM:\n\nHow much of this is the new Library function, do you think, Tom?\n\nFrom tom murdock (tom at thinkingdistance.org) Sunday,  13 July 2003, 08:08 PM:\n\nYes and no. The code is there, but it would need to be reconstructed I think, if we are talking about the revised assignment (that tracks multiple versions).\n\n\n\nI imagine if the student edited a page (that was essentially organized like a Library page) a teacher (and other students) could comment on the writing.  But somehow this should be some kind of private act, I imagine, between the people involved.  Maybe part of this new assignment module would be about creating permissions for the people involved in the workshop process?\n\n\n\nI think the pages are already set up to save as versions (which is good), but the comments should probably connect to specific versions  (rather than the most recent version).\n\n\n\nI suspect the journal grading scheme would need to be included (between writer and teacher), too.  \n\n\n\nI think Mark has all the code inside Library, but it might take some scalpel work.\n\nFrom tom murdock (tom at thinkingdistance.org) Monday, 9 February 2004, 06:36 AM:\n\nLooks like some folks are slowly working on collaborative modules. I'll close this.",

All posts before that time are hidden, all posts after are shown.  Another button Show all posts would show everything again.\n\nFrom P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Tuesday,  25 March 2003, 11:19 PM:\n\nI think there has been a discussion about this, though I can't find it in the forums. If I remember correctly, it finished with a question how to treat messages which students receive as forum subscription.\n\n\n\nIn the case of a non-subscribed forum this is simple - messages that the student has not seen are marked as unread.\n\n\n\nIn the case of forums the student is subscribed to, I think the messages should not be marked as either read or unread. We can assume that if a message has been sent, it is treated as read - I realize this doesn't have to be actually read, but isn't it the same with the unsubscribed forums? (messages are displayed, we can never be sure they have been read)\n\n\n\nInstead of marking those subscribed messages as read there could be a setting in the user profile with a number of days a message is marked as new\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  13 April 2003, 02:08 PM:\n\nFor reference, that was this thread:  <A href=http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=632>Viewed xx times</A>\n\n\n\nMy main problem with this whole problem is the amount of data it causes to remember each post for each person.\n\n\n\nBut I like the functionality, so I need to find a shortcut.\n\n\n\nThe option to only flag messages from the last x days is not bad, though obviously once you've read them all they still will be flagged).  A better way of implementing this might be with an extended page of recent activity, like the log on the course page but organised better to give you a better view of what's been happening.\n\n\n\nAnother idea is to store a flag for every post+user, but only store the data for a short time.  When a posting is made, a table is filled with UNREAD flags for each user currently subscribed.  As they read them (via web or mail) then these flags are removed entirely.  After 30 days (or some admin-specified period) any UNREAD flags still existing can be deleted by cron.\n\n\n\nJust some ideas to think about.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  12 July 2003, 11:39 PM:\n\nStill important, but won't make 1.1\n\nFrom Enrique Castro (ecastro at dbbf.ulpgc.es) Sunday,  18 July 2004, 03:08 AM:\n\nHi, \n\nin some forum discussion I have not been able to reacall there has been proposed to use the message rating system. to flag the forums. \n\n\n\nI have been using a custom scale for forum ratings: readed/come back/interesting/delayed/erasable\n\n\n\nBy definition, messages with a rate have been read. And can be established that \n\n\n\nI suggest that the rating mechanisms is duplicated, and  one used as a message flagging system. To be fully functional, the interface should include global buttons to rate all messages in a discussion (all them, disregarding previous rate, or only yet-unrated messages), and to sort/display the messages by rate\n\n\n\nI think this would add only a new field (an not a very large one) to the Moodle forum database. \n\n\n\n\n\nEnrique Castro\n\n\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  15 March 2006, 03:04 AM:\n\nThis is in Moodle 1.5",

However, I had a request for a PHP little gui front-end to this process.  I can see this being of paritcular value for users unfamiliar (or without access) to the database backend.\n\n\n\nI considering a comma deliminated or otehr format for batch creation would be useful dialogue, and move towards impelemnting a front-end so someone can select a file with course info and interate through the contents to populate appropriate fields.\n\n\n\nThis is a real world request.  I'm looking at 200-1000 courses in the next 3 months... I keep telling them I'm an attorney but they love my smile.. I'm thinking of hacking something in Perl for short-term as I don't know PHP text processing..  ;)\n\n\n\nComments, thoughts?  thanks..",

He demonstrates he knew hte right answer.  I'd like to go in and edit his response to a question.\n\n\n\nCould I do this just by editing the gross score, yes, but again it's nice to edit the question and let moodle do the scoring.\n\n\n\nSomething else that occurs to me onthis point, is how to handle curving grades.  I don't think this is real crucial to me but it certainly is meat and potatoes for undergrad classes especially.\n\n\n\nAssuming a teacher wants to discount or inflate all responses by 1.5 what woudl be the best way to handle?  Is it a feature that makes sense?\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Wednesday,  23 October 2002, 09:17 PM:\n\nSorry, to add to this thread.  I may think that an indiviual quiz question is just a bad question and want to give everyone credit for it.\n\n\n\nWhat's the best way to implement that?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  23 October 2002, 09:20 PM:\n\nYou can make all the answers worth 100% and then do a regrade.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  23 October 2002, 09:23 PM:\n\nThe curving business is definitely something that will be coming in the grades page (ie calculated grades where you enter formulas), as well as manual grade columns (hand entered).\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Sunday, 9 May 2004, 10:06 AM:\n\nGood to see this will be taken care of in the grades package.\n\n\n\nAs always, ganbatte Mah-tin.. :)\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  15 March 2006, 03:07 AM:\n\nYour requirements will probably be met by the future manual grading feature.

Let the teacher decide how many questions there should be on such a page. This goes well with http://moodle.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=508\n\n\n\nSo, my suggestion is:\n\n- paged quizzes\n\n- disallow/allow backtracking\n\n- one or more questions per page\n\n- intro textblock editable with wysiwyg editor on top of the page (see discussion 508)\n\n\n\nPS\n\nIs there a behaviour code here in bug-tracker? What we can do here, and what you'd rather we didn't do? I've changed the priority of this bug.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday, 6 January 2003, 08:25 PM:\n\nI'm starting to think my new tracker module for Moodle should have the highest priority (because I don't like this interface much and I don't think anyone else does either. :-)\n\n\n\nFeel free to do whatever is possible ... I currently only use priorities etc as a guide anyway.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  11 August 2004, 07:33 PM:\n\nMy thoughts about this are to store the results in the session variable in a nice structure.  \n\n\n\nmod/quiz/attempt.php would be repeatedly called with the new data from a question, and it would save the data into the session variable, then display the next question, and so on.\n\n\n\nAlmost all the code should be in attempt.php ... there might need to be one more function to display questions alone.\n\n\n\nAt the end, all the accumulated session data is then taken and dealt with at once just like the current attempt.php works.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 7 May 2005, 01:13 AM:\n\nThe paged quizzes we do of course have now, but the no-backtracking option we do not so I have renamed this feature request.",

      "26/Aug/11 3:38 PM;712020:12b8a5be-52e9-4011-9899-f023474e5c79;Yes, but it would still be helpful to have this feature in the quizzes as the lesson serves  purposes other than giving quizzes. In fact, it's fairly unintuitive to ask users to use the lesson tool to create certain quizzes if they want certain quiz functionality such as backtracking. Could we possibly re-open this?",

From time to time people ask for this in the quiz forum, so there is a demand out there, although it is small.\n\nNote that Moodle 2.1+ makes this easier.

    "Description": "The way that the assignments are right now is that you can have the offline assignment where only a score is given, or upload a file to be graded.  I think another assignment type would be handy where students can input their work right into the assignment, and the instructor can grade it from moodle later.  This would be much like the journal entries, only with a numerical grade attatched to it, and listed as an Assignment as well.",

      "05/Mar/04 3:46 PM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Greg Barnett (gregb at crowncollege.edu) Wednesday,  18 December 2002, 06:51 AM:\n\nI am currently working on modifications to admin/cron.php to give it the ability to handle backups.\n\n\n\nOne related bug, is that admin/cron.php when called by the command line version of php results in error messages:\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n<b>Warning</b>:  Cannot send session cookie - headers already sent in <b>/var/www/html/moodle/lib/setup.php</b> on line <b>114</b><br />\n\n<br />\n\n<b>Warning</b>:  Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent (output started at /var/www/html/moodle/lib/setup.php:114) in <b>/var/www/html/moodle/lib/setup.php</b> on line <b>114</b><br />\n\n<P align=center><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Error: could not find web server variable: $HTTP_HOST</FONT></B></P>\n\n<P align=center><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Error: Could not find any of these web server variables: $REQUEST_URI, $PATH_INFO or $PHP_SELF</FONT></B></P>\n\n<PRE>\n\nProcessing post 21 ... mailed to 11 users ...\n\nCron script completed correctly\n\n\n\nI will be attempting to remedy those errors as I add in backup functionality.\n\nFrom Greg Barnett (gregb at crowncollege.edu) Wednesday,  18 December 2002, 03:01 PM:\n\nPutting the backup functionality into cron.php didn't work out as well as I had hoped.\n\n\n\nThe scope of the project grew to beyond what I wanted to deal with when I started to determine just how many files would need to be modified in order for cron.php to work with the command line version of php.\n\n\n\nInstead of doing something integrated, I just put together a cheesy hack, and put it into CVS as contrib/crown_college/backup/backup.php\n\n\n\nAt some point I still would like to go back and make the changes required to make cron.php work from the command line.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  18 December 2002, 04:10 PM:\n\nI'd never noticed those cron.php errors coming up because the error messages are fairly recent.\n\n\n\nThey are easily fixed by putting a conditional on the line in setup.php:\n\n\n\n$FULLME = qualified_me();\n\n\n\neg \n\n\n\nif (!$FULLME) { \n\n  $FULLME = qualified_me();\n\n}\n\n\n\nThen of course, in cron.php you just set FULLME to something bogus.\n\n\n\nI'll do this later in the week with the other library changes ... (can't check in setup.php right now)\n\nFrom Greg Barnett (gregb at crowncollege.edu) Thursday,  19 December 2002, 01:58 AM:\n\nI had actually started to work on something similar to what follows:\n\n\n\nif(isset($_SERVER[argv][0])) {\n\n    $CFG->accessedby = 'CLI';\n\n} elseif(isset($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']){\n\n    $CFG->accessedby = 'HTTP'\n\n}\n\n\n\nsetup_for_$CFG->accessedby()\n\n\n\nsetup_for_CLI() would skip the session_start.\n\n\n\nI didn't want to make the changes cron.php specific, as I tend to do lots of command line testing/benchmarking when developing.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday, 1 October 2003, 03:28 AM:\n\nThis seems to be a old issue. I have seen some related information in Moodle's forums and Moodle documentation (http://moodle.org/doc/?file=faq.html#backup). That should be sufficient !!\n\n\n\nPlease, reopen it as necessary\n\n\n\nCiao, Eloy :-)",

      "13/Apr/06 7:33 PM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Saturday,  28 December 2002, 07:41 AM:\n\nHi Martin!\n\n\n\nI've been thinking about this module for some time now so I might just as well jump in here with my two cents. Here are my suggestions:\n\n\n\nI would make three options for student-editing: 1/ editable by students, 2/ not editable by students, and 3/ editable by students but with teacher approval (the entry does not become visible in the database until it has been approved).\n\nAre you planning to allow the student-editing options on whole records only, or on individual fields as well (thus allowing the teacher to enter the data into some fields and allow students to fill in the other fields for the given record)?\n\n\n\nAnother setting for the module: allow students to create new records (or delete existing ones) or allow them to complete existing records only (only the teacher creates records).\n\n\n\nTwo kinds of views: 1/ table overview, 2/ record view\n\n\n\nWhat field types are you thinking of?\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nPrzemek\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  29 December 2002, 06:57 PM:\n\nAll those ideas sound good.\n\n\n\nProbably 'text' and 'number' field types would be enough to start with.\n\nFrom P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Friday, 3 January 2003, 06:08 AM:\n\nA few suggestions more:\n\n\n\nA search facility? Searching by fields (i.e. search for and display records where the X field includes to Y value).\n\n\n\nHow about a file field that would allow users to upload/download files?\n\n\n\nAnd a table field which could hold a few values (maximum number set by teacher)? This would allow for a very limited and primitive relational-database capability. E.g. a collaborative dictionary could have records where for each word there are a few definitions.\n\n\n\nI would also expand the capabilities of the text field and create a few options for this field: url, email. For example, If a teacher defines a field as text(e-mail), whatever is entered in the field is enclosed within the a href=mailo: tag. Taking this even further, the site admin might be able to add new types of text field options, thus enabling great flexibility.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  13 May 2003, 12:39 PM:\n\nA 'table' field is unnecessary, I think, since the basic module will let you define any number of fields you need.\n\n\n\nSearch, yes, good idea.\n\n\n\nFile, maybe.\n\n\n\nOther field types, yes. They won't need to be subdefined under text.  eg a field type menu could include:\n\n\n\nshort text\n\nlong text\n\nemail\n\nweb address\n\nnumber\n\npicture\n\nuploaded file\n\netc...\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  10 September 2003, 01:15 PM:\n\nThe short text field could be forced to be unique, and then used by other processes as a way to refer to the entry.  For example, forum texts could be parsed for these words and have links added.\n\nFrom Chardelle Busch (chardelle at lifeworkouts.com) Monday,  23 August 2004, 12:21 AM:\n\nPlease keep in mind I'm adding these comments with no coding knowledge, so this would be from a user perspective.  \n\n1.  Include radio button/checkbox type of fields to which teacher can assign values (this could be used to create customized feedback questionnaires--no offense Martin, your questionnaires are great but not suitable for all environments). \n\n2.  Have an option for where the data goes.  E.g., the submit button will send the data to: the teacher's email address, the student's email address, the data table(s), or any combination thereof.  \n\n3.  Have the ability to give feedback similar to other assignments (this could be used, for example, as an essay/blue book type of quiz with a multi-line text field).  \n\nFrom Chardelle Busch (chardelle at lifeworkouts.com) Monday,  23 August 2004, 12:40 AM:\n\nI can think of so many uses for this module.  Here's another idea--there's been so much talk about a progress type of feature.  Couldn't this also be used for that?  The ability to add a checkbox to an activity that is either checked by the user, checked by the teacher, or checked automatically--e.g. when a quiz has been taken. \n\n\n\nAlso, Martin, you are coming at this from the back-end by calling it the data module.  It seems to me that it makes more sense to call it the Forms Module--coming at it from the perspective of the user.  So, that the teacher is adding a form or form field(s) to a course rather than adding data?\n\n\n\nBy the way, Char, is me Chardelle.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  23 August 2004, 10:40 AM:\n\nYour first list of three suggestions are all good.\n\n\n\nThe reason it's called the data module is because the main purpose is to build up a collection of data.  Generally this is meant to be browseable by everyone, whereas I notice that most of your applications are private to each student.  That could be supported later but it does complicate matters.\n\n\n\nThis module would not be useful for the progress stuff ... that needs to be implemented in the Moodle core.\n\nFrom Yu Zhang (yu at moodle.com) Thursday,  13 April 2006, 11:33 AM:\n\nclosing this too. datamodule in 1.6",

(p_stencel at wp.pl) Sunday, 5 January 2003, 04:30 PM:\n\nIn fact, it is not a duplicate of MDL-155. 155 mentions only language choice on signup form (taking effect after login), whereas here ed means the ability to choose a language by a user who has not signed up yet (or is not going to sign up at all, but to use moodle site as a guest).\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 5 January 2003, 04:45 PM:\n\nFair enough ... it's not clear from the descriptions, but I'm actually thinking of solving both problems with one solution.  \n\n\n\nThe user chooses the language from a menu, and this affects both the guest view and the default language for the new account.\n\n\n\nThe menu would be something like the one currently on the documentation page (see: http://moodle.com/doc )\n\n\n\nOne problem I have is where to PUT this menu.  On the home page it might clutter up the 99% of sites that are mono-language.  So I was thinking of putting the menu on the login page.\n\n\n\nWhere do you think it should go?\n\nFrom P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Sunday, 5 January 2003, 05:02 PM:\n\nThe language choice dropdown menu would be perfect.\n\n\n\nHowever, if you put the choice on the login page - what about the users who are not intending to log in?\n\n\n\nI'd make it an option for the site admin - display language choice on homepage or not. Then it would not affect the 99% of sites. What do you think?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 5 January 2003, 05:09 PM:\n\nOK, how about under the blocks on the left side?\n\n\n\nI think it should also go on the login and signup pages ... just in case they missed it.  :-)\n\nFrom P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Sunday, 5 January 2003, 05:18 PM:\n\nImagine a non-native speaker opening the page in a foreign language. Will s/he bother to scroll down and search the whole page for a way to switch the language? I think most probably s/he will assume the page is in that language and leave...\n\n\n\nI would put it in a place where it would be immediately visible - how about in the top-right corner, next to the login link? :-D\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 5 January 2003, 05:34 PM:\n\nYes, it should fit there I guess. I'll see what I can do.  Thanks for your input.\n\nFrom   (ed at pacificstream.com) Sunday, 5 January 2003, 07:23 PM:\n\nYes, next to the Login link seems logical to me. Cheers\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  20 January 2003, 04:31 PM:\n\nChanges in CVS now mean you can add ?lang=xx to any URL in Moodle and the SESSION language will be set to that language will be set.  I hope this won't be confusing.\n\n\n\nThe current page language is now determined like this:\n\n\n\nif session languag is defined, use it, otherwise\n\nif user language is defined then use it, otherwise\n\nuse site language\n\n\n\nYou can see this in action on moodle.com (front page) try it out, have a play and let me know if you think this is sufficient.\n\nFrom   (ed at pacificstream.com) Monday,  20 January 2003, 05:34 PM:\n\nIt certainly seems to work ok in the senario I was thinking of. Not the most elegant, but I can see that millions of flags might cause a problem.",

(p_stencel at wp.pl) Tuesday, 7 January 2003, 08:12 AM:\n\nAfter giving it a second thought, I guess the two links to statistics should behave a little differently. The one in the quiz editing table would show question statistics for the current quiz only, whereas the link in the question pool table should bring up the statistics for this question gathered from all quizzes in which the question is used.\n\nFrom Sean Keogh (s.keogh at oxilp.ac.uk) Wednesday, 8 January 2003, 12:31 AM:\n\nYup, I can see that being very useful, as a good overview would point to any deficiencies in the understanding of the students, and hence to weaknesses in the teaching.\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Thursday,  11 September 2003, 01:30 PM:\n\nWhen doing load's of language tests (language learning is a process of trial and error, a series of tests in a sense) it is useful to be able to see the common mistakes.

    "Description": "This bug depends on MDL-232\n\n\n\nAdditionally, on question statistics for short answer questions there should be an easy way to add one of the incorrect answers as partially correct. Confusing, I know, so let me give you an example:\n\n\n\nQuestion:Paraphrase the sentence 'It appears that we have no bread left.' Start your paraphrase with 'We seem to', finish it with 'bread' and use the word RUN.\n\n\n\nAnswer: We seem to have run out of bread. (100%)\n\n\n\nIn the statistics table the teacher can view all the answers that the students gave to that question and how many students gave the same answer. S/he notices that quite a lot of students answered We seem to run out of bread. This obviously is incorrect (tense), but the teacher might decide to credit the students with, say, 50% - for recalling the run out of structure.",

Instead s/he will be able to grade this question for all students in one place (maybe statistics page from MDL-232 ?).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, since paragraph question will not have any predefined correct answers, when grading this type of question, the teacher should be able to set a few of the students' answers as model answers.

We have a teaching link with their law faculty, and one of our staff was over there before Christmas and was shown the system.  From looking at the documentation http://www.monash.edu.au/interlearn/index.html\n\nI certainly want to stick with moodle, but perhaps it would be a good idea to add this feature...either as a question type in quizzes, *or* (as interlearn does it) as a self-contained resource (or activity, as they term it).\n\n\n\nIt would be like the assignment resource type, but the student submission would be in a text box, rather than as an uploaded file.

At the moment there are off-line and uploaded (single file) assignments. This could be called an online assignment. The students (or groups) would get their own file storage area (with upper limits set by site admin or teacher).\n\n\n\nI imagine two ways of building the presentation:\n\n1/ Students create the presentation (which could consist of a few html pages linked together) off-line and then upload it in a zip file, unzip it and decide which file (if not index.htm) is the homepage of the presentation.\n\n2/ Students upload necessary media files and create the presentation online using the rich-text editor. There should be some way to let them create a few pages and link them together.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  22 January 2003, 12:53 PM:\n\nPerhaps both.   \n\n\n\nFirst, a files or portfolio tool that lets them upload/download/edit etc etc in their personal and also in their group areas.  \n\n\n\nThen a presentation tool which lets each student /group specify a URL (offsite) or a a file (from their files area) which is presented in a nice list so that everyone in the class can browse and possibly rate/comment on each.\n\n\n\nThirdly a new assignment type that instead of requiring an upload, requires they pick a file from their file area or an external URL.\n\nFrom   (jordi at uji.es) Friday,  24 January 2003, 05:00 AM:\n\nA portfolio module will be great, but I see it also linked to a learning journal or similar. Portfolio= digital artifacts (files, HTML or not) + reflection about how these artifacts show evidence of learning (as defined in the course objetives) . A tool like this will be useful also to articulate the course around student projects. We also can use some HTML templates to help students to and rubrics to autoevaluation.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  24 January 2003, 06:03 PM:\n\nPortfolio might not be such a good name then ... I was thinking more like a library, a shelf, a bin, a locker, a storage place.\n\n\n\nStudent portfolios can of course be constructed elsewhere (such as the new super-journal) ... or perhaps in a special new portfolio module.\n\n\n\nArtifacts in the library will be available throughout Moodle to link to.   So for example a Journal entry can link to files in their area.\n\n\n\nI think if the functionality is split like this it allows more powerful combinations later on.  What do you think?\n\nFrom   (jordi at uji.es) Monday,  27 January 2003, 07:16 AM:\n\nA storage place for students and groups files will be great.",

I suppose unresolved feelings about their mother.. fear of heights..  :)\n\n\n\nI suppose the most common situation that's arose is, student is working at their office and can't submit the assignment, but can emailme the file.  If I can go to the feedback page I can dump the file there, give feedback, and grade..\n\n\n\nApparently, there are several individuals who have trouble accessing moodle from behind firewalls.  At this point I have concluded it's more user error than anything else, and have stopped exploring.\n\nFrom tom murdock (tom at thinkingdistance.org) Friday,  31 January 2003, 05:14 AM:\n\nI'm also having some of these troubles with students. I don't know if it is Norton yet or something else, but they get bounced and I haven't received clear enough info to pass along yet...\n\nThus, hence, therefore, I agree with James that a little more flexibility as a teacher might give us a chance to compensate for their lack of computer skills...\n\nFrom Sean Keogh (s.keogh at oxilp.ac.uk) Friday,  31 January 2003, 11:00 PM:\n\nThere is the possibility of a similar situation here.  In the so-called real world, students have a deadline for submission of assessments.  They have to post them into the asessment box in the library, usually by 11AM on the day of the dealine.  The box is then wheeled away to the office, the submissions emptied out, sorted, and delivered to the relevant teachers.  If a student misses the dealine then that's it, they don't get credit foir that assessment...unless they have a good reason (seriousd illness, their train was derailed, a meteorite struck their desk, etc).\n\n\n\nIn such cases they can request and fill in what's known as a concession form...if the excuse they put down is accepted, then they get to hand in their assessment after all.\n\n\n\nI can envision a similar thing happening here...if the student misses the assignment deadline, but convinces the powers that be that they have a valid excuse, then they mail it to their group tutor (who might not be the one that set the assignment), who submits it for them.  It is then graded and given feedback as normal.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  31 January 2003, 11:30 PM:\n\nJust a comment on that last point, Sean, they can also submit the assignment late on the Moodle interface.\n\n\n\nBut I agree with the basic thrust of all the above in that the teacher should be able to easily fix up the database to cover for external failures. :-)  \n\n\n\nPerhaps just adding a really quick login-as feature from any page would do the trick.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  31 January 2003, 11:35 PM:\n\nJames, your mail box is over quota again ...\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Tuesday, 4 February 2003, 01:00 PM:\n\nI notice also that a very time consuming aspect of assignments is downloading them, grading them, and then trying to get the product back to the student.\n\n\n\nI think maybe if there were a teacher submission possible in response to the student submission it would kill two birds with one stone.\n\n\n\nFor example, I assign some writing, the studetn uploads it (invariably in word), I download it and edit the file with comments... then I have to reproduce the comments in feedback.. and mail the corrected file back via email.\n\n\n\nNow I have an edited file sitting on a local file system, yuck.  What to do with it?  Mailing off to student doesn't leave me a copy.  I'm at a public library or on a public terminal at a hot tub in Maui... if only there was a way to dump it back to moodle.. \n\n\n\nSo if I get ambitious I'll look at the file resources and see if a pop-up to add the file to the local files system then associate it with the student's assignment record works.  I think the code in the resources could be useful as it differentiates local files from uploaded web pages, and URLs..\n\n\n\nnow, back to my Maui vacation daydreaming...\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday, 4 February 2003, 01:48 PM:\n\nSee MDL-161 about this.\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Tuesday, 4 February 2003, 02:28 PM:\n\nUnderstood.  I'll try to take a crack at it.",

There will be more ;-)\n\n\n\nIt would be nice to have the ability to define sub-levels within weekly or numbered course modules...so that there might be a course module labelled Week 1 say, with three sections in it, named, for example, 1-DRAFTING, 2-TAX and 3-CONVEYANCING...\n\n\n\nEach of these would then contain resources and potentially activities on that subject.\n\n\n\nSo week 1.1.3 might be an example draft contract, week 1.3.2 might be a quiz on aspects of land searches...and in the next week there might be something like week 2.2.1, which is a set of further reading links in whatever subject 2.2 is for that week.\n\n\n\nDo you see what I mean?  The numbers don't matter, and I only used them to illustrate the concept.  I also don't expect the numbers to mean the same thing each week (or in each numbered module, if you are not using weeks)...because the first week might have three separate subjects covered, while the second week might only cover one subject, but might wish to split it up in sub-sections to aid clarity.",

      "04/Mar/03 1:39 PM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Friday, 7 February 2003, 11:27 AM:\n\nI concur this would be a useful feature.\n\n\n\nHowever, I've been addressing the need by using separate forums.  Within the forums I post reading assigments as attachments where I think the number of sources require more organization, or I don't think they belong on the top week entry as a resource.\n\n\n\nSo for example in week 3 of my Information Law course I would have a tort law, contract law, and property law forum defined with reading assigments posted within the forums.  It's useful as there is always a forum thread associated iwth each reading assignement and I can use that to spur the question/comment postings.\n\n\n\nRelying on attachments to forum posts could introduce interesting copyright problems, however.  Note I am not providing legal advice, and comment only on the general applications of copyright law.  I am only licensed to practice law in the District of Columbia.\n\n\n\nAs a resource you can define URL's to content on the net by linking.   There is some discussion in U.S. courts of linking issues which cna provide soem guidance.\n\n\n\nHowever, if you want to post to a forum, you have to have an attachment... as currently implemented.  Downloading content, saving it locally, uploading it to the moodle forum, and possibly redistributing it via the posting then could require a more sensitive analysis.  \n\n\n\nNote assertion of fair use (or juridictional equivelent) in response to U.S. Copyright infringement claims can be problematic, and is generally urged only as a last resort for copyright defendants.\n\n\n\nI would suggest we think about adding some more features to the postings, such as replacing the attachment calls with calls to resource.  \n\n\n\nIs that code located in lib.php?\n\n\n\ncents(cents(my))\n\nFrom P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Tuesday, 4 March 2003, 05:39 AM:\n\nI like Sean's idea. Maybe the way to go would be to introduce a kind of container resource that Zbigniew mentions at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=804 This type of resource could be called e.g. Heading and it would not hold any content itself. Instead, it would hold other resources (including next-level headings), each of which would be indented a little to show which heading they belong to.\n\n\n\nTaking this idea a little further, maybe allow for expanding/collapsing of those headings?",

    "Description": "Here's yet another thought from the beardie idea factory.  Wasn't included in my mail the other day as it has just occurred to me.\n\n\n\nSomething that would petentially be useful in some courses would be the ability to set a pre-requisite for a course module.  Let me illustrate.\n\n\n\nSay you have a course with five modules, numbered 1 to 5\n\n\n\nThe first module is the introductory section...fine...second module gets into the meat of the first part of the course and finishes with a quiz.  In order to gain access to the third module, the student has to get 70% or better in the final quiz in module 2.\n\n\n\nThe student gives it three attempts (which are of course tracked and the teacher may have already noticed this and stepped in to help) and the student eventually gets 75%.  This is enough to qualify...so his account gains a badge or token...as discussed in another bug entry the other day.  This badge says (effectively) course soandso module 2 pass.\n\n\n\nNow module three has a prerequisite on it which says that participants must have that token or badge on their account to gain entry.  This student now has it, so he gets to move on to the next bit of the course.  Meanwhile, students who are not understanding the concepts in module 2 are prevented from progressing and getting lost in later things, before they have a decent grounding in the earlier stuff.\n\n\n\nA quick check by teaching staff will show those that have not yet gained the module 2 pass token, so they know instantly who is having problems.\n\n\n\nI know that it might be possible to do some of this by having a separate course for each module, with an enrolment key, and only issuing the next key to the student when they pass the quiz, but this would involve a lot more manual intervention by teaching staff that should be *teaching*...working with students, rather than dealing with fiddly admin stuff.  Also, how long would the enrolment key last?...by the time three people had passed the quiz, nearly all of the students would have the key...I know what students are like.\n\n\n\nThis is a pretty complex area of course...I don't even know if you agree with the basic concept, but having had a fair few years in this business (been in IT since 1984) dealing with user assessments and several years at OILP dealing with students, I know it would be a helpful facility for *some* subjects.",

Is the whole quiz invalid?\n\nFrom   (uniksboy at my.msuiit.edu.ph) Friday, 7 February 2003, 01:48 PM:\n\nYes, the quiz must be restarted. After a certain threshold (for restarts) is reached, the student is considered failed. We're using moodle in the undergraduate and soon in the graduate level. Many of our faculty members, including me, requested for this feature so as to prevent students from browsing their notes/books while answering the online quiz. The CISCO academy has this in their quiz module.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday, 7 February 2003, 02:00 PM:\n\nThis is a dangerous path, I think.\n\n\n\nWhy would you want to prevent students using the information available to them?\n\n\n\nThe problem with this approach is that teachers eventually get the false sense of security that they are downloading information into students which is being uploaded back into quizzes, and that the quizzes are providing an accurate means of assessment of what has remained in the student.  This old-fashioned approach is easy on teachers, but has been shown in a lot of current research to be ineffective for actual student learning.\n\n\n\nIf you instead use the quiz as a learning activity (allowing research, plenty of time etc) then student can learn just by doing it.   Despite their wide use for assessment, quizzes are not a very good way to assess what a student has REALLY learned.\n\n\n\nPersonally I would not be very interested in adding this sort of feature to the quiz module (though of course someone else can if they want to!)\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 7 May 2005, 01:21 AM:\n\nI guess that now with the existence of timed quizzes and of random shuffling of questions this feature request can be considered sufficiently satisfied.",

There are two options that are currently available in Moodle. \n\n1. For some question types (e.g. multiple choice), you can edit the question to award 100% for all answers, which meets this need. (Or you can do more flexible things.)\n\n2. Or, on the quiz editing page, you can change the weight for this question.

It would be nice if for example, the total points would be 0 so that it doesn't hurt anyone but the student can get 5 and it would help his grade.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday, 7 February 2003, 01:44 PM:\n\nIf you set the offline assignment to 20, say, as a maximum extra grade, then all that happens is that there is another column in the grades with the extra marks.  Students who get the default 0 grade will not be penalized ... \n\n\n\nFor example, a student who got a perfect score on all their assignments (eg 25/25/50), but nothing on the extra credit assignment, would get 100.  A student who did the same, but ALSO got a perfect score on the extra assignment would get 120.\n\n\n\nYes?\n\nFrom Peter Thourson (peter at thourson.com) Friday, 7 February 2003, 01:53 PM:\n\nHowever, in the student sector, it reports that the student has gotten a 100 out of a possible 120. When calculating percentages, it makes it more difficult because you have to subtract the extra 20 points.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday, 7 February 2003, 02:07 PM:\n\nAh, OK, fair enough.  Well then perhaps there needs to be a feature in the modules to enable/disable the adding of their grades to the total.\n\n\n\nSomething like:\n\n\n\n[X] Include this grade in the course total grade?\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Peter Thourson (peter at thourson.com) Friday, 7 February 2003, 02:13 PM:\n\nIt is not possible it possible for the teacher to give more points than the points possible for everything? For example, I am able to setup the quizzes to give 13/10 points...\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Saturday, 8 February 2003, 01:15 PM:\n\nI think this relates to a concern I have about how to inflate grades, and a recent magic bucket of points bug.\n\n\n\nPehaps implmeneted using a kind of assignment that is ignored by the current grading methods, but kicks in on a conditional somewhere near the end of the grading totals?  Hard code a new assignment?  Not elegant..\n\n\n\nMaybe the totals points are zero but has an additional attribute that allows a fixed point total?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  15 March 2006, 03:22 AM:\n\nThis was mis-classified.

      "04/Jun/06 11:46 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Wednesday,  19 March 2003, 01:11 AM:\n\nThis issue has been a real problem this semester.  I had one student, in particular, get off schedule and I wanted to let the person take the quizzes.  Unfortunately when I reopen them the review feature can't work because the quiz is open.  Also there's possibility of people popping in and taking the quiz without permission.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  20 March 2003, 03:11 PM:\n\nYou can delete the appropriate line from the quiz_attempts table.  Find the attempt in the report, and look at the URL for it, eg \n\n\n\nhttp://server.dougiamas.net/moodle/mod/quiz/report.php?q=1&attempt=35\n\n\n\nSo the attempt ID is 35 in this case.\n\n\n\nThen go into Manage Database, look at quiz_attempts, and delete the line with ID=35.  That should do it.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 5 February 2005, 08:36 PM:\n\nIf I understand correctly you need to be able to let individual students to retake the quiz AFTER the due date. We also need this feature here in York. I can't think of an easy way to implement this but because it would be really useful I will think more about it.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Tuesday, 4 April 2006, 05:36 AM:\n\nI would like to see an easy way to reopen a quiz for a student, rather than just delete an attempt and make a new attempt. I have a student that misunderstood the instructions and I want to give him a chance to try it again.",

Module is available when MENU1, MENU2 ..\n\n\n\nMENU = xxmodulexx is completed\n\n       date is xxxx, etc\n\n\n\n2. Module is completed when MENU\n\n\n\nMENU = grade higher than passing grade,\n\n       date is xxxx, etc\n\n\n\nAlso, what happens if am activity in the chain is altered?

    "Description": "I've had a request from some of the teachers here that I have demonstrating moodle to.\n\n\n\nThey want to know if the following could be added:\n\n\n\nA way to press a button and be given a summary for any given quiz, showing the percentage of each question that has been answered correctly in all the attempts so far, and the percentage wrong (and I suppose by extension, if you have a question with multiple answers, each of which gains a mark, the percentage for each that was got all correct, or only part correct, if you see what I mean).\n\n\n\nThe reason for this request is so that, in a course in which there are potentially over three hundred students, it becomes possible to see, at a glance, which questions are being found particularly difficult by the student body as a whole.  Otherwise the staff would have to go into *each attempt* by *each student* and somehow build up manually a statistical analysis of the results.\n\n\n\nThis isn't a replacement for teachers looking at students' individual results...they will still do that, and check up on students that seem to be getting poor results on multiple attempts at quizzes, but it gives a useful way of gauging whether or not the quiz is being aimed in the right area, or if there is some deficiency in the teaching that needs to be corrected.\n\n\n\nI guess there might be some way for me to hack together something by pulling the results data for each attempt out into a spreadsheet, but first I need to work out how each attempt's results are stored.",

      "09/Sep/05 4:08 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Thursday,  13 March 2003, 01:57 AM:\n\nHi Martin And Pat . I read your conversation and try just summarize needs:\n\n1. Way to limit who can add/delete/modify/etc item (course/coursemodules/moduleitems)\n\n2. ACL should work on  user and group level\n\n3. Way to map created acl-rule to specific item and one item only.\n\n3. Way to grant wanted rights when certain criterias are meet. (Course/module is completed with specifig grade etc.. )\n\n4. Timelimit access\n\n5. Specify default access for item\n\n\n\nHere's my first tougths:\n\n\n\nHow about if we split fuctionality two separate parts?\n\n  -One for write/read/modify acls?\n\n  -And other for testing criterias?( to see when specific situation is true)\n\n    -this part could then write/remove needed acl's and there's no need to check criterias if access is already cranted.\n\n    -this part could be event driven. Example: When course is completed, course calls function, what search all criterias that depends on event course_completed. If found rules are complex and they contain more than one element, we could write this partical value down. (see tables)\n\n    -Theres already activity logging on moodle, so maybe we could extend it to send events.\n\n\n\nSepartion could help to keep things clean and fast. I see need for complex rules for acl-creation/deletion, but it'll propably slow performance down if we do it everytime when page is accessed.\n\n\n\nACL items could be stored in one table. Table could be quite  simple like\n\nid (key), itemid(string?,indexed),userid(int),groupid(int),right(int, bitmapped)\n\n\n\nBut those criteria rules will need two tables.\n\nTable criteria\n\n         id(key), //just identify records\n\n         itemid, //where this criteria is linked to\n\n         when_true(string) //code what to run when rule turn from false to true\n\n         when_false(string) //code what to run when rule turn from true to false\n\ntable criteria_rules\n\n        id(key), //just to identify records\n\n        critid(int) //linked to table criteria->id\n\n        monitored_valuename //cousenro, time, date course_completed\n\n        operator // eq, lt, gt , ne etc...\n\n        value  //compare\n\n        status //status of this rule (true or false)\n\n\n\nUuups, this getting longer and longer and more complex, but isn't it just fun?\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nPetri\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  14 March 2003, 11:24 AM:\n\nI haven't read this deeply yet but I think it's on the right track.  \n\n\n\nIt's important that the final solution be easy to understand and relatively simple to implement.\n\n\n\nAnother factor that might need to be included is the Access control of user files: <A HREF=http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=862>Discussion on user files</A>\n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Sunday,  16 March 2003, 01:23 AM:\n\nWe will need more than that event-system, because it will detect only future events no current status. Maybe module could run some checks when it's adding criteria for acl-creating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  21 November 2003, 02:55 PM:\n\nMy current thinking on this is to call it a Roles system.\n\n\n\nEvery different functionality in the system is identified and protected with a function like isteacher and isadmin do now, but many more of them, like isforumpost and isjournaledit.\n\n\n\nThe admin has a GUI to set up roles.  It is simply a long list of all the known functions in Moodle, with checkboxes.  They can give a name to this combination (eg Parent, Guest, or Tutor) and save it as a role.\n\n\n\nEach student or teacher is then assigned one role per class.  I'm not sure how the GUI would look for this, but this system should be pretty easy to understand and manage, while keeping database complexity to a minimum.\n\n\n\nThe current Role of a user is then used to determine the response of all the isxxxxxxx functions.\n\nFrom Mike Churchward (mike at churchward.ca) Friday,  28 November 2003, 02:36 AM:\n\nXaraya has a great role/privilege system. Both are hierarchical.\n\n\n\nPrivileges can be defined and be members of other privileges. The module(s) they apply to can be assigned, and the level (read, comment, moderate, etc.) can be assigned.\n\n\n\nRoles consist of groups and users. Groups can be members of other groups, and users can be members of groups. Privileges can be assigned to groups and inherited down the hierarchy.\n\n\n\nIts a good design with a good interface. I see such a system as something that would really add to Moodle (at least for me).\n\n\n\nmike\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Wednesday,  25 May 2005, 07:07 PM:\n\nI see that having site-defined roles in Moodle is a quite an old issue but nothing has visibly happened. What has been discussed here is a fine plan but may be in the first implementation it should not be so fine grained as proposed. More important would be to implement this sooner than version 2. As Moodle is becoming an enterprise tool, having only admin that can do all and course creator (who can't even edit existing courses) becomes deficient. We are only a department-level Moodle but could use a few extra admin roles, like admin that can be restricted to specific course category or forbidden to deal with users, or course manager that not only can create courses (the current function is clearly for teachers to create courses for themselves) but also edit later courses he/she created.",

    "Description": "Wherever the rich-text editor is used, there could be a switch to turn it on or off on demand (when the user setting is plain text or editor, respectively).\n\n\n\nI personally find that the editor is needed in approx 5% of cases. Most of the time plain text messages are faster and effective enough. And the editor takes some time to load, which is not irrelevant for modem users. Therefore, it is better to disallow it in one's user setting. But then, in those 5% of cases you have to go to your profile to turn it on. I usually don't bother and simply use html code. But what about those who don't know html?",

    "Description": "Assignments and Quizzes allow for points to be alloted from 1-100.  I have a variety of assignments and quizzes that have different weights against the final grade.   Having the 1-100 score without a weighting coefficient means I end up doing things like =sum(c$:d$)*1.6667 in the excel exports to actually get the right distributions for grades.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (which I'm considering again) is yes fix the max points to the appropriate final grade distribution.  I had avoided that because giving the student a 67 our of 84 points seems more troublesome than just leaving things as a max 100 scale.  It turned out to be a pain in the arse for grading this time around, as I had alot of differently weighted assignments.\n\n\n\nI'm going to look at the moodle/course/grade{s}.php and see how a weighted distribution could be hacked on those pages.\n\n\n\nI think I'd discussed this in a different bug but generally a field in the quiz and assignment tables for final weight would be handy.\n\n\n\nThoughts?",

Although to be fair we could probably put in a print stylesheet to eliminate wasted space - I just don't have the time at the moment.\n\nIf you want to be able to print a test so that students can answer it on paper, well that is something different, and I am not convinced that Moodle is the best tool for the job, but the HTML export format is intended for this - although I don't think much work has been invested in it recently, so it could probably be improved.\n\nIf you want to print all the questions, with marking details and feedback, for checking, then that is yet a third thing.\n\nAs I see it, this bug is about the first of these three things - making some changes to the print stylesheet so that people who insist on printing the review page of their attempt do not have to kill more trees that are absolutely necessary to do so.\n\nIf you are proposing something else, please file other bugs with a clear description of your requirements, but I would encourage you to discuss this in the quiz forum first, http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?f=121, and it may be better to flesh out the requirements on the wiki at http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Developer_notes#Quiz_.26_question_types",

Reasons as follows:\n\nMany of our instructors invest a lot of time building their quizzes in Moodle.  They need a printed copy to bring in the event that there are network/computer problems where the quiz would then have to be taken manually.   They also print out their exams, with the results, so they can more-easily proof their work when they are done building the exam, and they also like to print students' results from time to time.\n\nCurrently, we save the quiz as RTF from the browser and edit the RFT file to condense it and make it look \"pretty\".

If only there was a way to remove the \"Quiz Navigation\", and settings block? This way when previewing the Quiz, the questions display without the Left or right column Sidebars expanding across the entire page which would be a printer friendly view. \n\nIf this was possible I think it would suffice for most faculty who want to have backup hard copies to give to students who have computer problems while attempting a quiz. All of our students use their own personal PC/MAC laptops on our wireless network with The Respondus LDB Plug-in to write their Midterms and Finals. Frequently in a class of 100+ students writing a quiz on their LT there will be one or two students who have Mal ware or hardware problems on their PC/MAC requiring the faculty member to just hand them a hard copy to write their exam.\n \nWe switched from Angel 7.4 to Moodle three years ago due to them being bought out by Blackboard. Angel had the Assessment printing option of a quiz from Day one dating back to 2006. You simply clicked a \"Print\" icon while previewing a quiz and it printed out perfectly.\n\nWe've been very happy with Remote Learner and the Moodle LMS system except for this one thorn in our side of not being able to easily print out a hard copy of a quiz. We've had to ask faculty to create a separate  MS Word version of the same quiz they created in their Moodle course if they plan on handing out any hard copies. Our IT department frequently gets asked from Moodle instructors why can't they just print out a hard copy directly from the course like they used to in Angel? It amazes me that this Moodle Feature Request has been open for 10 and a half years with still no solution in sight. \n\n\n-CF",

So someone else will have to get their hands dirty as it were.\n\nI'd like to suggest a quick and nasty first step: a display of all the quiz items in a on one page, in a compact form, with a little space for essays, no navigation shown, some compactness in the result.

It would be even more difficult for users. We have to think about some users who are not computer savvy. That's why this approach would not work for me.\r\n\r\nIf someone could just point me where to change this in the code, I could implement the changes and provide the code to be included in future versions.\r\n\r\nAll the best,",

Our users want to be able to print their quizzes, so they can go back online once and just copy their answers.\r\n\r\nIt's something much simpler than what the University of Vienna has done. It's just a print-friendly option, without pagination, website layout, question block numbers. I'm a Joomla developer and in Joomla (for instance) I can just add the &tmpl=component to the query string and it displays just the component/content area without all modules and website layout. In Joomla that works for any component. In Joomla it's useful to display components in modal windows and for print-friendly pages.\r\n\r\nBest regards,",

I will follow a fairly minimalist approach which will satisfy typical requirements, but not all:\r\n\r\n* Quiz pages (attempts and reviews) should appear on the printer as a faithful representation of what is on the screen. However, elements that are not relevant to printing (such as headers, footers, navigation blocks, submit buttons, edit buttons) should be removed in print.\r\n* As Tim remarked, this is best achieved via CSS formatting.\r\n* Print output should be available to teachers and students alike, at all stages of the quiz (e.g., with answered filled in or not).\r\n* I will make no attempt to alter the content of quiz pages as such. Teachers who want all questions printed on one page should format the quiz so that it displays all questions on one page (or use the quiz review for printing instead).\r\n* Options such as font scaling, paper size, custom headers and footers and export options are left to the browser's print feature; many browsers allow \"printing to a PDF file\" for example.\r\n\r\nA patch will follow shortly.",

The patch adds no extra elements to the quiz pages, not even a \"print\" button. The user should use the browser's built-in print button instead.\r\n\r\nThe patch hides all navigation bars and blocks, headers and footers, except for the breadcrumb (which may be useful for identifying which quiz was printed).\r\n\r\nApart from formal peer review, it would be good if others could test the patch where possible, and report experiences on different browsers, themes, etc.",

I teach people who are very new to computers and the Internet and they have a lot of fear. Mine are online courses but we have one f2f meeting at the beginning during which I make sure they understand how the online course works. I'm worried they'll be too  intimidated to go and register before class. They can't register in class because they are too new to access their email away from home (they don't know how to configure email software locally, they forgot their email address and it's written down at home, etc). This might be too flaky a request to make. I'm planning to go right in the database and flag their new user accounts as confirmed if they arrive unenrolled.\n\n \n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Monday,  21 April 2003, 03:40 PM:\n\nedmiston: As I see it,your needs are not related this bug. But, If you setup external authentication database (LDAP, I prefer) users can login without confirmation database. Or.. Does it help, if you give basic diagram picture of account creation/confirmation?\n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Monday,  21 April 2003, 03:46 PM:\n\nOne more way to enrollment:\n\n6. External enrolment,\n\n   -authentication modules could be updated fuctions like  auth_get_userlist what will return information that does not exist Moodle-database.\n\n   - If external-user is selected, account is created to Moodle on fly, and user is enrolled to course.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  21 April 2003, 04:04 PM:\n\nI think it makes sense to keep enrolment as a completely separate system to authentication.  I can see a directory enrol parallel to the auth folder, containing all the enrol modules (one of which would function just like Moodle does now).\n\n\n\nThere could also be an LDAP module, and a PayPal module etc.\n\n\n\nBasically, the hooks to these would need to be in:\n\n\n\n1) require_login() function, which would do the\n\nexternal check the first time, then set/use an enrolled[course] flag in the session after that (for speed).\n\n\n\n2) http://moodle.cvs.sourceforge.net/moodle/moodle/course/enrol.php , which would need to be changed to do whatever GUI the enrolment module might require.\n\n\n\nMatt Hope might be working on this ... \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday, 5 August 2003, 11:38 AM:\n\nI'm going to be working on this full modular system after 1.1\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  14 March 2004, 01:30 AM:\n\nStill coming ...\n\nFrom Christian Lebe (christian at moodle.com) Tuesday,  18 April 2006, 01:09 PM:\n\nI think all the features mentioned have been completed.

And I noticed a funny thing .... there's weren't any hyperlinks on the page. I mean I couldn't see any. I started brooding about hyperlinks. My moodle site is the first time I've ever made a site where I didn't underline the links. Looking at the print of the forum I started to worry about my site. I tell my students they will eventually come to terms with their printers at some point. In the meantime I try to note which pages I recommend they print and they can not worry about printing everything. Me, I print too much probably. I tend to print long stuff so I can carry it outside to read it. \n\n\n\nI like to see hyperlinks underlined on a printed page and I like them to be visually differentiated from the text on the glowscreen, so I always underlined them in addition to color. I like to know what's available. But at the same time I teach my web students to strive toward gracefully incorporating descriptive, meaningful, link text into the pages they create so that the page reads in a natural way. I don't like to see pages that make you think about the technology. I like the technology, don't get me wrong. But it has its place and its place is behind the words.\n\n\n\nSo looking at the printout of this forum I got this sinking feeling as I imagined my students dutifully printing like crazy and then looking at pages with no indication at all of the resources embedded in it. That's a little too subtle for me.\n\n\n\nMaybe the answer is ... when developing the printer-version of a page the style could be changed to underline links? With all these students out there crafting masterful link text that merges seamlessly into the narrative, how will people looking at a printed page recognize the jewels in the crown?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom paula edmiston (edmiston at matrixmagic.com) Sunday,  20 April 2003, 04:13 AM:\n\nSorry ... I meant to say ... 1) can we have printer views of all resources, activities, etc, in addition to forums AND 2)can the printer view have the underline style on both visited and unvisited links.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Sunday,  21 March 2004, 08:32 AM:\n\nOld bug.

I recently read a forum post in which another person said this would be nice too. So I thought I'd offer my solution. I hope the code isn't too crummy (I'm awfully new to php and mysql). Maybe you will like the idea and have better code than mine!!! Maybe this could be an on/off option in the site settings, to give people a choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadding username at the top that is a link to log out.\n\nplaces the name centered under logo on home page and everywhere there was a top of page logout link on other pages. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdited two files (theme/mm is my personal theme)\n\n\n\n1. display the user name on the home page, centered just under the logo\n\n\n\nedit theme/mm/header.html\n\nat about line 17, just under the line that calls the logo (in the standardlogo theme) I inserted this:\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--  paula added display of user name on home page, centered   \n\n      under the logo; the name is a logout link - the link title \n\n      displays the label logout when hovered \n\n      insert new code on next line -->\n\n \n\n<br><center><font size=1><a href=login/logout.php title=Logout><? echo $USER->firstname $USER->lastname; ?></a></font></center>\n\n\n\n<!-- stop paula -->\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Then be able select the topic(s) which would become \"sticky\" (fixed at the top of the list of topics).  Presumably, if more than one forum topic is selected as sticky, the teacher could fix the order of the sticky topics (first, second, third...).\n\nOn the data capture feature, that is another great idea.  It needs to be automated or semi-automated, though.  With a teacher clicking on a \"capture data\" button, she/he could select (copy to wiki, copy to glossary, copy to database) and the data would be moved into a pre-existing or new wiki/glossary/database. \n",

      "22/Mar/12 3:23 PM;712020:ac10d74e-303d-4704-b1ec-b5a72f1d71f7;Thanks, Stuart, for reviving this *urgently* needed new feature. Yes, sticky forums/pinned topics have been batted around for ages, even before 2006 when this issue was first listed. I think it deserves a push again, because the core of Moodle has always been the forum,and Moodle has the best forums of any LMS. I am really proud of that and it is actually the reason I chose Moodle in 2003.\n\nThe reason we need pinned topics for an admin/teacher is because it aids in knowledge creation. Forums often suffer from an meandering, petering-out syndrome. That is OK in some cases, but sometimes the topic is so critical, that periodic summarizing and focusing can help, and literally *create* structured knowledge. I see two workflows in such a teaching scenario--one top down, one bottom up.\n- Top-down pinned topic/sticky forum: the teacher or discussion moderator selects a main topic and pins it so it stays at the top of the list, and visually appears slightly emphasized (color or shading). As posts are added, the moderator grabs relevant content and summarizes what the group is learning from each other.\n- Bottom-up pinned topic/sticky forum: Any forum that starts out in a normal, serial pattern, can be switched to a pinned topic mode. A person or persons can be selected or volunteer to summarize the discussion and keep that summary at the top of the discussion. Also, within a large forum, multiple pinned topics can be selected to rise to the top, either by moderator-choice or participant-voting. And of course, a pinned topic could serve as a directory within a large forum, where the key topics can be listed and visitors pointed towards them. \n\nAnother reason we need pinned topics is because knowledge creation is extending beyond a single semester-single co-hort model. As we create learning communities that exist with ongoing purposes beyond merely granting credits for passing a course, we need to keep forums active and growing for many years, even after students graduate. Ways to capture the knowledge can include wiki, but a pinned topic is more organic, and can flow from the discussion. Moodle.org would greatly benefit from this, and give more specific roles for volunteers to help moderate some forums.",

      "10/Dec/15 6:38 PM;70121:8751f8b3-baef-4a5d-93a7-2d1586aba214;Hey Ben,\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for working on this issue, it looks like it's been a long requested feature and is definitely a tricky one to implement. Overall I think your patch looks pretty great and is very comprehensive. After looking over your change I've just got a few points for you to consider (sorry if the list is long, it's a large patch, haha):\r\n\r\n# Should the 'mod/forum:pindiscussions' capability be of type “write” since it allows you to modify the forum post data?\r\n# I’m not 100% convinced by [this|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...BenKelada:MDL-372-master#diff-968b624e975ad3df52446c206926d60aR2576] change which automatically prefixes “d.pinned DESC” to all custom sorting requests. It means you can never use that API to retrieve discussions in the order you choose, making it fairly inflexible. I think it would be good to have the default ordering using the pinned column but I’m not so sure about making it mandatory on all custom sorting as well. There may be some cases where you might not want pinned discussions to take priority (maybe in a blog style forum?). As a side note, I suspect this is also going to cause problems when this function is called with $sort being the value returned from forum_get_default_sort_order(), such as what forum_print_latest_discussions() does, where the SQL statement will end up with 2 “d.pinned DESC” commands in the ORDER BY clause (one from forum_get_default_sort_order() and one from the hardcoded prefix in this line). I’m not sure if that will cause an issue with some databases.\r\n# Again adding some mandatory ordering with [this|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...BenKelada:MDL-372-master#diff-968b624e975ad3df52446c206926d60aR2602] change, which may not be generally applicable. If you wanted to add that change I think it should ideally be in the forum_get_default_sort_order() so that it isn’t mandatory (inline with my point above). If you did want to make it mandatory I think adding it to [this|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...BenKelada:MDL-372-master#diff-968b624e975ad3df52446c206926d60aR2576] line would be the best place, since that’s where the other mandatory sorting has been hardcoded in.\r\n# You’ve made a lot of changes to forum_get_discussion_neighbours() which I’m a little bit weary of because of how crazy complex that function is, haha. Some things I’ve notice with your changes to it:\r\n## You’re now doing a join with for forum_posts table in all cases, when it isn’t used by anything other than the blog forums. That’s going to slow the query down unnecessarily. It would probably be best to only do the join when it’s required.\r\n## In [this|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...BenKelada:MDL-372-master#diff-968b624e975ad3df52446c206926d60aR2740] and [this|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...BenKelada:MDL-372-master#diff-968b624e975ad3df52446c206926d60aR2745] line you’re sorting by id but haven’t included the table prefix, it should probably be d.id? Also for the $nextsql should it be “id ASC” instead of “id DESC”?\r\n## On those 2 lines above you’re also doing a boolean expression in the order by clause (d.pinned = :pinnedstate3), does that work across multiple databases? The other option is to use the case statement to achieve the same thing (CASE WHEN d.pinned = :pinnedstate3 THEN 1 ELSE 0) which we know is compatible (since we’re already using one).\r\n## You’ve added in sorting by id which was explicitly ignored by the first implementation of this function. I think it’s actually safe in this case because you’re only using it as a fall back on identical timestamped discussions. I’m more pointing this out for Andrew’s benefit to have a think about.\r\n# Please update the testing instructions\r\n## Mention the need to test on multiple databases (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle etc)\r\n## Add more testing instructions to cover some complex scenarios having different combinations of pinned, time delayed (e.g. starting in the future) and normal posts forums posts.\r\n## Add some testing instructions for different types of forums (regular, blog etc)\r\n## Add a scenario to cover backup / restore of a course with pinned discussions\r\n# Thanks a lot for updating the unit tests with new scenarios covering the pinned discussions. It would be really great to add some behat tests to cover off the front end for pinning discussions, making sure the button is visible, the issue rises to the top etc.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to ping [~accountid:5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b] to have a quick look over this when he's got a spare second because he knows everything there is to know about all things and is especially well versed in the Moodle forum code.",
      "10/Dec/15 10:11 PM;712020:777ae5ba-ad3b-47ba-8991-b008436ad1cd;Thanks for reviewing Ryan!\r\n1) yes should be write, will patch that\r\n2) -the sorting ignoring pinned is gets a bit tricky, maybe i could add a parameter to the forum_get_discussions $sortpinned = 1 , - updated this\r\n3) the forced sort by id is really just a catch all to make sure ordering is consistent for whatever sort order is chosen , removed the other hard coded sort\r\n4) i) i thought it would be a little simpler(?!) having the one query, it should really be a full join, and its only on the discussion->1 post, so it shouldnt be a performance issue as a full join. I can also split the query and make it blog only if required,\r\nii) will fix, I intentionally left them both DESC, to force a consistent order, changed as it is less confusing\r\niii) not sure? should i change it just in case?\r\niv) yeah thats what i figured, it only forces an order when time modified is the same\r\n\r\n5) can do.\r\n\r\n6) if anyone can assist with the behat tests that would be great, i need to setup my environment again, and wont have time for a bit\r\n\r\nWill update the fixes in a few days, if not shorter, would be good to hear andrews thoughts too\r\ncheers,\r\nBen",

I've been following it in the background for a few weeks now.\r\n\r\nThere are a few minor issues which need to be resolved before this can be integrated:\r\n# https://github.com/ryanwyllie/moodle/compare/e65dfd9...ba697260dab96ec01de77d2c9bc6419c0b5201a8#diff-93d5236b32d211736b4a0ac4cafb7028: The version number was not updated, which suggests that this entry was hand-written.

It's not a major overhead, but it's completely avoidable. The best option would be to simply unset($fromform->pinned); here, and stop depending upon it in forum_update_discussion() - e.g. add an isset test there.\r\n# https://github.com/ryanwyllie/moodle/compare/e65dfd9...ba697260dab96ec01de77d2c9bc6419c0b5201a8#diff-b214ea402c9798e063064078588f93d3R875 - two lines of whitespace\r\n# https://github.com/ryanwyllie/moodle/compare/e65dfd9...ba697260dab96ec01de77d2c9bc6419c0b5201a8#diff-e25e90247fb19916c11517d9315bc713 - not sure what this behat change has to do with this issue\r\n# https://github.com/ryanwyllie/moodle/compare/e65dfd9...ba697260dab96ec01de77d2c9bc6419c0b5201a8#diff-bf08c1a576812f8fe4a810a5a2c20cc7 - ditto this one\r\n# https://github.com/ryanwyllie/moodle/compare/e65dfd9...ba697260dab96ec01de77d2c9bc6419c0b5201a8#diff-c6df38863603a665ae4ebeb093e0a77d and https://github.com/ryanwyllie/moodle/compare/e65dfd9...ba697260dab96ec01de77d2c9bc6419c0b5201a8#diff-e5919cdd8daf11c35af73d4f004b22a9 should use the FORUM_DISCUSSION_PINNED and friend constants\r\n# https://github.com/ryanwyllie/moodle/compare/e65dfd9...ba697260dab96ec01de77d2c9bc6419c0b5201a8#diff-968b624e975ad3df52446c206926d60aR4396 - I'm not necessarily so keen on this change. This value is used for timemodified, and I don't think that we should encourage overriding of the time modified in this fashion. That said, it is only a minor concern. Can I ask why this change was made?\r\n\r\nAs I say, these are all minors issues and it should be pretty quick to resolve them.\r\n\r\nIf you're unable to get to them before tomorrow morning, could you please ping Ryan so that he may update the issue and we can get this issue integrated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAndrew",

A quote feature for users who have disabled the rich-text-editor in the user profile (this includes the Plain Text, Markdown, Moodle Auto-Format formats) would be fundamentally different and is not covered by our project scope at the moment.\r\n* Currently, Moodle ships with two rich-text editors: TinyMCE and Atto. We consider only Atto to be maintained in the long run and thus would like to focus on Atto.\r\n* Summing up, our approach would provide a nice quote feature for users using Atto (which is the default for new Moodle instances anyway) without impeding other users.\r\n\r\n* We propose to create a solution which will feel like modern email quoting as this is what user's expect from a quote feature.\r\n* We would probably create a combination of an Atto plugin and a modification of mod_forum:\r\n** The mod_forum modification will be needed to provide a \"Quote\" button besides the \"Reply\" button in the forum discussion and to paste the quoted post's content into the Atto editor on the following page. It would wrap the original message in a div with a class with suitable styling (e.g. left-hand border + padding). \r\n** The Atto plugin will have to handle the styling of the quote and the management of replies which are inserted into the quote like it's possible with every today's email client (handling cases like to split the div at the point when the 'enter' key was pressed, adding a non-styled section in between).\r\n* Based on that functionality, it would make sense if the Atto plugin can also be used detached from the use case at hand as a quote-styling button (especially as MDL-48905 and MDL-45662 to implement blockquotes in Atto seem not to come to an end).\r\n\r\n[~accountid:5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b]: As you were the last one to touch this ticket, could you please give me some feedback on our approach and our initial assumptions and evaluate the probability that it could be accepted for core when it's done?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex",

      "06/Sep/17 8:52 PM;5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b;Hi Alexandar,\r\n\r\nThis makes sense to me in theory.\r\n\r\nI would propose creating subtasks of this issue and splitting it into logical components:\r\n# add a way to \"reply with quote\" when replying to the post; and\r\n# changes to blockquote editing in atto.\r\n\r\nWith the reply with quote component, I have a few concerns, namely the fact that you can currently already reply to a forum post. I'm concerned with the prospect of adding an additional action to the post and how that would be presented. A couple of thoughts on potential solutions:\r\n# we make this a per-user preference\r\n** (/) no additional UI component within the forum UI\r\n** (x) we have too many such preferences\r\n** (x) this doesn't give enough granularity - it's either on or off for a user, and you can't choose it on a per-post option\r\n# we add a \"quote\" link or similar which performs the reply + quote action\r\n** (/) simple and hopefully clear\r\n** (x) UI clutter\r\n# we incorporate this change into an inline editor change\r\n** (/) puts everything into the same place\r\n** (/) keeps everything in context\r\n** (x) not really part of this request and would still need an option to include the reply but may provide different options for doing so\r\n\r\nI don't really have a suggestion for how to solve this, and I think we'd need to see some mockups and ideally to involve the UX team ([~accountid:70121:c9656886-f14e-41ea-a644-42f5e9822a23], [~accountid:70121:0b3e79d4-1b90-4573-b67e-6313412088a4]).\r\n\r\nWe should really use the standard HTML blockquote when creating the quoted text, so I don't know exactly what changes would be made in Atto and I think this is likely to be the area of most critique in this issue. You'd need to go into a bit more detail on how you'd anticipate this working, especially for those adding multi-line block quotes. I guess you're looking for something like Jira when dealing with markdown - e.g. if you are in a list, and press return, you continue in the last. If you press return again, it exits the list.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\n\r\nAndrew",
      "06/Sep/17 9:28 PM;557058:c1816d26-9b59-4fca-9dfd-09d5e132d03d;Another UX idea to throw into the brew: most good email clients do partial quotes based on the currently selected text. ie if you hit reply it's just normal, but if you selected a sentence or paragraph and then hit reply then you would get the quoted text in your reply. This work fantastically when you want fine grained responses.\r\n\r\nYou could either treat this as a bonus UI sugar on top of 1,2 or 3 above, OR you could make this the only way to access this feature. But that would mean some people may never discover the feature. To make it more discover-able if you select some text, then the reply button should swap from 'Reply' to 'Reply with quote' and you could also have a quote button along side the select text. Mockup below. One downside is that this would be harder to support on mobile, but doing any sort of extensive commenting is a pain on mobile anyway\r\n\r\n!image-2017-09-06-15-28-25-098.png!\r\n\r\n ",

Additionally, there is a new epic for a forum facelift on MDL-64547 which will be a better home for the review of Andreas' patch than this issue here.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at the discussions above, the items of this issue will be more or less be covered by MDL-64760. An exception is only [~accountid:557058:c1816d26-9b59-4fca-9dfd-09d5e132d03d]'s proposal to support part of the previous post.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is to target all discussion to MDL-64760 and to close this issue here as MDL-64760 is resolved.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlex",

      "13/Nov/04 2:25 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday, 6 May 2003, 11:10 AM:\n\nThe reason this hasn't been done already is the difficulty of how to treat resources which are uploaded files and external web pages.\n\n\n\nUsers don't know or care whether resources are in the database or separate files, so a user-friendly search needs to do all of them.  \n\n\n\nThe problem is how to search all these external resources in a quick, safe way.  Something like htdig to keep an index is one possibility.\n\nFrom paula edmiston (edmiston at matrixmagic.com) Tuesday, 6 May 2003, 11:39 AM:\n\nYikes! I went and read about htdig and it looks like it requires a lot of space for the index file (I have to pay by the MB at my commercial web host and already I have this giant index file for searching my site as a whole). The htdig.org site didn't mention the ability to index stuff like .doc files (I don't use much of that but I know folks who do)... This is tougher than I thought.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday, 6 May 2003, 11:42 AM:\n\nWhat are you using for your current search?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday, 6 May 2003, 11:46 AM:\n\nSeems to be quite a few possibilities here:\n\n\n\n<A HREF=http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Search_Engines/> http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Search_Engines/ </A>\n\n\n\nsuch as <A HREF=http://phpdig.toiletoine.net/> http://phpdig.toiletoine.net/ </A>\n\n\n\n...for someone with time to look into it!  :-)\n\nFrom paula edmiston (edmiston at matrixmagic.com) Wednesday, 7 May 2003, 12:01 AM:\n\nI use xav, the free version (http://www.xav.com/) and love its power. (the commercial version allows for separate and individual indexing of realms within a site.\n\n\n\nxav is a fast search, uses meta tags (description on the hit list and keywords for relevancy ranking). It can do boolean (after a fashion, with + and - but no parenthases), allows truncation (help* finds help, helpful, helping, etc) and allows me to enter a list of files and directories that should not be indexed. And I get a summary of searches that shows me what searches people are running on my site so I can tweak meta tags to ensure retrieval and provide content that is being looked for but I don't have. I have a cron job to rebuild the index every night (the misery is the index is running 4MB).\n\n\n\nAt a quick look I like phpdig - the size looks GREAT. I would like to look into more of this but have to away for a couple of weeks. I'll look at it some more when I return.",

I think there should be no problems with older browser, but in case, it should probably be possible to enable/disable styles on buttons all around the site.\n\n\n\n(One should probably create separate styles for dropdowns, checkboxes, radios and others as well.)\n\n\n\nStyle example: \n\n----------------------------\n\n.normal-btn {  font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 9px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #003366}\n\n----------------------------\n\n\n\nButton example\n\n----------------------------\n\n<INPUT TYPE=submit CLASS=normal-btn VALUE=Turn editing on>\n\n----------------------------\n\n\n\nIt should be fairly easy to search/replace the whole site also.\n\n\n\nRegds - ronhof",

Delete the copied record from log (or do a single delete query that deletes all records from log with an exact match in log_archive).\n\n\n\nAny page that lets you look at activity logs would have a button added that you could check to look at archived logs instead of current logs, or possibly to look at the current and archived logs.  If the site had been configured to delete rather than archive records, the option to view the archived records wouldn't show up.",

Moodle would still default to the most recent login, but sometimes, when I login to moodle for one immediate task (not having time to drift through recent activity), I log-off again and lose the chance to surf recent activity.

But they don't get the format selection box.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  10 May 2004, 03:04 PM:\n\nThe problem with the plain text option, Gustav, is that the editor puts HTML all through the message ... and a forum post, say, in plain text would suddenly show lots of HTML tags that the user hadn't typed.\n\n\n\nThis was happening a lot on moodle.org which is why the menu was removed in that case.\n\n\n\nBut Howard's original request is still valid. \n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  10 May 2004, 03:09 PM:\n\nI guess my request fits in with MDL-323.",

I would strongly vote for the option to select the type of text formatting be available in all contexts. We are running a fairly large Moodle installation, and one of the things we are trying to do is to get people to use good html when writing text documents. While we are pleased that Moodle is using the Markdown format, it is less than useful if instructors cannot use this format when writing directions for assignment, forum, etc. \n\nWe would really like to suggest that people use Markdown, but we cannot do so if it is not available in all contexts.\n\nThanks,\n\nGeoff Brewster\nMoodle Administrator, College of LAS\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ",

    "Description": "Here's something I'd like. Our university has a site-wide IMAP server, but I only want students in our department to get onto our moodle server. If I use IMAP authentication then any students could get in. They wont be able to get onto any courses since they'll have enrolment keys, but they'll still be able to create account records.\n\n\n\nWhat I'm considering is that I would fill the mdl_user database with usernames of our students, use IMAP authentication, but only allow those students already in mdl_user to get in. I cant see a way to do that with the current authentication schemes. I could use an external database, but I'd rather the students used the IMAP authentication since thats the same username/pass as they use for most everything else on campus.\n\n\n\nI'll have a bash at hacking this on to moodle later.",

    "Description": "As moodle user base expands and more languages become supported (hooray!), the value of reliance on uniform (standard) API's for text processing becomes more apparent.\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are problems in mixing locale data encoded in different codesets, because Moodle does not implement logic to first tag and process to a uniform format.  \n\n\n\nBecause user and host systems continue to rely on a variety of codesets for encoding of (other than vanilla ASCII) text, moodle interally should use Unicode for all text processing functions require all locale input be sanity checked/converted to an acceptable unicode format.\n\n\n\nUTF8 provides a variety of benefits and is currently well supported on most user and host systems.  This feature request urges reliance on all UTF8 to address the concerns discussed above.\n\n\n\nThe UTF8 support provided by PHP should be confirmed and appropriate tagging and conversion routines developed to provide user upgrades to a new UTF8 architecture.  Database backend issues may also emerge where assumptions on the backend DB might conflict.  Eg. although mysql and postgres both support UTF8 default codesets are configurable for both, and installation scripts for database creation should be looked at to set the appropriate default codesets at installation.  For upgrades, there maybe some more complicated solutions required to sanititize backend data to UTF8.",

It looks like a bit of work, though, with many possible platform issues.  <a href=http://au.php.net/manual/en/function.utf8-encode.php>http://au.php.net/manual/en/function.utf8-encode.php</a>\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday, 3 July 2003, 09:23 PM:\n\nAlso see: <a href=http://au2.php.net/mbstring>http://au2.php.net/mbstring</a>\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Monday, 7 July 2003, 12:25 AM:\n\nInteresting.  I looked at the links.  It's not a trivial matter and conversion from traditional codesets to UNICODE don't always go both ways.\n\n\n\nI think the ideal would be all Moodle data stored locally as UTF8, with a flag for user's preferred codesets (default to UTF8), and conversion from UTF8 to the user's codeset where feasible.\n\n\n\nBecause of what Unicode is you can't always go from UTF8 to codeset foo (as I recal).  So might not be feasible for all languages.  \n\n\n\nFor example, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (there are others..) all use Chinese characters to one degree or another.  However, the characters do not always look exactly the same and Unicode glyphs usually opt for display as one languages style.\n\n\n\nOn windows platforms all the fonts and codeset conversions are handled interall (most Unices as well), so there's not too big of a problem displaying UTF8 text from language goo, as long as there's a supported font for that language in some codeset.\n\n\n\nThose are browser side issues that probably should be considered.\n\n\n\nI can look at this more carefully in about a month.  I'm really swamped right now with a litigation and some articles (in addition to my other daily excitements..).\n\nFrom James Miller (yositune at yahoo.com) Monday, 7 July 2003, 12:31 AM:\n\nOk, I was reading through that last link and indeed Shift-JIS (SJIS) and the 7-bit esc coded JIS codesets are not supported by PHP.\n\n\n\nThis is consistent with my initial guesses of where there's problems.\n\n\n\nWhether we decide to move to UTF8 or other we should probably put a parser checker in the locale editing class so people can't use the locale admin to enter text as SJIS.\n\n\n\nThis is a very tricky problem as there's not really an easy way of confirming whether a bare input stream is SJIS or EUC.  Could bang the cgi or other variables for codesets and try to match up on the post/get.  Seems like I did somethign like this with a servlet in Java ages ago.\n\n\n\nOne quicky method might be to branch on JA or other locales and just alert users of potential problems.  There is a similiar codeset for Korean as I recal and seems like another was one of the Thai codesets.\n\nFrom Anthony Borrow (aborrow at jesuitcp.org) Monday,  11 July 2005, 10:34 AM:\n\nI submitted a report on MDL-3723 that is related to this feature request. \n\n\n\nSome checks need to be made with MySQL during the installation routine that ensures that the database is not UTF8 or otherwise modify the table structures so that UTF8 is fully supported. \n\n\n\nWith the UTF8 character set I recieved an error Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes when trying to create the config_plugins table. Switching the database to the Latin1 character set resolved this issue.\n\nFrom Petr Skoda (skodak at centrum.cz) Monday,  17 July 2006, 09:51 PM:\n\nfixed in 1.6 - utf8 now supported",

I think she's right! 8-)  She says I can't remember anything either, ... I think she says that.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I've been using the Show news items site setting instead of Show courses.  I see what you mean now.\n\n\n\nI will add that my suggestion is similar except I used My courses as a sideblock, and the news the main focus on the main page (using the Show news items setting).  I personal think I'll keep my setup for a few reasons:\n\n1.  Our course descriptions are pretty long and if a student is enrolled in three or four classes, they will have to do some scrolling to get down to the link.\n\n2.  If a student is already enrolled in a course, I'm not sure they need to see the description anyway.\n\n3.  I want to do it my way.  Because.  So there. LOL.  Sorry, starting to sound like my daugther :-)\n\n4.  I like having my picture on the main page with the News items ;-)\n\n5.  This is getting very, very, VERY bad!\n\n\n\nI also have the My courses sideblock in the weekly format, which may be of use for quick access to other courses the student (or teacher) is enrolled in.  See attachment.\n\n\n\nAll this wasted time ;-)  It's a good thing I enjoy this!\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday, 9 August 2003, 11:32 AM:\n\nLOL\n\n\n\nMine's really quick - I just used existing functions to print the course.\n\n\n\nEventually I was thinking of improving the display, but I agree what you say about the descriptions.  It would be better to have a table there that lists course name and some indication of recent activity (eventually getting fancy with unread posts, grades etc).\n\n\n\nI also agree that when the student is logged in and news is central to the page, that the course sideblock should show just My Courses with a link to all courses.  I hadn't got to that bit yet!  :-)\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday, 9 August 2003, 11:34 AM:\n\nOh, and I really like the idea of putting the sideblock on the course page too!  I'll do that in CVS too - except I'll put it on the right, I think (see your point 3).  LOL\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday, 9 August 2003, 11:34 AM:\n\ner, left\n\nFrom   (scott.elliott at mchsi.com) Saturday, 9 August 2003, 11:39 AM:\n\nright, left, you're the man.  I'm keeping it on the right though :-) (Again, reference number 3).\n\n\n\nOh yeah, I can do some of this if you are busy with other things.  Just assign it to me.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  10 August 2003, 01:26 AM:\n\nDone in CVS.  I love the courses list within the course page - it really works well.  Great idea!\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  10 August 2003, 01:27 AM:\n\nI should add that I've just done the sideblock - the revised format for the main display version I'll look at later.",

    "Description": "I wanted to use the forum module in a HelpDesk\n\npseudo-course to allow students to pose questions\n\nor provide comments to our Helpdesk.  Since we\n\nuse an external authentication method (pop3) any\n\nstudent can participate.  But, if they wished to\n\nremain anonymous, the guest option would not work\n\nfor us, because guests can't post to forums.\n\nI propose a course instructor be able to choose if\n\nguest users could participate in that course's forums.  This presupposes that guests were allowed\n\ninto the course to start with!  Perhaps this should be selectable per-forum?  I recognize that\n\ninviting anonymous posts might also require constant vigilance for appropriate content!\n\n\n\nI have made minor changes to accomplish this, for\n\nforums within a specific course.  I will set the\n\nURL below to where I will place the context-diffs.",

We use an external\n\ndatabase of IDs (SOlaris nis+) and adding an account\n\nwith a known passwd would open more holes than I'd care\n\nto fill!  Also, such an account could have the passwd\n\nchanged to unknown values readily outside moodle, and\n\ncould be subscribed to all sorts of forums, and emailed\n\nto an ever-changing addr as the profile were changed.\n\nHaving a more-closely controlled pseudo-account like\n\nguest offers more security.  But, come to think on it,\n\ncould a guest account initiate email off of moodle to\n\nexternal addresses?  I hope not, or we'd have an open\n\nemail gateway!  I'm a neophyte at moodle, but a long-time paranoid sysadmin!\n\nFrom tom murdock (tom at thinkingdistance.org) Sunday,  10 August 2003, 07:32 PM:\n\ngotcha. that makes sense.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  26 August 2003, 01:23 AM:\n\nA guest account can do bugger-all currently ... I think a custom account is the best method, but this might have to wait until more than one authentication scheme is supported at the same time.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  26 August 2003, 01:24 AM:\n\nI'm going to close this and open another bug to that effect.",

It does not really integrate with the rest of the site though. There is a link in the footer that reads Home. Of course the string could be changed in the localization files or the theme footer could be hard coded, but the default behavior has a link to moodle's sub folder as Home - not Moodle Home.\n\nThe breadcrumbs are specific to the moodle home. So the moodle directory appears by breadcrumbs to be at the top level of the site.\n\n\n\nSo in moodle/lib/weblib.php\n\nI made these changes to print_header\n\nfunction print_header ($title=, $heading=, $navigation=, $focus=, $meta=, $cache=true, $button=?, $menu=, $showMoodle=true) {\n\n//$showMoodle used to determine if breadcrumbs should include Moodle -> in string\n\n[....]\n\n//    if ($navigation == home) {\n\n//        $home = true;\n\n//        $navigation = ;\n\n//    } else {\n\n//        $home = false;\n\n//     }\n\n    if ($navigation == co_home) {\n\n        $home = true;\n\n        $navigation = ;\n\n    } else if ($navigation == mdl_home){\n\n  $home = true;\n\n  $navigation = index.php;\n\n    } else {\n\n        $home = false;\n\n  if(!$showMoodle) {\n\n   $navigation = :.$navigation;\n\n  }\n\n    }\n\n[...]\n\n\n\n\n\nI made these changes to print_footer\n\nfunction print_footer ($course=NULL) {\n\n[...]\n\n/// Course links\n\n    if ($course) {\n\n        if ($course == home) {   // special case for site home page - please do not remove\n\n            $homelink  = <p align=\\center\\><a title=\\moodle $CFG->release ($CFG->version)\\ href=\\http://www.moodle.org/\\ target=\\_blank\\>;\n\n            $homelink .= <br><img width=\\130\\ height=\\19\\ src=\\pix/madewithmoodle.gif\\ border=0></a></p>;\n\n            $course = get_site();\n\n            $homepage = true;\n\n  } else if ($course == co_home) {\n\n            $homelink  = ;\n\n            $course = get_site();\n\n        } else {\n\n            $homelink = <a target=\\{$CFG->framename}\\ href=\\$CFG->wwwroot/course/view.php?id=$course->id\\>$course->shortname</a>;\n\n        }\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nand I made these changes to print_navigation\n\nfunction print_navigation($navigation) {\n\n   global $CFG;\n\n\n\n   if ($navigation) {\n\n       if (! $site = get_site()) {\n\n           $site->shortname = get_string(home);\n\n       }\n\n  if($navigation{0} == :){\n\n   $navigation = substr($navigation, 1, strlen($navigation)-1); \n\n        echo <a target=\\{$CFG->framename}\\ href=\\http://www.MyServer.com/\\>MyServer.com</a> -> \n\n$navigation;\n\n     } else {\n\n        echo <a target=\\{$CFG->framename}\\ href=\\http://www.MyServer.com/\\>MyServer.com</a> -> <a target=\\{$CFG->framename}\\ href=\\$CFG->wwwroot/\\>$site->shortname</a> -> $navigation;\n\n     }\n\n   }else{\n\n       echo <a target=\\{$CFG->framename}\\ href=\\http://www.MyServer.com/\\>MyServer.com</a>;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\n\n\nOne way that I could see this integrated further is if \n\nmoodle/config.php had extra root defines\n\ninstead of just\n\n$CFG->wwwroot   = 'http://www.myserver.com/moodle';\n\n\n\nI propose:\n\n//the URL for the top level of your web site\n\n$CFG->siteroot   = 'http://www.myserver.com';\n\n//the URL to the moodle directory\n\n$CFG->moodleroot   = 'http://www.myserver.com/moodle';\n\n\n\nHope this helps further explain the request :)\n\nDaryl\n\nFrom Petr Skoda (skodak at centrum.cz) Monday,  17 July 2006, 10:08 PM:\n\nThis feature might be useful only for small number of sites, for others theme customization is IMO enough.",

      "26/Jun/07 2:37 AM;712020:2adc098f-c748-4bae-921c-189ec9b62b56;At Tim's suggestion, I am submitting the first draft of the email to teacher code for Moodle 1.8 (Tested on 2007021501). This is written (hopefully) to conform to the spec written by Tim Hunt found here: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Email_notification_when_a_quiz_is_submitted\n\nCapabilities were added to /mod/quiz/db/access.php and they appear in the roles admin screens after bumping the version.php file.\n\nThe following strings were added to /lang/en_utf8/quiz.php:\n'emailconfirmbody'\n'emailconfirmsubject'\n'emailnotifybody'\n'emailnotifysubject'\n'quiz:emailconfirmsubmission'\n'quiz:emailnotifysubmission'\n\nThe main worker function was added to /mod/quiz/locallib.php\n\nThe breakout (calling) code was added around line 407 of /mod/quiz/attempt.php\n\nIn my testing, the notification email is going out OK to 1 teacher. The role was overridden in the course for the role of teacher and given the \"allow\" permission on the mod/quiz:emailnotifysubmission capability. I have yet to test multiple teachers in the same course but the code should work for that.\n\nThe confirmation email is going out for the student. I did a role override for student in the course and gave it the allow permission on the mod/quiz:emailconfirmsubmission capability. Unfortunately the body is not getting populated. Its probably some little typo I have yet to pick up.\n\nI am adding the following files to this tracker for comment:\n/lang/en_utf8/quiz.php\n/mod/quiz/attempt.php\n/mod/quiz/locallib.php\n/mod/quiz/version.php\n/mod/quiz/db/access.php\n\nThe main thing I have not been able to work out is making it group aware. As I am a newby to moodle, I am hoping someone can easily fill in the missing pieces. They probably need adding in the breakout code in attempt.php which is where the decision on who gets emailed happens.\n\nCheers\nGraham",

I have just made a page of instructions: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:How_to_create_a_patch.\n\nI can review your changes in the files you sent, but for the final version, a patch would be much better.\n\nIf you are not sending a patch, or even if you are, it is helpful if you can say, as exactly as possible, which version of Moodle you started from.\n\nI would probably word some of the language string a bit differently, but that is not important.\n\naccess.php, the new capabilites need to be 'captype' => 'read'. Otherwise fine.\n\nIn attempt.php, I was assuming that there would just be\n\n    if ($finishattempt) {\n        quiz_send_notification_emails(...);\n    }\n\nand then all the work would be in that function. You might need that function and several helper functions all in locallib.php (I don't really like the way you have done it with a switch statement). I know none of the rest of attempt.php is like that, but attempt.php is a total mess, and I am gradually trying to make it better, not worse!\n\nNow looking at locallib.php:\n\nIn Moodle, we don't use the standard function error_log, instead we use a moodle function called 'debugging', which is defined in lib/weblib.php.\n\nWhen starting to use a new object by setting $a->coursename etc. You should start with a line $a = new stdClass; to make sure you have a blank object, and do not reference some variable from somewhere else you did not intend to.\n\nTo do the groups thing,  ... actually, it is hard. Leave it for now and I will do it.\n\nSo basically, it is looking pretty good, just a number of minor things; one major thing, which is move as much as possible from attempt.php to localllib.php, and then, if at all possible, make a patch of the changes. Finally, do a bit more testing.\n\nThanks.",
      "26/Jun/07 9:06 PM;712020:2adc098f-c748-4bae-921c-189ec9b62b56;Thanks Tim,\n\nI have noted all your suggestions and have rebuilt the code and created a patch file. I was going to do a patch file but was unsure if that was the prefered or not. Did not see any other references readily that said one way or the other. So thought the total code was going to be easier for you to just review the direction and give comments. No worries.\n\nI am testing / developing on Moodle version 1.8 (2007021501) according to the hover over the moodle icon on the front page. I mentioned this before... is this not the correct version number you are after?\n\nSo I have implemented all that you requested. Hope this code is more to your liking.\n\nAs I am not an experienced online educator, I have not worried at all about the language strings as you will probably want to set those yourself. I just threw something in there to get started as the client will be setting those once they see the result. I did have troubles placing double quotation marks (tried using \\\") which worked sometimes and not others, so I just removed them for now.\n\nI have noticed that placing eol characters (\\n) seems to work in the email but does not display right in the GUI where you edit language strings. I guess the GUI is for editing html strings for display on screen.\n\nI have tested this with  more than one teacher now and all works correctly. It obeys the \"email is disabled\" flag in the user profile.\n\nIt will not send a notification if the student has confirmation set as well. It will send notification to **all** the students when the mod/quiz:emailnotifysubmission role override is set for type student. This is expected behaviour.\n\nSo I think this will be close now Tim.\n\nI leave the group thing up to you and the standard language strings too.\n\nGraham\n\nAttachment: quiz-648-0.1.patch",

    "Description": "I want to add a open social format course to my site to encourage many users from other courses to come together and chat with each other.\n\n\n\nI want to make this course prominent, so it should go at the top.  However, as it is a unique course, it doesn't make sense to put it in a course category.  I doubt there will ever be any other courses that would go with it, so it will remain solitary and would look a little odd in a category with only one member.\n\n\n\nI think it would be a great addition to Moodle 1.1 to have the ability to put something in the courses list without having to nest it in a category.",

Furthermore, I understand that what might appear to be a simple thing to me may not be for the programmer!\n\n\n\nI'm not sure what others think about this.  Maybe I could open up a discussion on one of the forums to see the general feeling?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  27 August 2003, 03:06 PM:\n\nSuch a change would in fact be non-trivial ... all the code assumes courses always belong to a category.  In the simple case there is only one category and it's not displayed, but it's still there.\n\n\n\nIt *might* be possible to mark one category as special so that it gets displayed differently, but this isn't going to happen in 1.1\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday, 9 May 2004, 05:39 AM:\n\nWhy don't you move everything down by one category? As Martin explained, you can not have a course outside all categories. But you can have a course in a site-wide category and then all other courses in sub-categories. That way your special course will look special. You just have to choose a good name for this overall category. perhaps your site name.",

I think that inclusion of time taken to do the test in the moodle database, would prevent the objection that Martin raises to a javascript timer. \n\n\n\nA timer could also, I guess, include a (sytem clock)time when tests started, time when test finished, and time taken so that as well as turning off java during the test, the student would also have to alter their system clock to ensure twts-twtf=tt and this in real time, to the second. This would be impossible for all but super-nerds. \n\n\n\nBy the way, timing is a must for me because:\n\n1) My boss says it is a must (end of story)\n\n2) To prevent copying as genners says\n\n3) To asses students that are answering too quickly (a lot of them just press the buttons and leave)\n\n4) To emulate TOEIC/TOEFL type exams\n\n5) To encourage language aquisition as opposed to learning (language that is accessable at spead is aquired, langauge that is accessable after a period of thought is said to be learnt, and probably not usuable)\n\n6) The other methods of assessment that Martin mentions are not applicable to language education. If my students could take part in activities then I would not been to be giving them loads of vocabulary tests. \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  11 September 2003, 01:10 PM:\n\nJust one correction:  Moodle already does store (and show) time taken for a quiz.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  11 September 2003, 01:17 PM:\n\nAlso, it only takes ONE student in a class to work out the Javascript trick and they will soon all know it, particularly if it means they'll get better grades.  They won't even feel like they're cheating.\n\n\n\nAnother example is that in some browsers you can hold down the mouse button to pause the clock.\n\n\n\nTeachers who don't understand the technology may not realise what is going on, and if they do Moodle will get the blame for a shoddy implementation.\n\n\n\nIt becomes a spiralling arms race of security vs cheating - I've seen it before on other systems and it's not something I want to buy in to. Others are free to implement this but I'm personally not keen on it.\n\nFrom   (cernagenr at central.adzu.edu.ph) Friday,  12 September 2003, 08:11 AM:\n\nMaybe we could use the sever time in limiting the time in taking exam... It's a new whole challenge when it comes to security. \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  12 September 2003, 08:25 AM:\n\nPlease stop changing the priority unless you're offering to write the code.\n\nFrom   (cernagenr at central.adzu.edu.ph) Friday,  12 September 2003, 08:29 AM:\n\nSorry for that cause I'm into research about this things...",

Selecting a parent category does not show the questions in all its subcategories. I think there should be an option to make it do that. I'll have a look at whether that is feasible.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday, 6 January 2005, 02:18 AM:\n\nI have added an option to show the questions in all subcategories of the selected category. This is not quite what you asked for but if you put all your categories as subcategories into a All category then it does what you want.\n\n\n\nBecause there can be quite a lot of questions I also implemented paging for the list of questions.\n\n\n\nFrom P.

      "24/Aug/06 1:24 PM;712020:6373ec6e-2a10-4a86-9493-052782609013;I got a \"work has stopped\" message on this one too. \"Work stopped\" may mean nothing, but even so I will take this opportunity to comment some more. \n\nWhen I posted the above I did not know what I meant.\n\nWhile there are some online survey systems that provide the option to actually block test attempts from multiple users on the same machine, I don't think that many teachers would want to do this. I would not. \n\nHowever the ability to show which attempts where made from a the same machine would be nice. \n\nAnother way of doing this would be to show the IP address of the attempt. And that would be nice too. \n\nHowever there are many situations where multiple machines share IP addresses. Uur computer labs all have the same IP address I think. \n\nIf a cookie method were used, it would show where people have logged off as one user and then logged on again as another user, even while there is a cookie for the other user left on the machine. \n\nStudents could delete all cookies and circumvent this check. But a lot of them would not know to do so. So the ability to keep track of both IP address and (this bug) \"attempt from machine which also has cookie for user X\" (?) would add information to help instructors maintain an awareness of possible cheating. \n\nObviously, just because multiple attempts were made from the same machine/environment does not proove that the students who made them were cheating, but if the attempts were particularly similar, and the students (or a subset of them) are getting noticably higher marks in tests than they are in class, then, well evidence adds up. \n\nTim",
      "24/Aug/06 1:50 PM;557058:5188c7d7-5671-48d1-b501-6c3ae2b91f34;I'm afraid I don't agree with this bug at all.\n\nFor a start IP address is a very vague way of identifying anything, and cookies are no better.\n\nIn Moodle, we have a proper authentication system: people log in with usernames and passwords. If students are abusing the system and you have people logging on with each other's accounts, then you have serious problems that go way beyond the quiz module. In fact, it is a disciplinary problem that can probably only be soved outside Moodle.\n\nHowever, if you are suspicious about certain behavior, then there are the Moodle logs, which do record what everyone has been doing on the site (including which IP address they are doing it from). As I say, the problem extends beyond the quiz module, so the central logs are the correct place to try to tackle this.\n\nIf the interface for searching the logs isn't good enough, that is a separate issue. The the quiz module does not add good enough entries to the logs for some actions, then that is also a separate issue.\n\nTherefore, marking this one wontfix.",
      "24/Aug/06 2:26 PM;712020:6373ec6e-2a10-4a86-9493-052782609013;Good morning. I am not sure of the meaning of \"Won't fix.\" Does this only refer to your own kind endeavour Tim? Or will the Won't fix label affect the efforst of other programmers?\n\nI am aware of the authentication system in Moodle. In my recent comment, I am not talking about the scenario where students are sharing the same Moodle account, but different accounts on the same machine (or environment), in the cookie cache of which, there are cookies for other accounts. E.g. if I were to log off on this machine and attempt to log on again as another user, I think that Moodle would know that there is a moodle cookie for the original user on the machine. \n\nI am also aware that moodle logs IP addresses but the logs do not record multiple cookies in the sense described above. \n\nIn my experience it is only on the testing modules answer sharing becomes a problem. \n\nThe interface to search the logs could be improved so that one could search for users of a certain module....Hmm...I am not sure why this is more of a logs issue. \n\nIt is possible to go from the quiz results page to the logs and cross reference between the two to see if similar test responses were submitted from the same IP adress but it is very hard if there has been a lot of other use, by other users at the same time. \n\nIn order for the logs to provide the information regarding possible quiz answer sharing, the logs would also have to display the responses and scores (and their similarity). \n\nI agree that both cookies and IP address are vague ways of indentify things but I believe that they are usefull additional information in the hands of the earnest teacher. This reminds me of the claim that javascript prevention of copying is similarly vague (or insecure) and therefore of no use. It is in fact tremendously useful, because it stops some people from cheating. Similarly information about cookies woudl stop some students from cheating. This information would add up.",
      "25/Aug/06 12:14 AM;557058:5188c7d7-5671-48d1-b501-6c3ae2b91f34;'Won't fix' means that I as module owner think that it is not a good idea to implement the feature suggestion. I always think that phrase sounds rather abrut and rude, but it's the one that all bug trackers seem to use.\n\nWhat you are asking for is a way to detect possible cheating. I am convinced that a cookie is not going to help there. The best way to detect this is to look at the results that were actually entered by each student. If there is evidence of copying there, that is the strongest evidence there could be. Automatic plagiarism detection is a subject in its own right, and not one I know very much about. It would be a great project to give a bright university student one summer (perhaps next year's google Summer of Code?). They could implement a new quiz report pugin that compared answers from different students to look for possible cheating. It could even combine some data from the logs too if that turned out to be effective.\n\nAnd securlty is not solvable just with technology. You need to think of the whole picture. As a comparison what do you do with paper tests? If it is an important test, you probably don't let your students take it away and do it in their own time when they can copy from each other or books. Instead you call it an exam, and insist that they do it with an invigilator watching them to make sure they don't cheat.",
      "25/Aug/06 1:22 AM;712020:6373ec6e-2a10-4a86-9493-052782609013;I respect your opinion. I can only hope that as you suggest there are others that may be interested in supplying the relevant code. \n\nFor my own part, I realise that I could use an invigilator, but alas that would eat into class time in which I prefer to use for communication. Thus, the central focus of online testing is for me, how to make it as secure as possible. To that end, praise be your module, \nRandom ordering of questions and answers\nRandom banks of question variations\nQuiz timing\nJavascript making coping more difficult\nIP address logging \nUser authentication (at least in terms of passwords)\nprovided by the Moodle quiz module at present, are a way of moving invigilation out of the classroom. Of course security will never be complete, but as the layers of security provisions build up, Moodle provides a method of testing that could never have been achieved with pencil and paper homework tests. At my school there is an even more foul attempt to use pencil and paper tests. The course which I run, using moodle, is doing a lot better I believe. It could work a lot better still.  \n\n",

Clicking it could bring up the summary info (if there).  It could be a 'real' activity displayed in the Activities box etc, and could act as an entry point to an HTML anchor position within the course - so clicking 'Bookmarks' in the activity box would bring up a list of 'BookMark' definitions within the course - clicking one would then take the user to that position in the course.\n\n \n\nAn enhancement could be to have one for each Learner on the course - 'myBookmark', which was updated automatically as they moved through the activities, and would represent a link to where they last were within the course.",

Re course checking: sort of - one big issue with the link check, or rather with moodle itself, is that you have no idea what you are scraping until you scrape it. You can't filter to certain courses based only on urls for example. We have plans to add filtering so it will exclude certain courses or pages inside categories, but it still needs to visit the page to figure out what course it is, and then ignore it and not follow any page links.\r\n\r\nScraping a full course could take a very long time depending on the course, you definitely want this running in cron and not live. eg even a single moderately complex book module could have heaps of pages and links, and that's just one activity. I think what you want instead is linking to the reports filtered to just one course which you can already do but perhaps the UI needs a bit more love. If you have recently made a change you can trigger a prioritized re-scrape of that page, this is implemented but again it may need more UI tweaks. Alternatively you could give a seed url of the course page and only give the robot access to that one course, but that would stop anyone else from testing their courses.\r\n\r\nIf you want to block older archived courses there is a better way which I am in the process of documenting, where you can create a new role like 'norobot' which removes the view capability and then you can add that role to the robot user in the cateogories you don't want scraped.\r\n\r\nAlso FYI this plugin isn't yet published in the plugins dir, we are currently polishing this, and as part of that we will probably change it's type from a local plugin to either an admin tool or a report plugin. I'll ping this tracker when it is published.",

A lecturer could request their course to be checked for dead links and we'd provide them with a list of dead links within say 48hrs. Then if all is well further down the line we could have the report available to all lecturers.\r\n\r\nCould you let me know how to send a seed URL of one course page to the script please?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nMike",
      "04/May/16 3:07 AM;557058:c1816d26-9b59-4fca-9dfd-09d5e132d03d;hi Mike,\r\n\r\nThe plugin is throttled so it has near constant light load and processes the url queue slowly over many cron ticks. You can also schedule the crawler task to only run at certain hours via the task admin gui if you want. In the crawler config are two items for tuning the throttling depending on your cron setup if needed but the defaults are fine.\r\n\r\nTo test just a single course wasn't really something we designed if for but you could sort of coble it together something like:\r\n\r\na) only give the robot user access to and visibility of that one course (maybe a custom role)\r\nb) set the seed url to that course page (can be set in the admin gui local_linkchecker_robot | seedurl of forced in config.php)\r\nc) let it run to completion either via cron or run the crawler cli in a loop outside the normal cron\r\nd) give the lecturer the results, probably exporting is in some way\r\ne) run the reset cli and rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few caveats with this, \r\n1) pretty manual, no self serve\r\n2) only one course can be checked at a time (or you could add the robot to X courses and run them as a batch, but not sure how to seed them, would depend on front page or category access to the courses)\r\n3) the reports are only around until you reset it\r\n4) there currently isn't a way to export the results (I've added this to the todo list)\r\n\r\nSo you could do it, but don't think it's worth the bother and would be clunky. I think it would be better to just use it as-is OR alternatively we'd implement a new feature where a lecturer can self service and add their course to a list of seed urls, it's get processed in the next crawl session. Then their course seed url drops off and the current course reports function as they do now. If you want to sponsor that send me a PM",

One way of overcoming this might be to indicate within the category definition whether its contents are to be maintained alphabetically, and if this flag were set, then:-\n\n\n\n1. Auto alpha-sort on entry/edits/deletes\n\n2. Get rid of positioning arrows\n\n3. Present alpha rather than numeric page selection\n\n\n\nJust one take - I'm sure there are others.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday, 1 June 2004, 03:41 PM:\n\nYes, Gustav is thinking of the users page.",

    "Description": "I know manipulating the database directly is fairly unusual.  We're acting upon triggers raised by our MIS Oracle database for enrolments, new courses etc to automatically add users and courses to Moodle.  The system is working fine for now, but is there any chance of protecting us from ourselves as far as is reasonable.  \n\n\n\nWithin the interface, you don't offer a student (or tutor?) who is already a participant to be added, so there is inherent protection that way.  As a test, I manually duplicated the last entry in mdl_user_students in terms of UserID and CourseID and it allowed it.  The system wasn't in use so no harm done - I deleted the record.\n\n\n\nIs it possible within the MySQL structures to indicate in some way that the two fields combined must be unique?  Same for mdl_user_teacher and I suspect mdl_user_admin etc.  Maybe there are other fields in the tables that might be better if the underlying field attributes protected against manual/automation errors.",

The easier way is to let the teacher make the different formats.\n\nAn extra option might be to make certain formats available to students (html/pdf) and others only to (fellow-)teachers (e.g. MS-word/OOwriter).",

The biggest complaint is that once the file gets to the teacher, it is difficult to grade online.  They want to be able to give comments (more than the quickgrade) and get it back to the student easily.  This is time consuming.  If there were a way to create an online rubric that the teacher could use online and comment on that would automatically be on the student account (without the need to upload back to student) would be absolutely awesome.  I teach at MSU and we have that type of portfolio where the student uploads the file to the assignment in the portfolio. I can open it and view it. I can use the rubric to score it and give comments and that is saved back to the student portfolio where they can see that.\n\nI would love to have that for my K-12 building.  This should be more than a minor status.  This would be huge!",
      "14/Nov/09 1:33 AM;5b4e1b8cb84bc45fea9605e4;In Moodle 2.0, Workshop module can be set up so that it behaves like a simple Assignment module, just having the advanced grading methods available (rubrics etc). Basically there are three checkboxes for every workshop instance that the teacher can use to turn the feature on/off\n[ ] use self assessment\n[ ] use peer assessment\n[ ] use assessment of example submissions\n\nIf all these are off, you have quite simple Assignment-like module with the possibility to use your own assessment form. So instead of incorporating Workshop features into Assignment, you can use the simplified mode of Workshop that actually works similar to the Assignment (covering all three subtypes - Online text, Single upload and partially Advanced upload).",

As I understand it, it pertains to defining a rubric which can be used to assess an assignment. The code for the assignment version was shared at http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=1642 and I figured it might be good to be aware of the functionality there and how your work with the workshop module may provide similar capabilities.

At the moment, if I create a workshop with a complex rubric and I want to use that rubric again then I need to re-create it many times. Would be great if the marking form was a separate entity that I could grab as needed, plug in to an assignment, glossary or forum, and have the marks sent through to the gradebook.\n\nI know this is probably going way beyond the initial discussion, but I thought I'd throw in the idea before this ticket (which surely must be among the oldest remaining open ones) is put to sleep.\n\nThoughts welcome!\n\nMark.",
      "13/Nov/10 5:44 AM;557058:ad4396bc-c0c2-4271-b0a9-df80010113dc;Mark - Thanks for your input. Being able to bring over a set of rubrics sounds like it would be a useful feature. I am curious if and how a particular rubric item might related to outcomes. I've not played much with the new workshop module yet to see how outcomes are dealt with. I suspect they are not so much related to the rubric as much as to the submission itself. I thought it might be interesting though if we had an outcome whereby students were expected to be able to recognize something (say subject/verb agreement) and the teacher could give credit to the students evaluating another's work to indicate that they had mastered that. I realize that such functionality with complicate the grading mechanism since the teacher would be grading the evaluators as well as those making the submissions. I am just curious if that type of functionality might be helpful to teachers. Perhaps my idea would be better discussed in the forums. Peace - Anthony ",

This is exactly what the Workshop does, but I can't un-plug that rubric from the workshop and then re-use it in other assignments in my course, which would be ideal.\n\nHope that makes sense,\n\nMark. ",
      "09/Jun/11 7:32 PM;712020:e735d282-3f92-4c2c-a6cd-87d20529d25c;I agree with Mark. The mechanism for using a rubric in the new workshop module is good but it is awkward to use after that. \nWhen I set an assignment I want to be able to either click the \"out of\" or \"scales\" option or click a \"use a rubric\" option. This would take me into something like the workshop rubric setup which seems OK but with someone who knows something about UI design could be made better. I have in mind a \"scoring rubric\" This would be very popular with users. ",
      "10/Jun/11 5:18 AM;557058:ad4396bc-c0c2-4271-b0a9-df80010113dc;Just to be clear, the use of a rubric is really not too much more that allowing multiple grades to be assigned and calculated. As an example, a writing assignment could be graded on:\n\nCreativity: 0-10 pts\nSpelling and grammar: 0-20 pts\nOrganization: 0-20 pts\n\nOne thought I had was that rather than duplicating the complexity of the grade book with weighted grades and trying to say that Creativity is worth 20%, Spelling and grammar worth 40%, Organization worth 40% is probably something we want to avoid; however, we need to think about how grades will be calculated for rubrics which often times may be scales rather than points. As Martin stated earlier, we really need to work toward developing a good spec for what this would look like and how it will work. Otherwise, I fear there is a bit of a danger that folks will have very different ideas about what is expected and end up rather frustrated. Part of that will be differentiating the grading rubrics from outcomes. My thought is that by using a rather specific example we may be able to come to some agreement. \n\nPeace - Anthony \n",

So I would like to implement a button that logs the teacher in as an arbitrary one of his students. The question is only: where should the button go and what should it be called? Login as student? I think it should go behind the Your are logged in as .....\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday,  30 May 2004, 10:08 AM:\n\nI have now also posted this on the forums at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8445 to get some feedback on how to best implement this.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  27 December 2004, 04:17 AM:\n\nI have put a Login as Student link into the admin block. If you think that some people may not like it I could provide a block configuration option for it and turn it off by default. Just let me know.\n\n\n\nI would also suggest changing the language string that shows on the confirmation page after having logged in as someone else. The string should contain an explanation of how the user can log in as themselves again.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  27 December 2004, 10:27 AM:\n\nSorry, I don't know what you've been drinking over Xmas but this is not good at all ...  I've undone that change.  \n\n\n\nPlease make your own block if you want such a random login button.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  27 December 2004, 03:33 PM:\n\nWell, this was a frequently requested feature. Our teachers like to reassure themselves frequently what students see. I assume teachers elsewhere are similar and furthermore this has been an open bug here for quite some while. \n\nWhat exactly do you not like about the link? \n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday, 2 January 2005, 03:24 PM:\n\nI am assigning this back to Martin.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 2 January 2005, 04:29 PM:\n\nIt was the random student choosing (great potential for confusion and data corruption by teachers blundering around trying things) and the extra database call on each page load that I didn't like ... it would be fine as an optional block for those that wanted that but it shouldn't be on every course page by default.\n\n\n\nInterface-wise Howard's idea of changing of turn editing on into a menu that says \n\n  - view editing controls\n\n  - view as a student\n\n\n\nmakes sense to me.\n\n\n\nThe second option could lead to a page the first time that lists all the available students and asks you to pick one, with a checkbox to always use this student (saved as a user preference).  Selecting someone sends you to the correct loginas URL.  If the user preference is found in future then skip the selection process.\n\n\n\nAnother thought is to have a special standard user like Guest (but called Student View) that is only availble for this purpose ... Assuming security concerns could be sorted out (ie you could only access courses you already had access to) then this would be ideal and would prevent any type of possible data loss. \n\n\n\nThe existing loginas function should be retained where it is for debugging and for special situations like groups and so on ...\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Thursday, 9 March 2006, 09:36 PM:\n\nNow in 1.6dev",

Here are updated instructions:\n\n\n\nIn moodle/mod/forum/lib.php\n\n   You no longer need to edit the forum_cron function in 1.4.5.\n\n\n\nFind the function forum_print_post\n\n(function forum_print_post(&$post, $courseid, $ownpost=false, $reply=false, $link=false, $ratings=NULL, $footer=, $highlight=) { )\n\n\n\nIn that function find this area:\n\n    $age = time() - $post->created;\n\n    if ($ownpost or $adminedit) \n\n\n\nChange the line that looks similar to:\n\n if (($age < $CFG->maxeditingtime) or $adminedit \n\n\n\nTo the following to allow any teacher with edit rights to edit posts AND allows users to edit their own posts at any time if the config is set to 0:\n\n     //edit by Daryl Hawes to allow editing if maxeditingtime is 0\n\n        if (($age < $CFG->maxeditingtime) or $adminedit or isteacheredit($courseid) or ($CFG->maxeditingtime == 0)) {\n\n\n\nOr to this which just adds the ability for any user to edit their own posts if maxeditingtime is set to 0:\n\n        if (($age < $CFG->maxeditingtime) or $adminedit or ($CFG->maxeditingtime == 0)) {\n\n\n\nModify the moodle/admin/config.html file as listed above including dlnsk's suggestion of using the 'always' string.\n\n\n\nModify the lang file. The string above actually has an error so use something like this:\n\n//edited by Daryl Hawes to allow no max edit time out\n\n$string['configmaxeditingtime'] = 'This specifies the amount of time people have to re-edit forum postings, journal feedback etc.  Usually 30 minutes is a good value. NOTE: To always allow editing select 0.';\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  21 April 2006, 09:25 AM:\n\nYeah, I still have real problems allowing this because I think it has potential to break the fragile ecosystem of an online course, as discussed in the moodle.org forums.",

      "26/Oct/07 6:32 PM;712020:00374572-278c-4c0f-8edd-0536e94eef7f;I discovered a simple solution: extend the time of editing.  Do the following:\n\n1. Open moodle/administration/settings/security.html in suitable editor.  I used Dreamweaver 4.0.\n\n2. Revise last line of the array as follows:\n\nget_string('configmaxeditingtime','admin'), 2700,\n             array(60 => get_string('numminutes', '', 1),\n                   300 => get_string('numminutes', '', 5),\n                   900 => get_string('numminutes', '', 15),\n                   1800 => get_string('numminutes', '', 30),\n                   2700 => get_string('numminutes', '', 45),\n                   7257600 => get_string('numminutes', '', 120960))));\n\nNote: I chose 7257600 seconds (=120960 minutes) because this equals 12 weeks.  Any suitable time period can be chosen. \n\n3. Save and PUT security.html into moodle files using a ftp transfer.\n\n4. Open up your Moodle sites and log on as \"Administrator.\"  Go to the Site Administration/Security/Site Policies.  Find the \"Maximum time to edit posts\" and select \"120960\" within the drop-down selection box.  Go to the bottom of the page and \"Save Changes.\"\n\nHaving done this, participants can now edit their posts for 12 weeks.  At the Catherine of Siena Virtual College, classes can run up to 10 weeks. The extra two weeks enables participants to edit/delete their material during the two weeks following the end of class. From that point onward, materials become the property of the College and can be used to promote the course for forthcoming participants/students.  For details, see http://www.catherinecollege.net/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=139\n\nAaron"

A nice setting indeed. However, I added this code to try to ensure that the email address itself is never displayed on a web page at all.

Moodle is Awesome. THANK YOU!!\n\n\n\nThe aim is to provide independent singing teachers, performance schools and educational institutes the ability to create courses and interact with students over the internet, plus advertise information on their online and offline courses/services for public viewing.\n\n\n\nBecause of the offline aspect and as the teachers are based worldwide, it would be very useful if there was a Teacher Search function which would allow people to find teachers and schools in their locality/country and a 'hide' function for teachers who are not currently enrolling or do not wish to be included in the search results.\n\n\n\nThis might be an attractive feature to other Moodle users and could even be extended to include participating moodle users sites ..\n\n\n\nI'm playing around with the colour schemes at the moment and hope to have a new skin available that matches my site for you to look at soon.... also..possibly a template... which you are welcome to add to the collection if suitable...! \n\n\n\nThanks\n\nTracey",

The consistent GUI approach here is that a name and picture is enough to identify a known person  - for deeper information click on the name or picture.\n\n\n\nI'll turn your question around and ask why would you want to use print_user in a module?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday,  10 January 2004, 11:52 PM:\n\nMy idea behind wanting to use print_user everywhere is consistency. For example I would find it better if the user display in the groups participants list looked identical to the user display in the course participants list. The Moodle user gets used to the fact that he has certain information and links available in the course participants list (produced with print_user) and gets confused if he can't find the same features in other participants lists.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday,  11 January 2004, 12:44 AM:\n\nI completely agree for that case ... the current groups pages were simply quick stand-ins but using print_user ij that location makes good sense.\n\n\n\nSee latest CVS  ... print_user is now in weblib.php and user/lib.php has been completely abolished!\n\n\n\nI still wouldn't want to see the big user display overused around the place but you're right that these functions should be centrally available.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday,  11 January 2004, 12:49 AM:\n\nThanks. And I completely agree that the big user display should not be used in other pages.",

    "Description": "Some teachers are concerned that there is no authentication on the school moodle server until you login to a course. Their profile details are thus public. We are just a small secondary school. Beyond some parents, we don't have outsiders logging in to use moodle on our site. There probably should be an site option to authenticate on the main login page. The default should probably be the current setup but some schools might like to authenticate at the start as we do. I was able to do this ourself with 1.2 by adding one line of code into the index.php page. Keep up the great work lads. Moodle is taking over several schools in Victoria Australia. :-)",

There should be an optional index.php page with the login and a link to the registration page in the upper half of the page.  I really think the area where the statement You are logged in as PERSON NAME is the best area for it.\n\n\n\nAfter a user logs in the area should covert to the statement above.  It would be nice to also add a feature where a user would be notified if a Private Message had been left for him/her ( I know there is no private messaging right now - really thinking of the future.)\n\n\n\nI think folks who register their students will like this.  It gets the student (and teacher) into the site quicker.\n\n\n\nWP1\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday, 6 January 2004, 07:25 PM:\n\nLike this?   <a href=http://olc.harte-hanks.com/>http://olc.harte-hanks.com/</a>\n\nFrom Roland Gesthuizen (rolandg at netspace.net.au) Tuesday,  14 June 2005, 10:37 PM:\n\nWe could probably close this one as the new site feature allow you to tweak settings with google etc to hide either the login page, profile information etc.",

    "Description": "I currently use a journal entry as a note book.  The students can take notes in the 'Notes' journal.\n\n\n\nHowever, this is very limited since it only works for a lecture format.  If students are looking at inline web link resources, they cannot be in the notebook at the same time.\n\n\n\nIt would be nice to have a notebook module that used an icon(link) in the description of a resource linking to the students' personal notebook as a new window.  \n\n\n\nWhen the icon is clicked the notebook appears, as an always on top window, for editing. When the window is closed the notebook saves automitically, or with a prompt, and disappears from the screen.\n\n\n\nThis would be very helpful to continue developing a paperless classroom.",

    "Description": "At least in portugese, the boxes which are groups of disciplines should have a diferent variable than the one used for courses.  discipline (disciplina) is the term used to describe 1 course; course (curso) means A LOT of disciplines grouped together. If we translate it as disciplina it would sound funny... if we translate it as curso... well...\n\nIf a student doesn't visit a discipline for a long time, probably would receive a message saying that his course was anuled. That would in fact alarm the student!",

Does the export function work for you? And you really meant to move or rather to copy?\n\n\n\nWill\n\nFrom tom murdock (tom at thinkingdistance.org) Monday,  19 January 2004, 12:45 AM:\n\nI was thinking about moving selectively.\n\n\n\nFor example: kids filled 2 glossaries for me this week.  Some posted the wrong thing in the wrong glossary.  If I could click on a jump like the forum one: Move this discussion to ..., I could pop it into the correct glossary.  \n\n\n\nAlso, sometimes big glossaries get filled with interesting stuff that might be better organized in smaller, more distinct ones.  This tool could make the switching easier.  \n\n\n\nSo essentially, it would copy the data from the current glossary, and add a new concept to whatever glossary is chosen in the drop-down.  Then it would delete the concept from the current glossary.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps clarify.  Thanks for looking!\n\nFrom Petr Skoda (skodak at centrum.cz) Thursday,  13 May 2004, 11:25 PM:\n\nwill not make it into 1.3 :-(",

It's been around since the sixties, after all. Any replacement of symbols inside a TeX equation will break it immediately. So a TeX filter certainly has to run before any other filter.\n\n\n\nThe way around this is to have a universal filter as part of format_text that passes everything inside start tag - end tag pairs through a registered filter.\n\n\n\nOne way to implement this would be to have a table mdl_filters with fields 'id', 'start tag', 'end tag', 'filter', where 'filter' somehow specifies the filter to be applied (for example by giving the name of the subdirectory of the filter directory where it can be found).\n\n\n\nThe current mechanism for calling textfilters would then only be used for filters that aren't triggered by tags, like the glossary filter for example.\n\n\n\nThis is now definitely something for 1.3. However there is no 1.3 in the Version box in this bug tracker. I will post this message in the textfilter thread as well because someone else may have a good idea.\n\nFrom Christian Lebe (christian at moodle.com) Thursday,  20 April 2006, 12:07 PM:\n\nAnother one, Delius :-) Could we close this?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Friday,  21 April 2006, 04:19 AM:\n\nHi Christian, I am actually Gustav :-)\n\n\n\nI have changed this to a feature request and given it a low priority.",

In case b, the submit button should probably be renamed to sth like post anonymously to forum.\n\n\n\nMoodle would store posts as it does now but in case b (for all posts) and c (for posts requested to be anonymous) set a flag in the database (an extra field) that marks a given post as anonymous.  \n\n\n\nThe code that displays posts would check this flag and use a different branch to display them, giving user name as anonymous and using the generic user image.\n\n\n\nThe mail sending code would also have to have a branch to specify sender as anonymous <noreply@xxx.yyy>. \n\n\n\nThis would eliminate extensive changes in other library functions as suggested in Timothy's hack (cf http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=22530).\n\n\n\nThis would also eliminate a need for signing up under dummy names, thus allowing otherwise normal use of other course activities, and in extreme cases it would allow admins to track down users making inappropriate posts.",

The patch is incomplete in that it lacks database migration hooks, but these should be simple for a more experienced Moodle developer to add ;-)  The new columns to support this feature are:\n\nforum:\nanonymous int2 DEFAULT 0, -- 0, 1, 2 = no, yes, optional\n\nforum_posts:\nanonymous int2 DEFAULT 0\n\nWhen creating a forum, you can now specify if posts should be anonymous, not anonymous, or optionally anonymous.  In the latter case, users are presented with a checkbox that they can tick if they want their post to be anonymous.\n\nAnonymous posts get hidden from the post history on the user's profile, as well as the recent activity block and recent activity full report.  When displayed and emailed, the anonymous posts are attributed to the name specified in $CFG->anonymous_name (e.g. 'Anonymous Student'), with current_theme()/pix/anonymous.png used as their picture.\n\nIf anyone discovers or knows of other areas where anonymous forum posts would be displayed improperly please let me know.",

      "10/Feb/09 10:17 AM;5d795d5af794970dbfeb4517;Anonymity support that would apply everywhere in Moodle would be good.  Some things are very hard to do just in a single module.\n\nHere is my patch #3 (anonymous_forums_rev2p3.patch, which applies on top of anonymous_forums_rev2.patch), which fixes the following issues:\n- anonymize RSS feeds\n- don't count anonymous posts in user's post count (can give clues about who wrote an anonymous post)\n- don't show anonymous posts in user's full report\n- don't show anonymous posts in user's recent activity\n- update anonymous post status when post is updated (in case forum setting was changed)\n- post author was still revealed in digest emails\n\nRemaining issues that I'm aware of:\n- if you set the anonymity setting of the forum, and later change it (e.g. from always anonymous to never anonymous), then that setting is not honoured in all places (e.g. in searches)\n- when an anonymous post is mailed, the custom mail headers are not set.  This is due to $userfrom being assigned to a string, which discards $userfrom->customheaders.  Without making changes to email_to_user, the only way to fix this is to, instead of assigning $userfrom to a string, do something like assign $userfrom->firstname to $CFG->forum_anonymousname, $userfrom->lastname to '', and $userfrom->email to $CFG->noreplyaddress.\n- some forum types probably don't make sense with some anonymity types.  e.g. \"Q and A forum\" and \"Each person posts one discussion\" e.g.:\n-- should anonymous posts count as the \"one discussion topic\" that each person is allowed to post?  Right now, it does.  It probably doesn't make sense to allow anonymous posts to _start_ topics in these forum types, even if you want to allow other posts to be anonymous.\n\nMoral of the story: anonymity is very hard to do.",
      "20/Feb/09 7:59 PM;557058:a78cc743-f5bb-4f3b-840b-3e507eb0d3a3;Hi, finally catching up on some of my dev plans/work. Martin and I had discussed an anonymous mode in moodle that would work for all the activities. The basic idea being that \"teachers\" could switch an activity (forum, chat, etc) into anonymous mode. There would also be capabilities that would determine who could view the real name of users. Users could either add an anonymous name in their profile or moodle would revert to a language string eg \"Anonymous\"\n\nMany thanks for the patches and comments. At a quick glance I think there is some important work and ideas done here. I'll start some documention at the docs site as soon as I can and then post the link back here and hopefully we can get the ball rolling on this.\n",

      "26/Feb/09 8:39 AM;5d795d5af794970dbfeb4517;It all depends on what level of anonymity you want.  If you want it to be impossible to recover the true identity, then yes, you would replace the user's ID with the anonymous user's ID in the database.  However, it seems like the way Moodle wants to do things is to keep the user's ID in the database, so that the identity can be recovered, which means that a lot of obfuscation needs to be done.",

Generally speaking, I think it is good practice to log all activity. In fact, I would want an admin to specifically turn logging off for anonymous activities.

Along similar lines, you could create a user and give the students the ability to login as the role (i.e. Superman). The issue is verifying that it is in fact your students that are role playing. If I want folks to role play, at least as I conceptualize role playing from my counselor training days, I could create a forum and ask particular students to take on a particular role. Personally, I would still want to know the real identity of those students so that I can give them credit for their work. Could you provide a link to some of the relevant pedagogical literature so that I can get a better understanding of how this might really work? Peace - Anthony",

If it is forced or not allowed, the checkbox does not appear.  This is actually presented as three options when creating the forum: \"Yes, always\" \"Yes, optional\", and \"No, never\".\n\nAnthony - Installations which use external authentication sources such as LDAP and/or Kerberos typically do not allow end users (even teachers) to create user accounts as it complicates things for the sysadmins.

From a somewhat theoretical perspective, I wonder why anonymity would be helpful and if there is something about social constructionism that discourages anonymity. If there is a preference within social constructionism to use one's true identity then that may explain why Moodle which is based on a social constructionist pedagogy would not be all that interested in adding this feature.

      "23/Aug/12 8:40 AM;557058:ad4396bc-c0c2-4271-b0a9-df80010113dc;My other thought is that as a teacher, it is really hard to give credit to a student for work done anonymously. That said, it would not seem that hard to code an anonymous forum activity module based off of the current forums activity module and just have it not display the names of the students or provide a link to their profile. Overall though I think that not providing the name hinders both teacher and fellow students from responding to a real person with a real history and identity. In any case, those are my thoughts for what they are worth. Peace - Anthony \n\np.s. - Thinking back to when I was helping to write some code to anonymize feedback submissions, you may have to make other code changes to ensure that the identity of the poster is in fact hidden.

I think in ideally students would feel free to share whatever questions they might have but I recognize we do not live in an ideal world. There is just something about it that seems to go against the grain of the types of transparent interactions desired in a social constructionist setting. I'm not expert, I'm simply trying to provide a possible reason why it may not have been prioritized. I worked on a patch that required teacher approval before being seen publicly by others precisely because it was not a feature I saw ever getting into core but because I could see where in a business sector it made sense.

I thought that people should have to own (i.e. take responsibility for) their comments and ideas. However, here in Japan (see also James P's comment way back in May 2007) such a feature would be extremely welcome. Not all the time, but in certain situations, e.g. a \"silly\" questions  forum (see Andrew P's comments). Also, some Moodling educators in the UK have told me that an anon feature would be really helpful in certain online courses and situations.\n\nI have not had a chance to try the patch developed by Teresa G, but the way she describes it sounds like it fits the bill. I like the idea that the user still owns the post and that teachers can see who has posted what. Perhaps, if students are given the option to post anonymously, and they take the option an automatic warning should appear reminding them that although their post will be anonymous to peers, their teacher (or admin?) can see who has posted what should circumstances require.",

I had started a spec but never fully finished it, but essentially it incorporated the following:\n\n1. Allow users in their profile to specify an alternate display name;\n\n2. Using the context levels (specifically course and activity) allow teachers (based on a capability) to set an anonymous mode. One of the following:\n- a. Off - runs exactly as it does now;\n- b. Anonymous - No names are displayed or displayed as \"Anonymous User\" (language string)\n- c. Roles - Use the alternate name that users specify in their profile;\n- d. Optional - Allow users to choose one of the above.\n\n3. Everywhere the user id is stored in the db (for display purposes) there would need to be an additional flag to specify the anonymous mode;\n\n4. An additional capability to allow viewing of a users real name\n\nThe fullname() function in moodle would need an overhaul and some serious testing done to ensure it worked efficiently given it's wide usage.\n\nAside from the practical implementation, I think there are a wide range of possible uses for such a development:\n1. Anonymous forum posting as outlined here. Especially in circumstances where there are sensitive questions being asked;\n2. Anonymous assignment and grading - while this is part of the spec for the assignment in 2.4 I think a generic anonymous solution is preferable;\n3. Role playing - students take on roles for a particular activity or course;\n4. Games - eg playing \"who am i\"/\"21 questions\" in a chat;",

      "23/Aug/12 10:04 PM;712020:52ca7f73-55a8-444d-9ac3-f127f1575049;Firstly, the idea of the student messaging the teacher who then posts on the student's behalf is messy and is likely to delay feedback and slow down group interaction because we allow feedback on posted questions to come from any online teacher or student. Also, the student may not want the teacher to know who is asking the question, both because of embarrassment but also possibly because of a fear that an impression created by the question may affect future grading.\n\nSecondly, I think the idea of a more generic solution as proposed by Shane is a good idea given the variety of situations in which this facility could be used.\n\nFinally, I think we need to be careful about defining social constructivist approaches too narrowly. Constructivism is a broad approach to pedagogy that in my view supports approaches to encouraging student-initiated interaction with teachers and other students, which will play a part in constructing the knowledge of all. In some situations, allowing anonymous interaction allows better, more detailed, less inhibited interaction which increases the rate of knowledge growth. We need to recognise that many things may discourage interaction when no anonymity is permitted. Consider those interacting in a second or third language, gender or ethnic minorities, complex social relationships within a class, students with special needs - all of whom many benefit in their learning by allowing anonymity at times. This is very true in a high school setting but is also true in many other settings where the status quo social power balance may need addressing in the interests of equity.",

One example of how our teachers would like to use an anonymous forum is in an online, peer tutoring environment.  The teacher would like to have students in need of help post math problems with which they need help, and enable the peer tutors (quasi-teachers from a Moodle point of view) answer the questions.  The teacher feels that students will be more inclined to post freely and frequently without having to identify themselves as students who need (sometimes substantial amounts of) extra help.  In our scenario, I think it'd be best if the teacher could create a forum that permits but does not force anonymous posting, and when the student posts he has the opportunity to check a checkbox to make his individual post anonymous.  Or, taking it one step further, maybe the teacher can choose whether or not to force anonymous posting in this forum, in the event that the teacher wants all posts to be anonymous.",

In Germany (and also in some other countries) there is quite much concern about privacy and we experienced that students are much more willing to express their opinion freely if they can be sure that the posting is published totally anonymously.\r\n\r\nAt University of Duisburg-Essen we have created a modified version of the forum activity that provides an anonymity option. If this option is active, postings created by students are not posted by the student's name but by an anonymous pseudo-user account (similar to Juan Leyva's solution), whereas postings created by teachers are still posted by the teacher's name. As there is no possibility to find out which user exactly created a posting, this solution provides strong anonymity and thus can also be used in situations where strong privacy is required by law.\r\n\r\n@all: we might also publish the code if you are interested.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nNils",

Suggesting that Moodle is truly capable of this is a dangerous statement as Moodle is not able to influence things like server logging as I've discussed before.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is possible to obfuscate the user when they post by associating the post with a false user record, it _cannot_ be described as having been `{{totally anonymously}}` posted. If nothing else, it is possible for a teacher to view the course logs of when a student starts to access the course as a whole and then to associate a real user with a fake user.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in the pedagogical reasons for this, and why the proposed disguises solution does not suit. One of the features of the user disguises was the ability for the disguise settings to be locked in such a way that only the administrator can unlock the disguise and/or make changes. Combined with anonymous logging, and disabling the gradebook, it would be extremely difficult for a tutor to view the identity of a user _without_ administrator assistance. Unless I'm very much mistaken, this places you in the same place that you are in now - course logs are enabled, an administrator can determine the true identity, but a standard teacher cannot.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to support the `{{strong privacy is required by law}}` requirement you mention, I would strongly advise that you do not claim this unless you have disabled all user logging, including at the network, and the web server levels. Even then, I would be hesitant as it would still be feasible for identities to be divulged.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nAndrew",

Although this approach works, the limitation is that it is very difficult to determine inheritance from other contexts without giving some values special meaning, or simply ignoring them.\r\n\r\nOur proposed alternate solution was to instead use a new table (context_disguises or similar) and create a manager class (core_disguise in lib/classes/disguise.php I propose) to handle fetching of the disguises. This way we disjoint the disguises from the contexts, which makes future management easier (because changing the context table is hard, and potentially dangerous).\r\n\r\nI can't quite recall what we decided about how a disguise would, or would not, apply within an inheritance. I think the idea was:\r\n# if a disguise is applied at a parent context, a new disguise cannot be applied to any child context;\r\n# where a child context already has a disguise, that item can be modified, but not enabled/disabled (because the user identities would change).\r\n\r\nThere is still a lot of work to be done here, namely:\r\n# changing the work I've done already to fit this new data structure;\r\n# update all calls to fullname() and friends (starting with the forum);\r\n# add a plugin_supports() constant for disgusies\r\n# update unit tests;\r\n# write some templates.",

Our interest in anonymous posting is so that the students remain anonymous from each other, and have the freedom to ask questions without fearing ridicule. We are considering using it for peer-help forums. At the secondary education level, we would not be able to implement this feature, however, if there were 100% anonymity: meaning that the user's identity were not being logged in the back-end tables, so that at the very least a system administrator could query the tables and determine he identity of a potentially offensive poster, even if the teacher or a Moodle Site Administrator could never determine the identity through the front end. Please note that this is how an \"anonymous\" feedback activity presently works: (respondents' userids) are logged to a back-end table, even if the activity is set to anonymous.\r\n\r\nJoe",

In terms of most of the discussion, anonymous was supposed to be just that.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, you want students to be able to ask questions online, to have no-one know who they are (except the administrator/tutor) and for there to be pre-moderation.  The reasons you need this may be very sad, and possibly counter a good environment for learning - but there is is.\r\n\r\nYou guys and Gareth probably are at the moment posting at cross purposes with different presuppositions and assumptions.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest setting up an email within the policy guidelines of the institution (ie gmail or @yourplace.edu), and have an \"email a question\" link to it in Moodle.  Spell out the reasons for it in an inviting and positive way.  Don't hint at the negative environment you may feel.  Then the questions arrive, the tutor sanitises, bowdlerises or tidies them up and posts them with an answer in the forums.\r\n\r\nProblem solved.\r\n\r\n-Derek",

We need to remember that Moodle has a wide variety of audiences, and one size doesn't always fit all.

It also allows this to be applied to any part of Moodle, so you could have all quizzes, workshop activities, and forums disguised in this fashion.\n\nNote: the specification that I've written also suggests renaming this feature to disguises as there is no way in which Moodle can actually implement true anonymity. There is always some form of log, even if it isn't within Moodles control.\n\nAndrew",

For our purposes, we're not looking to moderate (get in the middle of) the anonymous questions posted by students.  We would not want to have to receive them by e-mail, then review each one and post them ourselves.  This would severely hinder the type of open, fast communication we'd want between our students.  Again, it's likely different for adult learners, but for teenagers we will always need a way to identify who's doing what on our systems.  At the secondary education level, at least in the US, academic freedom does not trump the need for the institution to monitor and guide student behavior, intervening when necessary.\r\n\r\nI fear this may be a moot point.  If the feature gets implemented as broadly as Andrew is describing wherein \"disguising\" could be applied to any number of Moodle activities (which I think would be nice), given the way the various activities store their data on the back-end, they will likely store the userid.  I don't see that as a problem.  As Andrew pointed out there's little, if anything, on the Internet that's truly anonymous.  We as systems administrators know that oftentimes the back-end of the system will tell us more than what even an administrative user will see in the front-end.\r\n\r\nThanks for engaging this topic.  I'm glad to see we have some more conversation taking place.\r\n\r\nJoe",

A number have also seen that total anonymity is very difficult to achieve if someone has access to Moodle logs and / or server logs. There are however, a number of situations where the ability to post anonymously is desirable, for example, discussing personal life experiences.  I think that for many people, their expectations of being anonymous will be that the other people in their course (with whatever role) will not be able to identify who made a post.  They may be less aware that at some stage a system admin could identify who made a post.  Joe also mentioned anonymity between class members but not from the teacher.  This is a different level of anonymity which is useful in some situations. Having graded levels of anonymity or privacy may be the best solution, however I would be loathe to see the ideal of a workable complete anonymity in forums compromised if the solution had to be one or the other (complete or partial).\r\n\r\nSome further comments: I think that for 'complete' anonymity it should not be easy for a sysadmin to identify people who posted and it should be impossible for a teacher to do so. If people are uncomfortable with that level of trust in their classes then they don't need to enable the feature. ",

It may already be the case in some jurisdictions that a court order would be required to legally access such information.\r\n\r\nIn a previous version of anonymous posting in forums, a teacher could select to make posters to the forum anonymous.  After content had been posted the teacher could then untick the anonymous option and everyone's names became visible for all participants.  This is quite a grave infringement of privacy and trust.  The proposal that lead to this discussion was that forums should have a properly anonymous option. As was then discussed, there is no true anonymity in the system if users have at some point logged in to access their courses. That is why I am suggesting that we accept that and move to a compromise position where anonymity is effectively in place although sysadmins could track down with reasonable certainty who an individual poster was. I think that allowing sysadmins the ability to query a post and immediately see the real identity of the poster is too easy and may be subject in some instances to abuse, perhaps through peer pressure from teachers, (and also in some small installations some teachers will have sysadmin rights).\r\n\r\nIt should be clear that the normal use of a forum will continue as it is at the moment. Making posters anonymous will be the choice of whoever controls the course where the forum exists.

      "25/Feb/16 7:35 PM;5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b;Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm going to put this issue up for peer review today to get some feedback on the way in which I have implemented this at a core level.\r\n\r\nThis change been implemented as per the [specification I posted last year|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z6LSKlNj0OD-1V6xL-CmRvQ6weG-6MwPXmszaU5vO14/edit] and is close to feature completion.\r\n\r\nAs previously discussed I have renamed this feature to 'User disguises' to reflect the true nature of it and the fact that true anonymity is close to impossible.\r\n\r\nh5. State\r\nDisguises has been architected as a plugin-based design where disguise plugins dictate:\r\n* how display names are calculated for display;\r\n* the URL used for the profile page (if one is set at all);\r\n* the URL used for the user_picture (if one is set at all); and\r\n* the URL used for user messagign (if one is set at all).\r\n\r\nThe original feature request here was for mod_forum to support anonymity, but I felt early on in the design stage that this functionality really should be available to other areas too. Given the pedagogical use-cases for this feature, I feel that it is potentially suited for any interaction between students (e.g. mod_chat, mod_wiki, mod_workshop, block_comments). As a result disguises are implemented directly within the context.\r\n\r\nh5. Features\r\nThe following features have been implemented:\r\n# Ability to select from a range of disguise types (new plugin type)\r\n# Ability to enable/disable the disguise entirely\r\n# Ability to determine which users can see the true identity of disguised users:\r\n## Teachers, Editing teachers, and Managers (by default) have a capability which will allow them to reveal identity if the disguise has been configured to reveal identity to some users.\r\n## Manager (by default) has a capability to reveal identites at any time.\r\n# Ability to reveal true identities from a specific time/date\r\n# Support for 'anonymous' logging of the events system\r\n# Plugin archtecture with two plugins\r\n# Hooked into navigation/settings navigation\r\n# Hook into $PAGE to ensure that the current user is configured (and allow redirect to a plugin-specific configuration page).\r\n# Works in Moodle Mobile application with minimal change required in the app\r\n# Applied to mod_forum\r\n# May be applied to any module\r\n# Ability for a disguise configuration to be 'locked' so that disguise revelation settings cannot be altered. This can be unlocked by the administrator (capability based).\r\n\r\nh6. Plugins\r\nI have created two plugins at this time:\r\n# disguise_basic: Teacher defines a single value which is used for all users. No profile links, message links, or user pictures are displayed\r\n# disguise_predefined: Teacher defines a set of possible names which are allocated randomly on a first-come, first-served basis. No profile links, message links, or user pictures are displayed.\r\n\r\nI would like to create some additional plugins, but these will probably happen after this issue is integrated:\r\n# disguise_userdefined: User may choose their own pseudonym. No profile links, or message links. User may choose a custom user picture.\r\n# disguise_role: Teacher defines a set of roles, similar to disguise_predefined. Custom profile links (to support role backstories). Teacher may define a custom user picture.\r\n\r\nh5. Performance\r\nBecause they are implemented at \\context, and all uses of the context SQL helpers have been updated accordingly, there should be no increase in the number of DB reads when a disguise is disabled.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the disguise is loaded into the context so subsequent calls to {{$context->disguise}} will not increase operations significantly.\r\n\r\nWhen a disguise is _enabled_ there will be one additional DB read to fetch the disguise configuration, and then additional reads (and potentially writes) may be required depending on the disguise in question.\r\n\r\nIn the plugins I have written:\r\n* disguise_basic should not cause any additional DB reads or writes as all configuration is held within the disguise itself.\r\n* disguise_predefined will lead to one additional DB read to fetch the disguise mappings for all defined names, and one write per user as the disguise is first applied.\r\n\r\nh5. Outstanding items\r\nAlthough the feature is near completion, there are still a few outstanding issues to resolve:\r\n# Improve $OUTPUT->user_picture() to allow specification of custom URLs\r\nThis will allow disguises to have custom pictures for each disguise - potentially very useful for role play situations.\r\n# Standardise user picture display in mobile app In some parts of the mobile app the user picture URL is manually calculated using the userid and the userpicture. This happens in the forum and needs to be updated for the previous item to work in the mobile app.\r\n# Finish the admin UI for disguise_predefined\r\n# Developer documentation\r\n# Functional and Unit tests\r\nI'll be starting on these soon\r\n# Backup\r\n## The context needs to be extended to include disguise\r\n## The disguise needs to be backed up\r\n## All disguises need to backup both their configuration, and their data\r\n## We need to consider as to whether it should be possible to back up a disguised context if the disguise is locked and the user performing the backup cannot reveal identities.\r\n# Extend to other contexts (e.g. block)\r\n\r\nh5.

      "23/Mar/16 1:54 AM;62a17dfe954f50006fccd2b6;Hey Andrew, this is really cool, nice work.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I'm sorry I haven't finished this review yet. It's a lot to get through. I'm going to leave my notes so far for you to look at and continue reviewing this asap.\r\n\r\n# I got this error when creating the forum in step 1.2{code}Argument 1 passed to core\\disguise\\helper::add_to_form() must be an instance of moodleform, instance of MoodleQuickForm given, called in [dirroot]/course/moodleform_mod.php on line 534{code} I \"fixed\" it by removing the {{mform}} type hint on {{add_to_form}} but I think it requires more consideration.\r\n# Related, why do we pass {{$mform}} by reference? I see it all over moodle (maybe in older, pre-PHP 5 parts it makes sense), but here there's no need to pass a reference to the object's identifier (related: #10).\r\n# [This|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/7adc7ef...MDL-1071-master#diff-1ccce8da2cb232c82c02d6e3cf9c85e5R289] will give an undefined variable notice. Can we not just do {code:php}    final public function can_toggle_real_identity() {\r\n        if (has_capability('moodle/disguise:revealidentity', $this->context)) {\r\n            // This user holds the revealidentity capability, therefore they are able to toggle identity display.\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return $this->showrealidentity === helper::IDENTITY_RESTRICTED && \r\n                has_capability('moodle/disguise:showidentity', $this->context);\r\n    }{code}\r\n# I notice than when viewing the forum, my username in the top right changes to 'Anonymous' - is that really needed? Could it be confusing? I get that maybe it's supposed to let the user know they're posting anonymously but maybe there's a better way to do that?\r\n# In step 2.1.1 I didn't get an error, I simply got a blank white page (related: step 1.6.1 probably needs to say something like \"don't add the animals set\" - I was stupid and added it which made the forum work just fine).\r\n# Step 5.3.1 failed for me because of the {{$showidentity}} problem I mentioned earlier (after fixing it, it works fine).\r\n# I checked how forum digest emails look, and it seems to work without revealing who posted what, but I noticed the username \"Anonymous\" is still a link ({{<a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Anonymous</a>}}) is it possible to make it just text?\r\n# Small typo in animal set: \"Anonymous Panthers\" - should be \"Anonymous Panther\".\r\n# Can we change [this|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/7adc7ef...MDL-1071-master#diff-9b2de23daa1efd203cac9cc1fd5f972dR5267] to something like {code:php}$notenoughdata = empty($rec->ctxid)\r\n\t\t|| empty($rec->ctxlevel)\r\n\t\t|| !isset($rec->ctxinstance)\r\n\t\t|| empty($rec->ctxpath)\r\n\t\t|| empty($rec->ctxdepth);\r\n\t\t|| !isset($rec->ctxdisguiseid);{code}Personally I find it easier to look at. We could go as far as adding the whole thing to the {{if}} conditional instead of introducing a new variable.\r\n# I know you didn't write it, but [this|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/7adc7ef...MDL-1071-master#diff-9b2de23daa1efd203cac9cc1fd5f972dR5281] comment is [wrong|http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.references.php]. In PHP what gets passed around is an object _identifier_, (and you can even have a reference to the identifier). It would be nice to fix the comment.\r\n# I don't particularly like [this|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/7adc7ef...MDL-1071-master#diff-1ccce8da2cb232c82c02d6e3cf9c85e5R121] - in a method called {{get_config}} I wouldn't expect {{config}} to get set. Surely that is better dealt with in the constructor. Is there anything wrong with using {{$this->config = (object)json_decode($record->configdata);}} in the constructor? I like that better, given the other casts there, adding defaults can be handled there too.\r\n#* Side note: Maybe there is a good reason, but I don't get why I see objects being used for key-value pairs so much in moodle. Why can't we just use PHP's \"arrays\"? (actually PHP's arrays are hash tables, as are objects), then the whole thing becomes nicer IMO:{code:php}class myClass {\r\n\tprotected $config = array(\r\n\t\t'disguiseuseras' => 'basic',\r\n\t);\r\n\t\t\r\n\tpublic function __construct(array $config = array()) {\r\n\t\t$this->config = array_merge($this->config, $config); //$config clobbers $this->config\r\n\t}\r\n}{code}\r\n# What is [this|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/7adc7ef...MDL-1071-master#diff-1ccce8da2cb232c82c02d6e3cf9c85e5R146] for? I like fluid interfaces and method chaining a lot, but this class doesn't appear to implement that.\r\n#* Side note: The docblock for this method appears incorrect.\r\n# Can we use {{is_null}} [here|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/7adc7ef...MDL-1071-master#diff-1ccce8da2cb232c82c02d6e3cf9c85e5R182]\r\n# [This|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/7adc7ef...MDL-1071-master#diff-1ccce8da2cb232c82c02d6e3cf9c85e5R186] comment strikes me as strange since we are not checking anything.\r\n# [This|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/7adc7ef...MDL-1071-master#diff-1ccce8da2cb232c82c02d6e3cf9c85e5R226] method is a bit strange to me. I think the name is mostly what I find unusual. It's called \"handle_user...\" yet it doesn't seem to do anything with a user.",
      "23/Mar/16 3:21 AM;5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b;Thanks Cameron,\r\n\r\n1) Fixed\r\n2) I suspect that this is habit. It's a complex object so it will be passed by reference naturally.\r\n3) Fixed. We _could_ do that, but I find it clearer and easier to read as I've written it. Also, my way complies with coding style whilst yours does not (as I recall).\r\n4) This is partially because I have not been through the entire site and changed it to use \\core\\user::fullname() and passing it the context. It's also partially because I feel that it improves the user experience - the user can see that they are currently wearing their disguise and there is less of a question as to whether it will be preserved everywhere.\r\n5) This isn't written yet.\r\n6) Fixed in (2)\r\n7) Remember this is a Proof of concept. The code is not yet finished and some of this is likely to take place in the later stages, possibly after integration. This is a massive feature and there's just no way that every possibility can be caught.\r\nWe may need to consider adjusting several of the templates - this is one, but I'm not going to do them immediately as we need to think about this.\r\n8) Fixed.\r\n9) Again, we could... but my way complies with coding style. Also, personally I prefer it and find it easier to read. Horses for courses.\r\n10) Fixed - but not really relevant to this issue\r\n11) It doesn't set the config. $this->config is a converted version of the actual config. It isn't the version from the DB - that is configdata.\r\nWe just init the the view of it if $this->config is falsy - this will happen if the configdata field (from the DB) is null:\r\n{code}\r\nvar_dump(json_decode(null));\r\n{code}\r\nThe default value is set in the constructor already.\r\n12) How does it 'not' implement method chaining? That is precisely what it is for.\r\n13) Why? There is no benefit, and if anything is_null() has added overheads so is (very marginally) less efficient.\r\n14) Fixed. this was historical. Now the plugin is expected to override the function (and probably call parent:: on it). Originally this was not the design.\r\n15) Why? It's handling the user now being configured.\r\nUnfortunately I don't think that there is an example of this yet, but essentially it's the opposite of handle_unconfigured_for_user().\r\nhandle_unconfigured_for_user() grabs the current URL and stores it in the session, then redirects to the user_configuration_path().\r\nWhen the user is now configured, the script at user_configuration_path should call handle_user_now_configured() to redirect the user back to their previous location.\r\n\r\nPushed with the above updates.",
      "23/Mar/16 11:03 PM;60ca243120d2dd0070c77e82;Hi Andrew,\r\nI started looking at this branch too, here are couple of comments (more will follow tomorrow):\r\n1. There are quite a few \"TODO\"s left in code\r\n2. In inplace-editable you do not always set the context - try pulling MDL-53274 and testing with it. \r\n3. It caught my eye that the table name is in plural 'disguises' where everything else (component name, plugin type) is singular - 'disguise'. But I don't think we have any strict policy about it and existing db tables are a big mix\r\n4. mustache file does not have all docs (it will not be accessible from templates library), also there are lots of phpdocs missing \r\n5. I'm a little confused about argument $override in the fullname() function - I was pretty sure it meant that current user has capability to view fullnames, not the first-then-last format.",
      "23/Mar/16 11:25 PM;62a17dfe954f50006fccd2b6;I want to preface the rest of this review by saying that generally I like your approach. Although I don't feel confident I am the most qualified person to pass judgment on what is \"good\" in moodle. As best I can tell, based on the constraints, your solution is great. I like how generic it is, and the fact that it can be applied to so many parts of moodle is excellent. So in that regard, this patch is awesome and you've done a great job. The way the disguises are implemented within a context is a bit tricky for me to get my head around (more about that bellow), but I quite like the way forms get passed to the helper to have the extra stuff added - that's probably what I would do if I had to make something like this. All in all, it was genuinely quite easy for me to understand the concept and how it worked - I know some people are not sold on the name \"disguises\" but for me personally, I like it, and it reflects the nature of the feature well.\r\n\r\nI want to reiterate that it's hard for me to say for sure how good of an idea all this stuff is; because my experience with moodle is still very limited, and I can't help but think about solving this problem in a completely different way, in a completely different context (common OOP design patterns frequently spring to mind). This review has been a big learning experience for me.\r\n\r\nI probably don't know enough about it, but something that I found unusual was that the context has an identifier for the disguise, and the disguise also has an identifier for the context. It makes sense to me that one would need to know about the other, but I'm not sure I see them both needing to be aware of each other like that, it makes the whole thing feel really circular and weird, because now we have these two objects messing with each others' state.  Things like a manager class start springing to mind but I don't think I have an intimate enough knowledge of the situation to properly comment. In some cases it seems like the disguise is needlessly passing information back to the context, when we could just use the context as an aggregate root to drill down to the disguise (or something like that...). *Edit:* After looking at it a bit more I think I get what's going on, but my point about it being a bit confusing still stands (although maybe a moodle master wouldn't have the problems I had :])\r\n\r\nAnother thing I don't really like that much is that we have to add more stuff to the user class; but I suppose given the way the {{core_user}} class is designed, there isn't really another way is there? I would much rather see things like composition or decoration, but it doesn't seem doable :[\r\n\r\nIn response to your previous comment, for brevity I'll just comment on your responses that I don't fully agree with.\r\n\r\n3 and 9. There's this from the coding style guide:{quote}Wrapping lines\r\n\r\nWhen wrapping a line, indent the follow-on line by 8 spaces rather than 4. For example:\r\n{code}\r\nif (a_long_condition() &&\r\n        a_nother_long_condition()) {\r\n    do_something();\r\n}{code}{quote} which is sort of similar to what I'm saying. However as you say, different strokes. It's your patch and if you want to keep it that way that's fine by me :]\r\n\r\n11. Sure, but it still feels wrong to have that logic in {{get_config}}. You say the default value is set in the constructor, but I disagree. To me, the default value is what you get out of {{get_config}} when it's called and {{$record->configdata}} is falsy (i.e., the default is an object with one member, 'disguiseuseras' which has the value 'disguise_basic'). I really feel like what's happening is not obvious the way it's currently written, and it should be done in the constructor. Is there any reason why we can't do something similar to my example?\r\n\r\n12. What I meant was, why has it only been implemented on that one method? This class doesn't appear to lend itself well to method chaining, so maybe it shouldn't be on that method at all? Also the docblock is still incorrect.\r\n\r\nContinuing with the review. These are all minor things from my POV, as I said before the approach you have taken here is great. However I'd still like to raise these points because I like to talk about the finer details of these sort of things.\r\n\r\n# [Typo|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/fed66ad...MDL-1071-master#diff-1ccce8da2cb232c82c02d6e3cf9c85e5R363]? Should it be \"Use @link disguise_displayname instead\"?\r\n# [Here|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/fed66ad...MDL-1071-master#diff-ddcb995684410ce015a82aea8ab4330fR459] (and other places), as best I can tell, we can just do {code}$displayoptions['context']->disguise->displayname($user, $displayoptions);{code} (In PHP7 call_user_func_array is [basically equivalent |https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/zend_compile.c#L3540] to a normal function call, so it's desirable to just use a normal function call IMO). In this particular instance the method name and arguments are known; so I don't think there is an advantage to using call_user_func_array.\r\n# Why [get_called_class|https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/compare/fed66ad...MDL-1071-master#diff-1ccce8da2cb232c82c02d6e3cf9c85e5R553]? Really that's for late static binding jazz, which isn't applicable here. Can we use {{get_class($this)}}? Functionally it should be no different, it just reflects the way the class is intended to be used better imo.\r\n\r\nI think that mostly covers the meat of this patch... The rest of it seems to be going around to all the places in moodle that need to use this new feature.\r\n\r\nGreat job, ending my review here.",

      "24/Mar/16 9:46 PM;60ca243120d2dd0070c77e82;I love what you are doing with the core_user class - we needed these function for a long time! Just to record here what we discussed in jabber - would be great to have $context as a separate argument to all the new functions that you added in core_user class - this way the developers will pay more attention to it and forget less often. This is the problem with current format_string() function.\r\nAlso 'firstthenlast' should be renamed to something like 'viewfullnames' or 'override' and the use of it discouraged - passing context is sufficient to check the capability. However refactoring the whole moodle may be outside of the scope here.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that is often forgotten when introducing new plugin type - the string is missing for the \"disguise\" plugin type  (see plugins overview) and also it is not possible to uninstall disguise plugin types.\r\n\r\nI hope we are not abusing the \"context\" table by adding new field to it. Can we be 100% sure we will never want several disguises applied to one context (having another additional condition)? Can several records in context table have the same disguiseid?",
      "24/Mar/16 10:55 PM;5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b;Hi Both,\n\nThank you for your reviews:\n\nh5. Marina's comments:\n\n1) Yes... as mentioned [here|https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-1071?focusedCommentId=380620&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel] I was hoping for a review of how this is implemented at the core level. It is incomplete at the moment and there are a number of outstanding items\nI was hoping to get help from HQ to finish off the remaining TODOs and items.\n2) Will check those - any in particular? I don't see a way to specify a contextid to the inplace editable...\n3) They are instances of disguises. Most of our tables are plural (forum_posts, assign_grades, block_instnaces, book_chapters, mdl_events_handlers, mdl_external_services, mdl_grade_grades, mdl_grade_categories, mdl_files, mdl_message_processors, mdl_question_answers, mdl_tool_monitor_rules) Only really old things are singular on the whole, and module tables are enforced singular since the very early days.\n4) See 1 - I haven't finished writing the docs\n5) As discussed in chat, I've adjusted all of these functions to take $context as a first-class argument, and to rename firsthenlast to usefullnamedisplay. {{$override}} is very misleading IMO. \n\nh5. Cameron:\n\nI wasn't aware that disgusies was contentious 😉 Anyway...\n\nSo with the context <--> disguise thing the important part to remember is that one disguise may be implemented in multiple contexts - they're a many-to-one relationship.\n\nThis feature is currently not implemented in the UI, but I can see it being particularly useful in the future for certain things.\nOne example I have had in mind:Â we don't have a context for course categories but you may wish to apply the same disguise to a forum, a workshop, and a wiki all at the same time.\n\nBecause of the way in which contexts work, I opted to keep the disguise such that it is generally only aware of a single context - when calling fullname and friends, we can only deal with one context - it isn't possible to consider multiple languages when returning strings.\n\nGenerally speaking the context needs to be aware of the disguise always, so this relationship makes sense. The disguise needs to be aware of the context too, but because of the many-to-one mapping we need to store the current context of note.\n\nI'm not sure that a manager class would add anything here - I did consider it but rejected it much earlier on.\n\nI would _love_ to decorate a true user, but we simply don't have one. It's well beyond the scope of this issue to create one and if this issue were to depend on that change it would likely be many years off because the importance of such a change is low and the risk is high.\n\nWith regards points 3/9:\n[https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Coding_style#Wrapping_Control_Structures|https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Coding_style#Wrapping_Control_Structures]\n\nI prefer my way and find it much easier to read. It's clearer where the test is, it's easier to add additional components to the test if required, and each can be individually documented more easily.\n\n11) In your example you are setting a protected value in the class, but it's not possible to make function calls in the class itself, e.g.:\n\n{code:java}class myClass {\r\n  protected $config = [\r\n    'disguiseuseras' => get_string('anonymous', 'disguise_basic'),\r\n  ];\r\n}{code}\n\nThat said, the config in particular belongs to the disguise_basic plugin and is just in the wrong place. I've adjusted it now and moved the config initialisation to the constructor as you suggest.\n\n12) Well, this is the only setter. Every other method in the function is some form of getter, or it does not make sense to do so. I have just added it to set_show_real_identity_state() too.\n\n13.1) Yup - fixed\n13.2) Okay - Adjusted.\n13.3) Probably because get_class() returns \\core\\disguise\\disguise whilst get_called_class() returns \\disguise_basic\\disguise - which is what we want.\nTechnically we only want the namespace of the late static class, but there is no way of getting this.\n\nh5. Marina\n\nYup - I am aware of redirect_if_major_upgrade_required(). Have now adjusted it, but I'm not aware of a 'good' way of  supressing those errors all the time. Unfortunately that function does not do a good enough job yet anyway - if you visit various other pages, they will not force the upgrade.\n\nWe could suppress it during initial install and/or upgrade? (I've just made this change).",

It's already a massive form. Maybe some of the other settings could be changed on the configure disguises page.\r\n\r\n\"Names to add\" I tried to add a list of names separated by commas and it didn't work. \r\n\r\nThe \"Display format of user disguises\" setting should be less prominent IMO. \r\n\r\nThe page with 2 separate forms needs a redesign. \r\n\r\nI chose Countries from the admin names list to see what it does. It immediately imported 250 countries to my module with no undo. \r\n\r\nI feel it more likely for a teacher to have their own preferred list of names, than for a site administrator to come up with a useful list. It just seems more like something related to personal teaching styles than something that should be dictated centrally. \r\n\r\nI don't really like how this completely replaces the user info in the header. I am not logged in as \"Turkmenistan\" - I am using disguise for the current module. It should IMO display my real name and could optionally show the disguise name (similar to \"You are logged in as\"). If I am using the logged in as feature it shows the names of both users disguises in the current module - which is confusing. \r\n\r\nLets get this feature supported in more places when it's released. Chat seems like another useful place. \r\n\r\nI get no logging with this feature enabled. \r\n\r\nThe default list of country names are all in English. \"Japan\" is not \"Japan\" in Japanese.\r\n\r\n\"Display format of user disguises\" seems to be called \"Wrapper\" in the admin settings. I think this is the same field.\r\n\r\nDo the set names support multilang ?\r\n\r\nThats all for now - the code in this feature is really good - thanks for your hard work on it. Lets perfect it and release it in an awesome state for 3.2. \r\n\r\nCheers!",

CLAMP's anonymous forum feature works in this way:\r\n * It creates a new user called \"Anonymous User\", who is not actually enrolled in courses\r\n * It adds a setting to forums letting the teacher choose whether posts are never, always, or sometimes anonymous (allowing the poster to choose)\r\n * Forum posts that are anonymous are owned by the Anonymous User in the database instead of the actual poster, but there is an additional field in the database storing the \"real\" userid to permit editing of the post after the fact.\r\n\r\nFrom our perspective, the benefit of this approach is that inadvertent disclosure of the real poster is very unlikely. The current implementation has been continuously maintained since 2010 and notwithstanding a few bumps with the most recent mod_forum refactoring, it's been stable and useful at our member institutions.",

A lot of our request is around anonymity for the students to not feel that they would get \"picked on\" by their peers by asking a \"dumb\" question.\r\n\r\nWe also have (generally) taken the view that true anonymity is not necessary in a number of cases, and in scenarios where true anonymity could be used to do harmful things then there isn't always a case for it.\r\n\r\nIn simply not displaying authors, and making no futher changes to Moodle's current handling (i.e. the posts *are* actually identifiable) then it sort of satisfies both cases. The patch I was playing with does this via the capability system, rather than via an activity setting, the case being that once set up is is *much* harder for a typical user to un-setup the anonymity, but if necessary it can be reversed by an appropriate user (i.e. admin). (caveat this is of course if very much dependant on how much control you permit different roles to have over the re-configuration of capabilities at different contexts, we don't allow much of this).",

I have found at the uni where I work that teachers like to name things but most will quickly revert to week1, week2 etc. so that seems quite adequate.\n\nThe title of the first activity/resource, as it appears now, seems a good default name (without repeating it in the bread crumbs)\n\nMy view of a (bread)crumb trail is the path you have been on, not an indication of the current location in the structure (which is a useful thing), though this would be a challange to program given the flexible navigation available.\n\nTo my fairly new look at Moodle there seems to be a few areas, eg. Reports/Logs, where the navigation is mixed with the crumb trail concept - so viewing a log from another course puts a 'crumb' for that course in the trail, although being able to navigate directly to the new course is a great feature it's not what I expected, I'd like to get back to where I was without reversing my browser (far too many sites where the back btn is essential) or viewing another log from the course I was working on.\n\nMal.

However I am pretty sure you could do it by making small changes to the build_navigation function within lib/weblib.php.

    "Description": "On installation, I accept the default method (using PHP) for email. Admin user is set up and everything is running okay. Logged in and created a new user account (teacher1), and was told email was sent. No email arrived. Logged in as admin, listed users, and it says Displaying Users 0 to 3. It lists only two users, admin and a blank account. If the new user (teacher1) tries to log in, he is told that he needs to use the email directions. As admin in 1.1.1, I was able to delete this user in this case. As admin now I cannot even see this user.\n\n\n\nOf course, I've added an smtp server, and all is well, except that Teacher1 can not be removed... It would be nice to have an option to resend the email.",

    "Description": "When an activity is hidden, the events that it has created should be hidden as well.\n\n\n\nWhen a coursemodule instance is hidden or unhidden, Moodle should set or unset a hidden flag in a ishidden field of the event table for all the corresponding events. This will be easy to do because luckily the event table has 'modulename' and 'instance' fields. Thus the events corresponding to a coursemodule id will be easy to find. \n\n\n\nThe calendar should be modified so that events with the hidden flag set are only shown to a restricted set of people. Thus hidden course and group events should only be shown to teachers, and hidden user events only to the user who created them.",

Should there be modification so the user links are not on the main site page if $CFG->hidesiteprofiles is true?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  22 March 2004, 01:59 PM:\n\nActually, how about this, much simpler:\n\n\n\nif ($course->category or $CFG->hidesiteprofiles) {\n\n   require_login($course->id);\n\n}\n\n\n\nThat way they just get asked to log in if they try and look at the user profiles ...\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  22 March 2004, 03:50 PM:\n\nI would prefer that the page simply checks that the user requested is in the course specified. That way I as admin can still make some profiles available to the outside world by enroling the user in course 1. For example the profiles of anyone able to post on the site news forum would still be visible.\n\n\n\nThus I would simplify \n\n\n\nif ($course->category and ! isguest() ) {\n\n        if (!isstudent($course->id, $user->id) && !isteacher($course->id, $user->id)) {\n\n            print_heading(get_string(notenrolled, , $fullname));\n\n            print_footer($course);\n\n            die;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\n\nby taking out the\n\n\n\nif ($course->category and ! isguest() ) { }\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Tuesday, 4 May 2004, 01:13 AM:\n\nClosed, since Martin has implemented $CFG->forceloginforprofiles",

Since there doesn't seem to be a bug filed for this yet, I'll hijack this one and rename it.\n\n\n\nInstant messaging is a bit like Dialogue module, except:\n\n\n\n  - it is a standard GUI feature on every course \n\n  - there are options to forward messages to email or  external IM services\n\n  - a slim popup window can be activated, it works much like a traditional IM, with sending, receiving, live chat etc\n\n  - accessing a Moodle page will cause a check for new messages and will activate the popup if necessary\n\n\n\nI'm thinking of using one of the many Jabber-based projects as the infrastructure - this should allow the internal messaging system to be hooked up with external ones (Yahoo, ICQ, etc)\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Thursday,  25 March 2004, 09:28 PM:\n\nSounds good... its a bit like what Unix has had for ever... you have new mail etc. when logging on.\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Friday,  26 March 2004, 06:17 PM:\n\nmaybe I've slightly missed the point - however the GPL Jabber servers are all (AFAIK) writted in C - at least 'jabered' is and I think that's what everybody uses. I was under the impression that you had made the decision to only use PHP code in Moodle. I have used jabered myself and it isn't all that easy to use either.\n\n\n\nIn any case, is the Instant Messenger function really that much different from the existing Chat function? It would need some modification to allow a chat to keep going in the 'background' while you are doing something else - which would be more useful anyway.\n\n\n\nThis is not quite the same thing as my request, but thinking it through I suppose what I want may be acheived my a similar 'background' modification to dialogues.\n\n\n\nPerhaps what we want is a 'status' box on every Moodle page the says 'someone has left a Dialogue message for you' or 'someone is trying to Chat with you' etc etc. A kind of 'personal' and real-time recent activity. Now I think *that* would be a nice thing!!\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  26 March 2004, 08:43 PM:\n\nIt's like chat if people both have their windows open, but more like email if they don't (but all in the same interface).  And point 4 is pretty much the same thing as the status box you mention except it isn't constrained within the page (being a popup).\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Tuesday, 3 May 2005, 11:32 PM:\n\nI think messaging does indeed accomplish this function.

    "Description": "A start forum with all users subscribed would be great to have. Even better would be to combine this with an option for the instructor to add individual students to a forum in the same fashion the instructor can add students to a class, using the Students link.\n\n\n\nOne could go further yet, and allow the instructor a Force option so students put into a forum by the instructor cannot remove themselves from a forum.\n\n\n\nOptions like these would facilitate setting up group work, even with students participating in multiple groups. Such options are also very useful where moodle is used for Committee work: It would help a chair quickly set up sub-committees, for example.",

My suggestion is for the instructor to have an option to add members to a forum the way one adds students to a class. This way the instructor can add a subset of the class to a forum, and afterwards click a Force button that prevents this subset from unsubscribing.\n\n\n\nLars.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  16 August 2004, 05:33 AM:\n\nThis button was introduced in Moodle 1.3 but has just been removed again for 1.4 in favor of a more flexible subscription editing page.",

    "Description": "This is about a way of reviewing / commenting on a document.\n\n\n\nI tried using a web application last year, for discussion and document review, but stopped when it was blocked by our company firewall which blocks discussion board time sites with dire warnings...\n\n\n\nThe site is quicktopic.com they provide a free instant discussion area and a free document review system.  \n\n\n\nThis looks like a commercial venture however the document review system has some good ideas in it:\n\n\n\nFirstly, it is possible to upload a document prepared offline. \n\nDocuments are then split into sentences and a discussion list is associated with the document, with an entry available for each sentence.\n\nAt the start of the sentence there is an add comment icon, which allows users to add comments about the sentence.  If comments exist then it is possible to view them and add further comments.  Typically a comment could be used to suggest an alternate sentence or provide advice / feedback.\n\nLastly it is possible to view the document with the comments expanded in-line.\n\n\n\nMy Proposal:\n\n\n\nWhat I am suggesting here is a module that allows someone to create/post a document.\n\nAfter it is submitted, it is formatted / split into sentences with the option to allow the addition of comments on a per sentence basis. (These could be from tutors and / or students).  \n\nIf comments exist then an  icon or link appears by the sentence. \n\nTutors comments could be private / in another colour.\n\nComments could then be viewed by the student, either individually or as view of the document with the comments embedded.  (Export/download would be useful).\n\n\n\nBecause this is based on commenting on a document, then the best way of incorporating the comments in a new version would be to upload a revised draft for a fresh set of comments to be made.\n\ne.g.  one student would have the role of editor to incorporate the comments in the new revised draft.\n\n\n\nIf there is interest in this, then I can put together a more detailed specification /design  for someone to code.\n\n\n\nRoger",

If a null grade is entered for all ungraded items, it could be hyperlinked, so that clicking on it takes one directly to the item. Currently one must go to the header hyperlink, then find the user in question. This is very difficult with large sections of hundreds of students. BB implements this by putting in an ! when an assignment is submitted (and ungraded). Clicking on the ! takes the grader to the item, where they can submit a grade and return back to same place in the gradebook. There is no easy way to do this with large classes otherwise.",

We use that here in York. A student is penalized for each wrong attempt at a question. The amount of penalty is set by the teacher and is chosen to make sense for that particular question. In the case of a true-false question the penalty should always be equal to the full grade.\n\n\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 7 May 2005, 01:33 AM:\n\nYou can now switch off the display of scores in review.",

      "23/Nov/06 6:02 PM;712020:fa6e41d7-a4db-4444-adda-e7bc5e35c3fa;Here's a summary I wrote:\n\nMoodle iCalendar export summary\n\nThere are many cases where it would be useful for a user to be able to export events from their calendar in Moodle into a separate calendar program such as Evolution or Kontact. Many such programs also support subscribing to a remote calendar feed, in which case the program automatically downloads the latest version of the calendar at regular intervals.\n\nThe standard format for calender information is iCalendar, as defined by RFC 2445 (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html). This format is supported in varying degrees by Korganiser/Kontact, Evolution, Mozilla Calendar, Apple iCal, Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook.\n\nI have implemented support for Moodle to export calendars to iCalendar format, in such a way that subscription is possible as well as download. This support is based on a partial implementation by Jon Papaioannou, using his Bennu (http://bennu.sourceforge.net/) library.\n\nThis can be accessed by two links at the bottom of the calendar page (calendar/view.php). 'Quick download / subscribe to calendar' links straight to download all events (global events, user events for the logged-in user and course events for relevant courses) from the last 5 or next 60 days. The URL includes the username and does not require logging in in the usual manner, so that it can be subscribed to with calendar applications, which are of course unable to handle the usual login process. Instead, a reasonable measure of security is provided by the 'authtoken' parameter in the URL, which is a SHA-1 hash of the username concatenated with the password hash. The use of a hash means that should someone else get hold of the URL they cannot discover the user's password. The use of both username and password in generating the hash avoids the problem of discovering users with the same password. This basic approach was suggested by Martin Dougiamas in the forum thread at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=37393.\n\nThe 'Export calendar' link on the calendar page leads to a page where more options can be configured. The user can then either click 'Export' to download the calendar, or 'Get calendar URL' to be given the appropriate URL (generated by JavaScript) to copy to their calendar program to subscribe.\n\nThis form is handled by calendar/export.php and calendar/export_basic.php. The actual export process is handled by calendar/export_execute.php, with the help of Bennu.\n\nI have tested the exported file in Korganiser/Kontact, Evolution, Outlook, Google Calendar and Mozilla Calendar and it seems to work in all 5, though Mozilla Calendar doesn't handle the timezone quite right.\n",

Students can get several Assignment #1 or TEST notices from a teacher. Knowing what course it is for would be very helpful. In the discussion at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=35129 Jon provides a partial patch for this. The downside would be the extra queries involved to get the shortname; however, I think it is well worth it.\n\nRelated forum discussions:\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=63538\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=34551",

I'm undertaking the enormous task of going through all the items in the MDL backlog.\r\n\r\nThis is a highly-voted for feature, but this particular ticket hasn't seen much action recently -- and I suspect that this is because of the wonderful plugin that Isuru built, maintains, and has published on the directory.\r\n\r\nThis plugin is really widely-used and seems to be very actively maintained. At this stage, I'll mark this particular item as closed, because the plugin provides all the functionality that this ticket talks about and then some.\r\n\r\nThis in no way closes the door for core improvements in this area (or for bringing this plugin into core), but rather is a recognition of the fact that we won't be able to do so for the foreseeable future, and there's a magnificent solution that works brilliantly available in the plugin directory.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who's been involved in this ticket for the past 18 years (it's old enough to vote in most countries!), and particularly to [~accountid:557058:7904f2ce-ceac-4d86-96c4-d02a0293a6c4], who started work on this as a GSoC project!"

As they can have DB support, every block can potentially have everything they need stored in DB.\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure that we'll extend moodleblock class in the future, adding an edit (an other...) interfaces to it, sure!!\n\n\n\nPerhaps this bug can be now a good place to talk about what to extend... possibilities are really amazing!!\n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\n \n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Tuesday,  11 May 2004, 06:23 PM:\n\nI suggest that we first implement a configuration interface for the recent activity block, much like the one that exists for online_users. This would be global, from the admin interface. The reasoning is that traditionally, things in Moodle are configured hierarchically (in order of setting precedence): global config -> course config -> personal config.\n\n\n\nThus, since having a course settings interface under this scheme would mean making a dominant clone of it for the site administration, I think we should do it the other way round: first do the global config (which we have the infrastructure to do right now), and then investigate how the same thing could be specialized for course-level settings with a minimum of fuss. This would lead us to lay down the infrastructure for course-level configuration in each and every block.\n\n\n\nComments?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  25 May 2004, 12:42 AM:\n\ntraditionall\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Saturday,  30 October 2004, 01:32 AM:\n\nUmmmm....\n\n\n\nI think this was a bit out of date, what with Blocks2 and all? :D",

    "Description": "ANNOTATION module?\n\n\n\nI see this as a modified copy of glossary, but one that is activity specific.\n\n\n\n1. Create an activity called Annotation.  \n\n\n\n Choose source activity to annotate: (could be anything where data is stored in database, journals, forums, html or moodle resources, etc..)\n\n \n\n Allow grades (and ratings).  (student and teacher?).\n\n\n\n\n\n2. When the activity is opened, everyone sees a split screen. The source activity is on the left, the annotation is on the right.\n\n\n\n3. On the annotation side they would see a list of current annotations,  also behind tabs, Add new annotation,  browse annotations and browse by author.\n\n\n\n4.  To add a new annotation, students would type in a word or phrase from the source activity.  Their definition of the word or phrase would be their annotation.  After creating a new annotation, the left side would refresh to account for the new marks.\n\n\n\n5. Teachers could grade the individual annotations (as we now grade the glossaries).\n\n\n\n6.  Maybe the course page could have its own annotation, floating in a side block...\n\n\n\nThe thing that I imagine would be most difficult is having the source document line up with the annotations.  Maybe some anchor tags could be placed so that when you browse the source, the annotations line up, or vice-versa?  Still, even if this line-up didn't work, I imagine this would be a great tool for a group to review a document.",

      "01/Sep/04 3:22 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  12 May 2004, 01:32 AM:\n\nI think translating the error message would be a VERY bad idea. If we do, then soon we will be getting bug reports where we don't understand the error messages anymore. \n\nPeople who can fix bugs themselves will understand english error messages. Others don't have to understand the hardcoded messages but should report them as a bug. After all, any hardcoded error message represents a bug. All errors that can be caused by user input should already be using language strings. \n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  12 May 2004, 02:31 AM:\n\nUhm, what was I thinking? :-I\n\n\n\nI think your affirmations is correct if EVERY hardcoded error message in Moodle makes reference to a bug. And I'm not sure if this is completely true now or hardcoded messages are used to show some wrong situations that aren't bugs... perhaps adding an error code could help us having them localised, isn't it? ;-)\n\n\n\nRegards, Eloy :-)\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  12 May 2004, 11:03 AM:\n\nI think there's a need for both.  My rule of thumb has been to not translate things which only an admin would see in a malfunctioning situation - all possible student errors should be translated (and are to my knowledge).\n\n\n\nHowever, for completeness it would be nice if even these admin errors came up in the local language.  A few of them are not really bugs but merely pointing out things that need to be changed in the environment etc ... \n\n\n\nI like the idea of error codes, that's the solution here.  We could use numbers, but my preference is to use the lookupstring itself (much like is done on the Variables page) ... then we can have a glossary on moodle.org to autolink those phrases.\n\n\n\nSo, I propose a new function called errorcode() called like this:\n\n\n\n   errorcode('noconfigfile');\n\n\n\nwhich functions like error() but takes the string from error.php.  That way we can replace calls to error() gradually and easily.\n\n\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  12 May 2004, 02:58 PM:\n\nSound fine for me...\n\nAnd the errorcode() will show the errrorcode (lookupstring) plus the translation in errors.php, isn't it?\n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  12 May 2004, 03:02 PM:\n\nYes, that is perfect, especially if the error message contains a link to page on moodle.org that can automatically determine if there is some help available for that particular error.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  12 May 2004, 03:26 PM:\n\nWhoah, that sound great too!!\n\nFrom Daryl Hawes (dhawes at mac.com) Friday,  28 May 2004, 12:17 AM:\n\nI like the idea of an errorcode function.\n\nMy only additional request would be that the url argument be maintained and a module argument be added.\n\n\n\nexample function declaration\n\n\n\n/*\n\n* errorcode\n\n*   provide a localized error message to the user\n\n*   url - url to be used in displaying 'continue' button to the user\n\n*   module - name of the module that this error is associated with\n\n*/\n\nfuncti0n errorcode($errorcode, $module=moodle, $url=) \n\n\n\nThe error page would display similar to the current error page along with the current continue link, but would also include a 'more information' link to moodle.org as delius suggests.\n\n\n\nsample calls:\n\nerrorcode('noconfigfile');\n\nerrorcode('noconfigfile', 'forum');\n\nerrorcode('noconfigfile', 'calendar', $CFG->wwwroot.'/calendar/index.php');\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 07:22 PM:\n\nSee also proposal to log notices in MDL-1851",

      "05/Jun/04 4:24 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday, 9 May 2004, 11:57 PM:\n\nAnd why do you insist on the initial page name being in wiki name format? The Wiki can handle names with spaces and especiall for people using html format rather than wiki format that would be much more natural.\n\nFrom Mike Churchward (mike at churchward.ca) Monday,  10 May 2004, 10:22 PM:\n\nThe default name will default to the wiki name, if you choose an empty wiki, and you don't specify a specific page name. However, it will 'wiki'ize the name, as you noted. I'll look into allowing spaces in the page names. I figured it would be much easier for users to get used to creating pages using wiki names, rather than teaching them a new tagging system.\n\nFrom Mike Churchward (mike at churchward.ca) Monday,  10 May 2004, 11:00 PM:\n\nSorry, you're right, we changed that. It used to default to the wiki name; now it defaults to the language default. There was a reason for using the language default, but I can't remember why...\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  10 May 2004, 11:19 PM:\n\nI am confused now. Did you perhaps mean It used to default to the language default; now it defaults to the wiki name?\n\nFrom Mike Churchward (mike at churchward.ca) Tuesday,  11 May 2004, 08:39 PM:\n\nNo. I mean the first release of it we defaulted to the Wiki name, if the page name wasn't specified. But there is a need for an index page name when you use an initial content specification.\n\n\n\nSo, maybe what we need is:\n\n- Empty Initial Content -\n\n    > if page name is non-empty, use it,\n\n    > otherwise use wiki name.\n\n- Initial Content Specified -\n\n    > (some way to specify index page for initial content?)\n\n    > language wiki index name.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Mike Churchward (mike at churchward.ca) Thursday, 3 June 2004, 03:02 AM:\n\nPage name now defaults to wiki name if no page name is specified and no initial content is selected.\n\n\n\nAlso removed the requirement for CamelCase for the defined page name.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Friday, 4 June 2004, 03:52 PM:\n\nBut the help file wikiname.html still says  If you do not specify a name in wiki 'camel case' (mixed upper and lower case words, compressed together - e.g. 'WikiName'), then whatever you enter will be forced into camel case.\n\nThat should be removed, I think.\n\nFrom Mike Churchward (mike at churchward.ca) Friday, 4 June 2004, 08:24 PM:\n\nFixed help file.

All I meant was to have a reserved coursename (possibly within each category) to act as a template, and when adding new course, preload the values in that template into the fields prior to editing, and copy the resources from that 'template course' when clicking the 'save' button.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  25 May 2004, 01:00 AM:\n\nIn that case what I said earlier would get two bird with one stick ... if any course could be used as the source template, then it's easy to create a hidden course with a meaningful name and choose it from the menu.\n\nFrom Paul Duff (paulduff at wiltscoll.ac.uk) Tuesday,  25 May 2004, 01:17 AM:\n\nOn reflection - little difference.

Everywhere else in Moodle options that are not with the dreaded yes/no drop-down menus (that I thinks should all disappear) are selected with checkboxes rather than with yes/no radio buttons.\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Tuesday,  28 June 2005, 09:49 PM:\n\nThanks Eloy!\n\nI agree that check boxes would be even more usable, but the radio buttons would be fine too (as per attachment). The important thing is the ability to select all or deselect all. \n\nIs this in CVS? \n\nI won't be upgrading to 1.5 until the end of this month, when the first semester ends. \n\nTim\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  29 June 2005, 12:12 AM:\n\nAttached, the appearance of the restore page with checkboxes. Is this the preferred one, then? \n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  29 June 2005, 12:58 AM:\n\nIf you go ahead with the checkboxes (which I find simpler) then you  only need the Include once at the top of the table and the rows of the table just have to be labeled by the name of the module. So you would have Quiz instead of Include Quiz. That will make it slightly easier to quickly find the right entry in the table.\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Wednesday,  29 June 2005, 09:18 AM:\n\nYes, I like it. But if you use the word include then perhaps remove would be nice too. I think that include all/none is fine. What is on the other page?\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  29 June 2005, 05:44 PM:\n\nOk. Time to another simulation (see attached image). \n\n\n\nPlease vote for 1, 2 or 3. ;-)\n\n\n\nAnd, what is, What is on the other page?. The backup one, perhaps?\n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  29 June 2005, 06:12 PM:\n\nI vote for 3.\n\n\n\nA similar page will be used for backup as well, I assume?\n\n\n\nCan you please also get rid of a few of the pages that are currently shown during backup and restore? I don't want to be asked for confirmation and I don't want to have to click Continue, it should just do what I select on this one page.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  29 June 2005, 06:59 PM:\n\nOk. With one more vote for 3, I'll go to it, both in backup and restore using that approach.\n\n\n\nAbout 'compressing' the number of pages, mainly in restore, I'm not absolutely sure if doing it is a good idea. If I'm not wrong, there are 2 clicks that could be avoided (the first one showed after clicking over 'restore' in the FileManager and the last one showed once you have configured everything. But 2 clicks isn't too much and restore is  an important decision, as users and lots of data will be uploaded without undo possibilities at all. I propose to leave it for now....ok?\n\n\n\nCiao :-) \n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  29 June 2005, 07:08 PM:\n\nAfter the teacher clicks on Restore the teacher should only be asked for confirmation once, namely by filling in the form. Currently the teacher is essentially asked for comfirmation three times and that is very annoying. It is enough if above the button on the settings page you print a warning about the fact that the restore can not be undone.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Thursday,  30 June 2005, 12:59 AM:\n\nDone in restore. Now, I start with backup...\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Thursday,  30 June 2005, 02:31 AM:\n\nAnd in backup too! Both in 1.5 (available in next 1.5+ daily) and 1.6.\n\n\n\nAbout the discussion of the number of pages in the backup and restore process, I'm not really sure and, as both the blackboard and the import from course features are really mixed with the standard restore execution, I continue being reticent to such modification, thinking about what we win (only 2-3 clicks) if we start such modifications... \n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Monday,  10 October 2005, 02:41 PM:\n\nThanks very much indeed for this.\n\nTim",

Only in main glossaries they haven't write access.\n\n\n\nI've created a new 'editalways' setting per glossary. No my question is, how should it work?

      "16/May/06 1:41 PM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Friday,  28 May 2004, 02:28 PM:\n\nThat sounds logical. I agree.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  28 May 2004, 02:31 PM:\n\nit is often the case the full reference is needed during runtime, so the best way to solve this would be \n\nto set $CFG->wwwroot dynamically (in lib/setup.php) if it isn't defined in config.php.\n\nFrom   (jenskord at gmx.de) Friday,  28 May 2004, 06:50 PM:\n\nMistake on my part. There are only a few real http redirects (which all are erroneous). Grep for 'Location:'. They should be replaced with a call to redirect() in weblib.php.\n\nAll other redirects are via header of html pages. There it should be sufficient to use URIs without protocol etc.\n\nThis means that $CFG->wwwroot should be like '/moodle' or '' etc. and in particular without protocol and servername. State this in config.php and i am pleased.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  28 May 2004, 07:19 PM:\n\nActually, I can't see any Location headers that are being used ... but regardless, you need the full URL in $CFG->wwwroot if you want your email links to work.\n\nFrom   (jenskord at gmx.de) Friday,  28 May 2004, 08:42 PM:\n\n'Location:' found in\n\nmod/chat/drawboard.php:35\n\ntheme/poweraid/index.php:2\n\ntheme/poweraid/images/index.php:2\n\n\n\nAll files from cvs. In cvs modules contrib and mysql are more places but not listed.\n\n\n\nFor email links or generally links that must work from outside and therefore must be absolute make protocol and host (and port) extra configurable. The usage may then a bit more complex but the common case is simple i.e. most $CFG->wwwroot usages needn'd be touched. Only (?) a few mail related functions have to changed.\n\n\n\nIf you really want to determine things at runtime i have a function (that works for me;-).\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  28 May 2004, 10:46 PM:\n\nYes, I found those too.  :-)\n\n\n\nBut neither page is actually used in Moodle.\n\n\n\nYeah, send in your function.  I'd only apply it when $CFG->wwwroot is left blank so it shouldn't affect 99% of sites.\n\nFrom   (jenskord at gmx.de) Friday,  28 May 2004, 11:55 PM:\n\nOk, here it is.

    "Description": "This is a feature request, noticed because this is how I have my server set up and how I tried to set up moodle and found that I could not set it up.  The way I tried to set up moodle was by creating a moodle user on a Unix system and install the moodle files in the moodle user's public_html directory.  In order to comply with my php-cgiwrap installation I need to put all *.php files in ~/public_html/php and mirror the entire directory path to those files in ~/public_html.  Other files, (images and html templates) then are in the irrored portion under ~/public_html.  When a URL is called, such as: http://mydomain.org/~moodle/index.php, the php-cgiwrap installation, by virtue of the .php extension and the AddHandler rule in Apache's httpd.conf file for handling .php files, the request is directed through php-cgiwrap which looks the ~/public_html/php directory for the script.\n\n\n\nIn moodle, I set up my config variable:\n\n\n\n$CFG->dirroot   = '/home/moodle/public_html/php';\n\n\n\nto reflect this installation which works for loading the main index.php page during installation, but when that page looks for header.html, it looks in /home/moodle/public_html/php/theme/standard for the file, which is incorrect because it really lives in /home/moddle/public_html/theme/standard.  I could, of course, install the whole of moodle under ~/public_html/php, but the server can't server things out of the http://mydomain.org/~moodle/php directory.\n\n\n\nA user installation withough php-cgiwrap would probably work okay, but I have not tried it.\n\n\n\nAlthough there are considerations already made for suexec, I think php-cgiwrap support would be useful as well.  In some other docmentation on the moodle.org site regarding suexec support it was chosen over php-cgiwrap because of tighter security and that it doesn't allow reading of directories and writing of scripts, but this doesn't make sense because the point of php-cgiwrap is that scripts won't work unless they are permissioned with 0700.  \n\n\n\nI think that php-cgiwrap support in moodle would also be valuable to Solaris administrators, some BSD users, HP-UX users, and some Linux users as it adds extra control and security over your user's doings, which is what big installation Unix admins like.\n\n\n\nThe URL provided is to my installation of moodle under php-cgiwrap how I would have liked to have set it up.  It may not remain up but please contact me about getting it working, I can probably help.",

He could simply say, You can take the quiz NOW and click on a button next to the quiz module in order to activate it.  \n\n\n\nFor moodle, this pressing such a button could simply update the start date/time to the time of the button press, while another press to turn it off, would set the end date/time to the current time. The icon itself could be a small green/red circle that would appear in the row of icons next to the quiz modules, but perhaps regardless of whether the course was currently in 'editing mode' or not.",

    "Description": "Some discussions and replies are ephemeral. Others are keepers. Suggestion: auto-hide or auto-kill stale posts. Newcomers to a forum have an easier time ploughing through.\n\n1) HIDING: For automatic dross removal, add required-entry drop-down box above Submit button to self-set an expiration date. Writer chooses, say, from hide in 10/20/30... days, delete in 10/20/30... days or sticky. Applies to both new topic and replies. Thus writer self-moderates to summarize the forum for the longer term. Admin sets the default for the drop-down null choice. \n\n2) A soft Delete could flag record as permanent-hide from all viewers except admin and writer, who can edit anytime to upgrade as hide or sticky.\n\n2) DISPLAY: Readers viewing Forum toggle hide as a filter for viewing only the most enduring postings (or unhide if they really want to troll through everything not set to the permanent-hide.)\n\n3) STICKY: (no-hide, no-autodelete) if the post has lasting value into the future. A sticky reply forces its discussion topic to no-hide during display. Admin and original writer can edit a sticky to downgrade to hide or kill.\n\n4) CREAM: For the cream-of-the-cream posts, let Admin set a cream (super-sticky) option that causes an icon to be displayed during page-view to advise future readers of valuable content worth reading first.\n\n5) GUI - Add one drop-down box as above. Add Edit Status option link alongside the Reply link for original writer and admin.  \n\n6) DATABASE - two more small-integer fields per discussion or reply. First set to 0,1,2,3 for cream,sticky,hide,kill. Second gives number of days since posting-date for hide or kill. \n\n7) CRON not needed for the soft-delete (permanent-hide) variety since all records remain intact. Display or not is filtered during the page view.",

As I manage a high school extranet the students get a degree of fun out of having a psuedo image for their profile. After spending a few hours associating a correct image to their profile it is frustrating that it can be changed.\n\nWhat I would like is that the Administrator can view and employ the upload and delete profile image with the capacity to hide this feature from the students. A toggle of show and hide would be fantastic.\n\nThe reason is that I have been promoting our Moodle Extranet as a community based environment where transparency is the key ingredient. Knowing that the image is who the person is, is extemely important in my High School environment. \n\nYours John Bennett",

This time I decided to allow students to provide their mobile phone email address. This is very handy because it means that I can look at the users page and send students a mail to their mobile phone immediately. I increased the size of the input field in the /user/edit.html. But alas the database item length is restricted to 20 characters. It would be nice if this were increased to 50 or 60 characters to all people to make use of this field. \n\n\n\nTim",

In fact it will put them off the system.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises because unlike other discussion boards moodle messages are emailed to me from the entire forum, not just the thread I have started or responded to. The overwhelming of people's inboxes is a serious business: it could be said that moodle is generating spam because the email feature is so unfocused.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance this is going to be improved please?",

Entire forum subscriptions work as they did before; I didn't change how they function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical details:  \n\n- added a 'discussion' column to the forum_subscriptions table\n\n- added an 'allowthreadsubscription' column to the forum table\n\n- minor changes made to the files: \n\nlang/en/forum.php\n\nmod/forum/mod.html\n\nmod/forum/lib.php\n\nmod/forum/discuss.php\n\nmod/forum/subscribe.php\n\n\n\nFrom Brian Sea (sea at umr.edu) Monday,  12 December 2005, 03:29 AM:\n\nThis should be added to CVS, IMO.

Otherwise, it'd inherit their settings. \n\nIn both cases, their choices should be a bit less implied. Currently there's a profile setting (auto subscribe when i post) that most don't know about, and it catches folks off guard.\n\nThere's an option at the bottom of a post, and other places where you can subscribe/unsubscribe, but why not include that within the text of the button- so you could have two buttons:\n\n[post this message and email me responses to it] [post this message but don't send me related emails] \nyou could even have another that says [post this message and email me all discussions on this FORUM]\n\nfor layout, you could simplify by having a message:\nclick one of the buttons below to post your message and set your email subscription options. ( ? ) <-- help button\n[email me responses to my message][don't send me related emails][don't send me any emails from this whole forum]\n\nOr you could have 3 radio buttons and a [submit post] button - the radio button could inherit from a setting profile.\n\nThe 2nd option here would unusbscribe someone to a thread where they were already subscribed, and would not be available when the admin had forced subscription on all.

      "04/Apr/07 11:04 AM;712020:9e8dc460-ded6-4985-9d50-cb1a54229baa;Since my first contact with Moodle, a couple of years ago, one of the things that surprised me the most was Forum subscription instead of the omnipresent thread subscription. I can see pedagogical and technical advantages of course subscription, but thread subscription is a must in certain situation.\n\nTechnically, I think that thread subscription settings should be the value to check when sending emails. Forum subscription and unsubscription choices should reset the values of all threads and be the default value for new threads in that forum, but this could be overridden later by particular thread choices (unless forced forum subscription, of course).\n\nRegarding the interface, apart from looking at consolidated forum systems (phpbb and the like), here are my suggestions.\nGenerally speaking, there should be duplicated options for subscribing/unsubscribing to/from a thread or the entire forum.\nIn the profile, for example, the \"Forum auto-subscribe\" setting option should have 3 options, adding one named \"Yes, when I post subscribe me to that thread\" and rewording the negative one  \"No, don't automatically subscribe me\".\nThe settings in the new post form should be similar, with 4 options:\n          * \"Send me email copies of posts to this forum\"\n          * \"Send me email copies of posts to this thread\"\n          * \"I don't want email copies of posts to this thread\"\n          * \"I don't want email copies of posts to this forum\"\n\nThe default value should be the current option (in this order: no subscription to thread, forum subscription enabled, thread subscription enabled; no subscription to forum should always be explicitly choiced, giving its consequences). The profile setting should only be used for the first post to a forum.\n\nThe same duplication philosophy should apply to top-right options while viewing a forum, and to mail unsubscribe options.\n\nThere should be new options while viewing a discussion, similar to the top-right option while viewing a forum, to subscribe/unsubscribe to/from the thread.\nThere should be a new column in the \"forum view\" page for each discussion, \"Subscribed\", with the same behaviour that the same column in the \"forums index\" page, but, of course, at a thread level.\n\nI hope this help.",
      "25/Feb/08 5:35 PM;712020:9eec5093-e665-4ec4-98b9-b52edf96af9f;This seems quite complicated. Would a simpler solution be:\n\n* Fourm subscription settings as now.\n* If subscribed to a forum the user receives the initial post of every new dicussion and subsequent replies until they unsubscribe.\n* The subscription links in emails of posts, the drop down in the post interface and user profile change to manage subscription to discussions not forums.\n* Unsubscribe forums links on forum page and forums index page remain as now.",
      "26/Feb/08 10:03 AM;557058:bb189bf3-4b33-48eb-9d98-78cf6fd2b245;It does seem complicated, but I do agree with Alejo that it is needed. I really want to be able to subscribe to individual threads and not necessarily forums as a whole, especially on moodle.org. An additional option would be to have an automatic thread subscription if you post to a forum, and maybe a separate option to not subscribe to the forum, or the thread as a whole, but only to any replies to a specific post made by you.\n\nInterface wise, I think checkboxes/toggle links at the top of forums, threads and own-posts, as well as a whole site subscriptions interface, showing forums and threads you are subscribed to in tree format (course-forum-threads) so you can unsubscribe to many at once.\n\nIt would also be very useful to have a block showing recent posts only in my subscribed forums/threads, which would suit me better than the emails to be honest.

The effect I was trying to get to was a simple method of allowing users to manage subscription to individual discussions but retain a simple way of alerting them to new discussions (which they could then opt to subscribe to).\n\nAlthough it may be desirable to only subscribe to reply to posts of one's own a student may do this inadvertently and receive a very partial view of the discussion. And of course it may not be what the teacher intends.\n\n+ 1 for being able to disable subscription emails and not others. Has this been logged a feature request before?",

      "01/Feb/09 6:25 PM;712020:ce9a094b-875b-43da-a148-f85d28e81e35;Hi all.\n\nI had for quite a time felt that this was a significant shortfall in the forum module, which most particularly shows up in the General Problems forum where it is quite plain to most regular contributors that new users are completely shocked and overwhelmed by the email storm that results from their first post, such that they hurriedly switch of their subscription to the forum and never get to see the responses they may have had! \n\nIt is almost equally a problem if you unsubscribe and just keep a browser tab open and refresh it periodically - if you have answered half-a-dozen queries, then within a few days you can have forgotten which titles/users you replied to (would I EVER write that down?), they become so spaced out in the list, you may never get to see that you were asked a follow-up question! This is a less than fabulous situation.\n\nHowever, instead of complaining, I have, as I have posted in moodle.org forum and the Forum module forum, done something about it.\n\nI am posting up a patch (originally on 1.9.3) that implements subscription by discussion thread (discussion <=> thread here). Tim Hunt will I hope, in due course, check the patch to make sure I have got that part right - I believe so!\n\nTo work this patch you need an extra column in the table (mdl_)forum_subscriptions, so you must first run the sql statement:\n\nALTER TABLE `mdl_forum_subscriptions` ADD COLUMN `thread` BIGINT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER `forum`, ADD INDEX `mdl_forusubs_thr_ix` (`thread`);\n\nI have also left off a tiny (and non-critical) bit from theme/standard/styles_layout.css...\n\n#mod-forum-discuss .subscription {\nfloat: right;\ntext-align:right;\nwhite-space: nowrap;\n}\n\nBut for the rest - the changes in 11 files - are in the patch.\n\nI have annotated all changes, and you can search to find each marked by the initials JWC (later we will of course want to remove such egotism!!)\n\nI have tested it as thoroughly as I can - it is implemented on a training site in the UK, and I've got a team of people roped in to comment on it, but I am very open to suggestions for improvements. I can think of one myself: on a big site you might appreciate a check box to 'show me discussions I'm subscribed to' on the forum page, or even 'show subscribed discussions first' to alter the listing order!\n\nI too agree that this could all seem a bit overwhelming to course leader and to users. For that reason I have tried to keep the options as simple as possible and to give useful (but brief) information in the help. In short I have given three extra options for the forum itself, and what the user can see is based on which of these is chosen:\n\n4. Allow thread or forum subscriptions\n5. Automatic thread-based subscriptions\n6. Force thread-based subscriptions\n\nI'm sure there needs to be a debate about these settings to. You need to consider, particularly, what effect each would have if the teacher subscribes all course users to a the forum, when the default setting is one of the above. This issue has been considered and I hope you will appreciate the subtlety of the results.\n\nRegards,\nJohn\n",

      "02/Feb/09 6:27 AM;712020:ce9a094b-875b-43da-a148-f85d28e81e35;I thought I would add a little about what it is you are meant to see with this patch...\n\nObviously in the Forum settings panel the teacher/administrator has 3 extra options in the 'Force everyone to be subscribed?' drop-down.\n4. Allow thread or forum subscriptions\n5. Automatic thread-based subscriptions\n6. Force thread-based subscriptions\n\nAlso in the Forum page itself the t/a sees an extra fast link 'Automatic thread-based subscriptions' (if not already chosen), below 'Force everyone to be subscribed'.\n- This seems to be to be the most likely option to want.\n\nWhen option 4 is chosen 'This forum allows everyone to choose whether to subscribe or not' appears as a reminder to all users.\nWith option 5 the text is 'This forum provides thread-based subscriptions automatically'\nand with option 6 the text is 'This forum forces thread-based subscriptions'\n\nWith either option 4 or 5 all users (with a subscribable role) see an extra column in the discussion list: 'Thread subscribed?'\nThis contains yes/no buttons for instant thread subscription.\nNeither option stops the user from subscribing to the entire forum.\n\nSwitch to option 6 and these buttons become yes/no text only, because you can only be subscribed to a thread by posting in it (this state does not recurse backwards to posts you have already made if the forum settings are changed).\n\nNone of these settings stops the t/a from subscribing users to the forum, such that they appear in the forum subscribers list (which is unchanged), but if this is done the 'Thread subscribed?' column disappears as it is irrelevant!\n\nWith options 4 or 5 the user can unsubscribe from the forum (because that is not forced) and then the yes/no thread subscription buttons appear, though if you move from forum-subscribed to forum-not-subscribed, all the buttons will be in the No state, and the user can change any.\n[Note: It could be argued that for state 5 these should all default to Yes, see below.]\n\nIn state 4 or 5 you also get a fast link for 'Subscribe to this discussion thread' or 'Unsubscribe form this discussion thread' on the discussion page, \nand 2 extra options in the 'Subscription' drop-down on the posting page:\n'Send me email copies of posts to this discussion', and\n'I don't want email copies of posts to this discussion'.\n\nThe difference between these to states is that whereas in state 4, the user's profile setting for autosubscribe is used to pre-load this 'subscription' setting,\nin state 5 it is always pre-loaded to 'Send me email copies of posts to this discussion'.\nSo state 5 is automatic, not forced!.\n\nIn state 6 this option box disappears, as do the fast links and buttons for subscribing and unsubscribing.\nIn place you find that the user is subscribed to any thread they post in.\n\nBut what if all students have been pre-subscribed to the forum by the t/a with thread subscriptions in state 6?\nThen the user receives mail from all threads until he/she posts to a discussion (new or old), then their forum subscription drops out and they are subscribed to the newly posted thread only.\nThe principle of this one is that whereas the teacher may wish to hail all course participants with the merits of their forum, NOT removing the forum subscription would render it the same as Option 1 'Yes, forever'!!!\n\nThe result of all of this is that mdl_forum_subscriptions now keeps track of who is subscribed and to what forum/thread. The value thread=0 means the whole forum, which is why this must be the default setting for column 'thread' so as to keep all existing subscriptions intact.\n\nThen the cron has an additional task to do. As well as collecting all forum subscribers, it must collect all thread subscribers but it must do so in such a way that the user profile data is collected only once for all cases; and this it does.\nThen a very small change to the condition that allows emails to be generated is all that is required.\n\nSo far my tests appear good, but I have to admit to two untested areas, \n1. Does read-tracking upset this regimen - I think that unlikely, and\n2. What happens where groups are used for subscriptions.\n\nOn these, or any other matters, I am keen to receive feedback.\n\nRegards,\nJohn\n",

And I too have this squarely aimed at moodle.org, but I can see it also running internal teacher support help on larger sites perhaps.\nOr homework support 'clubs' and the like.\n\nThe most significant difference in the interface, but a modest one at that, is the extra column that any (subscribable) user sees when options 4 to 6 are used.\nI have placed a sample of what this would look like at: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=115149#p505235 along with the mtrace() output in the cron.\nAs noted above, when option 6 is chosen (if ever) the yes/no buttons shown in that screen shot for option 4 or 5, become just plain text yes/no, no longer links.\n\nI have a couple more screen clips I can post up in the same place, though these are very simple: the drop-down the teacher sees in the forum settings, and the drop-down all users see when posting.\n\nI have got one more development that I have spotted as necessary...\nWhen the user clicks: 'Subscribes to this forum', but is already subscribed by thread, all their previous thread subscriptions have no meaning (and are therefore wiped), so there needs to be a confirmation page (that ONLY shows if you have 1 or more thread subscriptions) stating something like:\n\n'You are about to subscribe to this forum as a whole.\nThis will mean losing your current subscriptions to\nseparate threads. Do you want to proceed with this?\nYes / No'\n...\n\nBut let's firstly see if what we have to date behaves itself.\n\nAnd whether I have the patch IN THE RIGHT FORMAT!!!\n\nRegards,\n\nJohn\n\n",

      "22/Feb/09 11:32 AM;712020:ce9a094b-875b-43da-a148-f85d28e81e35;At last I have finished the patch for 1.9.4, ready to attach here.\n\nThis addresses quite a number of issues or developments that I commented on above, (as well as running correctly onto 1.9.4 which the patch for 1.9.3 would not)...\n\nFor example,\n(1) The teacher switching the forum to 'force-subscribed' does not remove prior thread-subscriptions from the database (there is no need to remove these because they become irrelevant and invisible), thus they will return in the forum is switched back, but\n\n(2) the user clicking the 'Subscribe to this forum' link would remove their own thread-subscriptions, and is now warned:\n\n'You are currently subscribed to one or more discussion threads in this forum!\n\nIf you wish to DELETE all such subscriptions so as to replace these with a subscription to the entire forum, click Yes.\n\nOtherwise click No.'\n\n...but this warning only appears if the user has prior thread-subscriptions.\n\n(3) Similarly, if the teacher changes the forum settings to 'Subscriptions not allowed', when there were prior thread-subscriptions for some uses, she is warned:\n\n'There are already users subscribed to this forum or its discussion threads!\n\nIf you wish to DELETE all such subscriptions, click Yes\nYou will then need to save the forum settings again.\n\nOtherwise click No'\n\n... I also believe that this overcomes a possible residual bug whereby it may previously have been possible for emails to creep through under circumstances where forum subscriptions existed before such a change - unless, of course, this was INTENTIONAL, in which case I had better modify a call to forum_unsubscribe_all() in mod_form.php!\n\n(4) It would be a disadvantage for teachers not to be able to see whether users were subscribed to at least some forum threads, and would so easily result in the teacher forcing a subscription to the whole forum in the view/edit subscribers panel. So now, if some users have thread subscriptions a warning to that effect appears at the top of this view/edit panel (in edit mode), and the number of theard subscriptions appear in parenthesis after each username.\n\n(5) I have given the user a button option to sort their subscribed threads to the top of the discussions listing if they so wish (view.php). This naturally only appears if 'forcesubscribe' is set to any of the new options 4 to 6.\n\nThis one was potentially the messiest of all the changes, so I have kept this simple, and left a lengthy comment in mod/forum/lib.php (marked with a TODO) as to the method chosen, and why, and two other processes considered - both of which require doing more than a few minor tweaks + functions (or code blocks) added - which is really all I've done up to now.\n\n(6) I have modified Eloy's lovely AJAX to run the Yes/No buttons for thread subscription - no flashing back to refresh every time!!! But a method that works if Javascript is disabled in the local browser has been retained as well.\n\n(7) Emails needed to be modified both in terms of who gets what, and in the unsubscribe links in the footer, which now reflect whether the user is subscribe to the forum or a thread.\n\n(8) I have added in two features that might be considered completely superfluous (and hence need removing). The first of these is a 'ratings reminder', it would like this: If $CFG->forum_ratingsnudge==1 and ratings of some kind are enabled in the forum, then when the discussion ORIGINATOR chooses to unsubscribe from the thread they created, but that thread has been replied to by one of more users, if the originator has not rated any posts in the thread, they see a polite reminder.\n\n(9) and, in a similar vein, if $CFG->forum_countposts==1 then the count of the number of forum posts a user has contributed in that course appears in parenthesis after the user's name. This latter one was in response to http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=116200#p513188.\n\nIt is notable that (8) & (9) are both switched on or off globally, for all forums, as I have only provided control in mod/forum/settings.php (i.e. the admin settings page), realistically these might be more useful (or at least more acceptable) if they were controlled for the forum's own settings page, which of course would require new fields in the database!\n\n\nRegards,\nJohn",

Even if Javascript is DISABLED in the browser (have you ever tried Google Maps without Javascript???) the buttons still perform correctly in their non-AJAX state (naturally this clunks, but thats life!).\n\nHOWEVER, if thread subscriptions are allowed, but AJAX is switched OFF, then the FIRST yes/no button in the list does not perform its no-AJAX duty! ONLY THE FIRST ONE!!! \nThat's why I didn't spot it.\n\nThe cause is associated with the way the browser (well, Firefox in particularly) deals will one FORM inside another (which structure does not occur with AJAX enabled).\nNow that I know the systems and the cause, I will find the solution soon enough.\n\nMeantime, this has no bearing on the functionality with AJAX enabled.\n\n",

With this setting new users are no longer run over by the email traffic, so they are perhaps less likely to unsubscribe! And old users (that's a self-deprication) get email responses to their posts, and just leave a tab open to General Problems to check what else is coming up perhaps.\n\nSo, if this were running on Moodle.org, then personally - as a user, I would choose to accept the auto thread-subscription in the General Problems forum (immediately solving the problem you refer to), but I might subscribe to the entire 'Forum Module' forum, so that I can see if any related issues as they are raised.

      "14/Mar/09 6:36 PM;712020:f4aad3ea-cbec-4935-8843-3d55aac0a669;Hi John,\n\nthreaded subscriptions (or starred discussions, as I use to call them in my mind) are definitively a good thing. And I think that having them in forums would be awesome! B-) Great work!\n\nAnyway, I'd want to comment here some basic concepts that have been in my mind since time ago related to this functionality:\n\n1) The concept itself: Some lines above I've commented that always I've seen this as \"starred discussions\", and IMO that's the key concept: To be able to mark (star) discussions. Nothing else.\n\n2) And then, the second (and more interesting) part. To be able to use those simple stars (marks) for a bunch of things. Obviously, the most prominent thing is to be able to receive personalised mails, containing only the starred discussions. But also can imagine the possibility of viewing (in the forum discussions page) only those starred discussions (instead of all them), or track only starred discussions, or as a tool for teachers to mark discussions privately, ... or whatever anybody more imaginative than me can do with those nice stars.\n\nBut I'd separate 1) and 2) completely from start. First let's allow forum to have their discussion starred (really easy to do). We only need one configuration at global module level to enable/disable and another one at activity level (and probably one capability to decide who can \"use\" those little marks and everything associated with them).\n\nAnd then the second part, which complexity is bigger, specially when talking about subscriptions / mailouts, where there are a lot of settings to control (digest types, auto-subscription when posting, manual subscription, forced subscription...) needed to be integrated in a clever way if one forum has \"stars\" enabled and the user has permissions to use them. Sure it can be done, in fact John has done a great job thinking and implementing about that.\n\nBut, once more, and as summary... I'd separated the \"mark\" thing from the subscription functionality. Simple but can give more power to the starred discussions in the future IMO.\n\nMy 0.5 cents... ciao :-)\n\n",
      "15/Mar/09 6:18 PM;712020:ce9a094b-875b-43da-a148-f85d28e81e35;Eloy,\n\nThanks for your input. I certainly appreciate what you say about wanting to mark, tag or star discussions. But I also think that more clarity is needed.\n\nFirst of all there is a great desire to choose to subscribe to some discussion threads and not others, whether this is achieved by yes/no or by a star (which then might have other uses) is in itself immaterial. But note, we either add a column in forum_subscriptions for thread or for star/mark but not for both. If we add both we for a matrix in which it is NOT possible to both STAR a discussion and NOT SUBSCRIBE to the forum. Of course the 'stars' should not be in this table, they do not belong here. But there is a problem putting them in forum_ratings too, since this refers to POSTS not discussions. So this would suggest that it requires a new table with id, userid, discussion, starmark - but this too will generate a problem further down the line, as someone if bound to ask to be able to star (in this sense) posts rather than discussions. And this fits better (I think) with your point about teachers putting a private mark on discussions, because surely this might pertain to POSTS instead.\n\nAdded to this, if I want to starmark posts, and/or subscribe to said discussions, does this mean that when I star a post I subscribe to it, and if I have a setting in my profile to say 'Yes, subscribe to starred discussions' does that mean that I will NEVER want to star a post but not subscribe to that discussion? In short, whilst I wholly applaud the idea of 'starring' a discussion (privately) for whatever purpose I wish, AND I would CERTAINLY want to then 'show only starred discussions', I think this is almost independent of the subscription issue!\n\nInstead I want to suggest that we use the forum_ratings table for starmarks (unless we are serious about adding a whole new table) and the forum_subscriptions table for thread-based subscriptions (by adding 'thread') as I have done. In forum_ratings we need to add a boolean column for 'private' (default:0), which could be enough to do the trick, Then, if in the rating system, we have a very restricted type of rating (ONE STAR) that is allowed be Private (and that ratings can't be private and public at a whim - can you imagine the mess if the teacher didn't realize this was public or private!), then you could allow a one star rating to appear on the forum view page (if any post is starred), and that might be sufficient.\n\nFinally, however you implement a starmark system, in a new table or in ratings, if you have to collect the star data and check on a user profile setting, to see who is subscribed to a discussion then we could run into a worse issue with the program load than Dan Poltawski has expressed concern over at: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=118619#p520820 .\n\nDoes this take us further?\n\nJohn",
      "16/Mar/09 5:48 AM;712020:ce9a094b-875b-43da-a148-f85d28e81e35;...thinking about this more overnight, I believe it the mark/star implementation will require another table, with \nid, \nuserid, \npost, \nmark, \napplytodiscussion (default:0).\n\nTheoretically you could leave out the mark column (!) as any entry in the table would mean that a post is so marked - or, if post value is the initial post in a discussion and applytodiscussion=1 then the whole discussion is so marked. That way your need to star a discussion could be mated with the inevitable request to star a post.\n\nBut my earlier suggestion of using the rating system would be quite wrong!!! This would limit the use of ratings further [I already wonder that it ought to be possible to apply more than one rating scale in a forum, e.g. ratings on two different criteria (scales)], so using up the rating to facilitate this star-marking would be retrograde!\n\nAnd having decided that this is independent of ratings then it is easier to conceive using AJAX to apply a star/mark/tag to either a discussion or a post, say, at the end of the title. At the Post level this would be binary (star off/star on), but at the discussion level this would be tri-state (no star/star on a post/star on this discussion) all held in the one table. It would be nice to use the extended character set here, but it this is going to cause problems in other languages, it could be 3 little gifs.\n\nI would be very happy to set about writing this - if enough people want it. Or to hand it over to you (Eloy), or another. But I would re-iterate that this looks like functionality independent of thread subscriptions to me.\n\nDan Poltawski made a comment about Petr attacking subscriptions for 2.0 already, but I saw nothing about this in the roadmap.\n\nRegards,\nJohn",

      "19/Mar/09 8:11 AM;712020:ce9a094b-875b-43da-a148-f85d28e81e35;Ray,\n\nThanks for the feedback. You are right that I have been liberal in my use of 'threads' in place of 'discussions', although I see them as equivalent as both can be used (recursively) to mean the whole or part of such (Wikipedia). Indeed where there is plenty of room for explanatory text I have preferred to use 'discussion threads' as this leaves none in doubt, I would hope.\nWhere I am a bit concerned is where brevity is important, so should be column heading be 'discussion subscribed?' in place of 'thread subscribed?', and should the button be 'Show subscribed discussions first', not 'Show subscribed threads first'?\nI don't really feel that there is any confusion here - but if you and others tell me otherwise I will change it certainly.\nSO, DO I DROP THE EXPRESSION 'threads' ENTIRELY?\n\nYou may also note another, more subtle measure here... I made the column 'thread subscribed?' with a ?, and changed the equivalent column in the forum index page to 'subscribed?' with a ? [programmers note: I have added an extra language string (one of many) 'subscribedq' just for that, not messed with the existing one], \nI did this because the Yes/No buttons, being a button i.e it implies you click to make it act, made little sense otherwise. I have also been much more POSITIVE about the button alt/help line, the 'No' button reads 'CLICK to ALLOW emails from this discussion' - so you know you will switch to 'Yes'. \nSHOULD THE SAME BE TRUE OF THE FORUM Yes/No BUTTON TEXT?\n\nAs you know, when the user is allowed thread/discussion subscribe, I currently add 2 extra items in the subscription drop-down on the edit page. \nI NOW THINK THIS IS A MISTAKE! \nIts confusing, AND it causes an extra unnecessary weight of code in validation, in these circumstances we should only offer the new two...\n'Send me email copies of posts to this discussion', and\n'I don't want email copies of posts to this discussion'.\n...because you always have the option for subscribing to the whole forum at the forum level.\nSo I propose editing the code again.\nARE WE ALL AGREED ABOUT THIS?\n\nFinally, I add two extra features which were not subscription issues using settings:\n$CFG->forum_ratingsnudge==1 and \n$CFG->forum_countposts==1 \ndescribed as items (8) and (9) above, WELL above!\nDo these say in?\nMy own view is that the 'ratings nudge' is a code-extravagant luxury and should be removed!\nI think the 'count posts' option is much neater, addresses concerns (documented above) and only invokes code if enabled, so it can always be ignored not heavy sites.\nIS THERE A CONCENSUS ABOUT THIS?\n\nAnd finally finally, IS IT BETTER TO GO DOWN ELOY'S SUGGESTED ROUTE, OR NOT, OR BOTH?\n\nRegards to all,\nJohn\n\nSorry about the capitals but I note that this issue has been raised to Critical, so their are things to resolve lest in delay 2.0 development.",

At this time I don't see any way of having a list of subscribers fixed by admin or teacher, so that students are unable to opt in or out, except the 'Yes, forever' option where the list is ALL those who have the initialsubscriptions capability set. So it CAN be done by adding a special role and unsetting the initialsubscriptions from the student role, but it could be done by adding a 'Fixed subscriber list' option in the forum force-subscribe settings. This would hide the 'Subscribe to this forum'-type links and drop-downs, which is all that is necessary!\n\nIf such an item is to be added in it would be logical to decide on this and make it item 4 of the force-subscribe list.\n\nRegards,\n\nJohn",

Thus, rather than 'click this to do something else' it should state \"emails currently enabled / emails currently disabled\" and if the user wants to change the state they click the button. Similarly with the Forum Yes/No button. I believe this is the way other buttons work in Moodle (though I could be badly wrong). I think the advantage is that it easier for the programmer and the user to relate to a current state than a future potential change and extrapolate from that. \n\n> \"ARE WE ALL AGREED ABOUT THIS?\"\nYes I agree. Simple is good. And your logic is impeccable.\n\n>My own view is that the 'ratings nudge' is a code-extravagant luxury and should be removed!\nI think the 'count posts' option is much neater, addresses concerns (documented above) and only invokes code if enabled, so it can always be ignored not heavy sites.\nIS THERE A CONCENSUS ABOUT THIS?\n\nI consense with your position here too.\n\n>IS IT BETTER TO GO DOWN ELOY'S SUGGESTED ROUTE, OR NOT, OR BOTH?\nNope -- I think your route is well argued.\n\n>At this time I don't see any way of having a list of subscribers fixed by admin or teacher. This would hide the 'Subscribe to this forum'-type links and drop-downs, which is all that is necessary!\nI would encourage you to add this feature.

And I have now taken out the 'nudge'.\n\nThe only thing I feel needs seeing - in the flesh - to appreciate to value of is the issue over the alt/help text. From my point of view the current state (1.9.4) is deeply confusing to newer users (old hands never read that text because the don't need to hang around long enough). By heading the column Subscribed? or Thread subscribed? as appropriate, the button state answers the question Yes or No, but without the help telling you what clicking does the users asks: do I click Yes when I mean Yes, or do I click Yes when I mean No? !\n\nMore info soon I promise!\n\nJohn",

The most obvious of these was forum_is_subscribed() which we frequently call in loops.\r\n\r\nAs a result, of these changes, we can now query the subscription status of every user in a forum, in a single query.

There are cache events to invalidate the data, and perhaps that can be linked to a user, or a forum ID. Preventing the invalidation of all the data as soon as someone changes a preference.\r\n# I saw references to \\mod_forum\\subscriptions::FORUM_DISCUSSION_xxx in that same class, self:: would be enough.\r\n# Is it really necessary to set the variables and the methods as private? Would there be a usecase for partners to play override/re-use those? I usually tend to go for _protected_ except in some cases.\r\n# As most of the logic include static methods, so this is just a set of functions, would that make sense to get an instance per forum? So you do not need to pass forum around any more. It could be a singleton of course. This would help solving the inconsistencies in method parameters where some are $forum, some are $forumid, and when they are $forum I did not notice much usage of other properties. Maybe that would help for caching purposes too. As code speaks better than my English, I mean this: (food for thoughts)\r\n{noformat}\r\n$forumsub = \\mod_forum\\subscriptions::get($forumid);\r\n$forumsub->is_subscribed($userid);\r\n$forumsub->subscribe($userid);\r\n$forumsub->subscribe_to($userid, $discussionid);\r\n\r\n// Maybe we need a forum object too... but not now ;)\r\n{noformat}\r\n# I had to dive in quite a lot to understand why you needed the key forcesubscribe when subscribing a user.

      "19/Jun/14 8:21 AM;5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b;Thanks for the in-depth comments Fred, I look forward to the rest!\r\n\r\n1: fixed and pushed\r\n2: could, but is there any benefit? I kept it in the same guise as other events. Would be interested to know your rationale here.\r\n3: good catch - I should have thought about that\r\n4: I discussed this with SamH over IM and decided that it was probably not the best approach in this case. The setup costs for such caches can be quite high, especially if a cache is only used the once.\r\n5: fixed - thanks. I introduced those today /o\\\r\n6: changed to protected\r\n7: Maybe... My original thinking was from the point-of-view of cron. Most of the interactions a user has with the forum when these functions are used involve maybe two, or three calls. Conversely when cron runs you're looking at an equation taking into account the number of unique forums, unique discussions, unique posts, unique recipients, subscriptions, and discussion preferences. A per-forum singleton *could* work, but I'd be worried about the memory footprint in cron. Having a singleton per forum with a subscription cache, and discussion preference cache could work here as we would be able to throw away an entire forum if memory became tight. That said, the way that the forum cron code is currently written is user oriented. We loop through each user and send all of their forum posts in one go and that's how the current cache is also written. If we moved to a per-forum class structure then the nature of the caching would become forum oriented and when selecting all posts for a user we'd have to build each forum in turn and load it's preferences. If memory were to become an issue, we would not be able to flush parts of the cache in the knowledge that we would not need them again. Perhaps we should discuss this more tomorrow when you've had more of a look through the code.\r\n8: Not sure whether we can do much about that, though actually we should move that up one to the is_subscribed() function because if the discussionid is specified, then the force subscription check is bypassed. I've now made the move (and confirmed that doing so doesn't break unit tests).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAndrew",

We do indeed call it in a loop, but it's a considered thought though. If you look higher up, we retrieve the full record for the first 5,000 users. After that we start to only store the id and then call the get_record here if idnumber wasn't retrieved (not sure why we check idnumber but hey...) so as not to run out of memory so I guess that's a won't change. We could theoretically change the sorting (at present they're by email) such that they're ordered by the number of posts each user will receive, but that's difficult to calculate. We could also potentially store them in a request cache, but we'd still have to monitor the size of that cache because the default cache is still memory so it doesn't really help us.\r\n4) Good catch. Done\r\n5) Thanks yes - I'll double check who that was and split the commit.

That value usually comes in the form of a cache that is shared amongst API's, or may require invalidation in more than one API in such a way that it cannot be assumed or controlled from any single place.\r\nLast I looked at the caches here that wasn't the cache.\r\nOn a very general note: cache event invalidation can be a risky thing with older parts of Moodle. I'm not sure how forum stands truthfully, but normally before going down this road I would strongly suggest only invalidating by events from API's. All interaction with something through an API passes through a single point somewhere in the process which is where you would trigger your invalidation. Without the API you may find that its impossible to be sure you trigger the invalidation in all places, especially for older code like forum where it was originally acceptable to assume forum was present and interact with them in other code (obviously not the case now).\r\n\r\nIn regards to the singleton idea what I said to Andrew could be summarised by saying it is just a matter of time and effort.\r\nI agree that if time wasn't an issue a better approach would be to look at singleton class for the core forum concepts and supporting static helper classes for bulk actions.\r\nHowever I believe we are trying to get forum improvements achieved within sprints and refrain from significant modification and Petr'esq rewriting of the Forum at this stage.\r\nThe inconsistency between forumid and forum caught my eye while reviewing this as well, however when I followed back the methods I understood why Andrew has done what he has done.\r\nIt may not be the perfect approach but that in my mind would be a serious investment, and what has been done is at least logical.\r\nOn the plus side when Forum finally does get some serious loving, or a replacement is found it should be easy to map these methods to the new structures.\r\nBy no means is my answer definitive, but the current approach gets a +1 from me.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nSam\r\n",

      "23/Jun/14 11:25 PM;60ca243120d2dd0070c77e82;Hi Andrew, thanks for fixing conflicts.\r\nYou did a great job! It's a lot of code to review, so I might throw my comments here several at a time:\r\n\r\n1. Funciton \\mod_forum\\subscriptions::is_subscribed() should call get_coursemodule_from_instance() with courseid when it is available in $forum->course, it will be much faster.\r\n2. Not related to your change but it looks like has_capability('mod/forum:allowforcesubscribe', context_module::instance($cm->id), $userid) should have $doanything=false, or otherwise there is no options for admins to opt-out. But it's out of scope I guess\r\n3. get_unsubscribable_forums() - again, I can see that this is old code. Very strange check for course module visibility, it should be either excluded or $cm->uservisible should be checked. ",
      "24/Jun/14 12:29 AM;5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b;1) That can be arranged, but should possibly be a different issue so it can be backported?\r\n2) admins are not enrolled in the course so cannot subscribe\r\n3) True, though again a different issue perhaps?",
      "24/Jun/14 5:52 PM;60ca243120d2dd0070c77e82;Right, you did such a big reshuffling of the code that I keep reviewing the old code thinking it's new",
      "24/Jun/14 6:24 PM;60ca243120d2dd0070c77e82;ok, I continue\r\n\r\n4. https://github.com/andrewnicols/moodle/commit/0b6f20849ae885a30bb0ed1927e4b508c14f9ac4 - please add AMOS tag for renaming string; also disallowsubscription_help duplicates disallowsubscription\r\n5. you really should not be using static variables and use MUC instead. There is an option there for request cache which is performance-wise identical to the static variable. You won't need setup/teardown in unittests then. Grep code for cache_store::MODE_REQUEST\r\n\r\nI did not check every line of code, it's too big. But I really like the way forum code looks now and good test coverage!",
      "24/Jun/14 6:40 PM;60ca243120d2dd0070c77e82;Andrew pointed out to me the Sam's comment above about using MUC. Well, up to you guys. From my point of view forum code is so performance-unwise in terms of unnecessary and duplicating DB queries, that MUC static cache access overhead would be absolutely invisible but make the code more readable. But I'm not going to hold integration because of that.",
      "24/Jun/14 6:58 PM;5b04c63b88b6744fe4207a9b;Okay, thanks Marina. I've force-pushed an update to the branch.\r\n\r\n1) As discussed I've not made this change for the moment. I think this should be done in a separate issue as there could be places we call some of these functions when we don't have the full course object (e.g. get_unsubscribable_forums did not contain the course field).\r\n2) Again, I'll defer that to a separate issue as the code in question has just been moved into a new class and renamed\r\n3) Same again... (sorry)\r\n4) Good catch - I've sorted that string out, and added an AMOS MOV command for the rename\r\n5) As mentioned, I've discussed this at length with Sam. For the most part, the cache is rarely touched by ordinary users. When viewing a forum it is used a little, when viewing a discussion it is barely touched. The big wins are in:\r\n* moving discussions between forums - this saves 2*user count queries as I recall; and\r\n* cron.\r\nFor the first, then yes... a request cache _may_ make some sense but I'm still not convinced;\r\nFor the cron, then no... a request cache is bad. We'd have to keep fetching the cache and querying it which gets very expensive when considering larger forums.\r\nAdditionally any change to forum subscriptions would get extremely expensive too.\r\nUnit tests are not a case for using MUC.\r\n\r\nHope that's all good. Thanks!\r\n\r\nAndrew",

I know from painful experience that change here need a lot of testing to ensure that the do not introduce a subtle bug. I cannot, from a quick look at your patch, say with any certainty whether they are correct or not. They look plausible, and if you have tested and they work in all situations that you care about, then it should be safe for you to use them.\n\nHowever, the proper solution to this problem is some work I am currently doing that is destined to go into Moodle 2.1. It is described on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Question_Engine_2, and the code which is mostly working, is available from http://github.com/timhunt/Moodle-Question-Engine-2. Since this work is underway, I am not going to do anything about this issue in Moodle 1.9 or 2.0.",

When we ran the above (UPDATE) code to set all negatively marked answers in single-choice question types back to 0 we encountered problems with the regrading now giving students 0 (even on questions that don't have negative marking available like matching) and showing their attempts as \"not answered\". \n\nBecause of this we are probably going to have to roll-back our database changes and look at identifying quiz editors to speak to them about the issue. We may need to look at manually changing the negatively marked answers instead of changing them automatically."

The option Significant figures determines how many figures to show for the correct answer. Default is 2. By changing it to 3 you will get a decimal for the example questions.\n\n\n\nThis should be fixed by letting the teacher choose whether to show the correct answer with X significant figures or whether to show it with X decimals. A drop-down for choosing between Significant figures and Decimals would do it for the edit page but there is also a need for a database update to store the chosen option.\n\n\n\nIt is not related to 1891.\n\nFrom Henrik Kaipe (kaipe at users.sourceforge.net) Monday, 6 December 2004, 01:33 AM:\n\nI have now checked-in a new feature that lets you decide on the number of decimals for the correct answer.",

    "Description": "The lesson module is a great interavtive module with its branching capabilties. However.. the only option to mark an answer as right or true is the page it is referring to. If you want to mark an answer as false you HAVE to link to a former or same page. \n\nIf you want to mark an answer as false you HAVE to link to a later page.\n\n\n\nThat is very unflexible. I would like to be able to mark any answer as true or false _no matter_ where i link the answer to in the end. That way it would be alot more flexible how i guide the user through the lesson. This is all that is keeping us from setting this system live.\n\n\n\nThank you for this great product!",

This is kind of same what SID is for windows and other smb-network users (String like S-1-5-21-1216271347-3991190139-1732390643-42056). \n\nSo theres need for hidden varchar(64) field.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  11 August 2004, 07:37 PM:\n\nwhy not use the username?  that's unique too.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  11 August 2004, 07:38 PM:\n\nAnd for enrolment, there is already a flatfile enrolment plugin that will do what you want there\n\n\n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Wednesday,  11 August 2004, 11:50 PM:\n\nIn our system (and propably in other systems too) user names can change. People get married or change want to change name just for some reason. So username is not option.\n\nYes, flat file will create users, but I would like to remove/deactivate users too. And by using guid or sid we could automaticly rename moodle users when username changes. \n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  11 August 2004, 11:56 PM:\n\nHmm, need to think about this ... I still think we should  use the idnumber field ... but it shouldn't be editable ... this ties in with the revamp of user fields and being able to add arbitrary fields ...\n\n\n\nBy the way, flatfile enrolment do allow removing of enrollments ... at least they do last time I looked ... need to check that ... \n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Sunday,  15 August 2004, 11:44 PM:\n\nI still want my guid field,\n\nidnumber is human selected information for user. like sosicialsecurity number, employernumber, etc...\n\nguid's are more like primarykeys generated automaticly by database.\n\nI'm almost ready to check my syncronization code in, just if I get my guid field ;-)\n\nMaybe varchar(255) is too large, varchar(128) should be enought.\n\n  \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  17 August 2004, 12:16 PM:\n\nOK, but please wait until we branch for 1.4\n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Monday,  23 August 2004, 06:21 PM:\n\nIs it OK to commit this to HEAD ?

If I commit something to HEAD it should not affect other branches, or does it.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  28 August 2004, 04:57 PM:\n\nYep, it's OK to go into HEAD now.\n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Wednesday,  13 October 2004, 08:10 PM:\n\nThere's some code already  commited to HEAD, but I'm still making rewrite/cleanups/optimizations\n\nFrom Petri Asikainen (paca at sci.fi) Tuesday,  30 May 2006, 01:57 AM:\n\nTheres script already in moodle what can do this.

    "Description": "When setting up a resource Link to a file or web site one is presented with a field File name:. When one wants to link to a web page it may not be obvious to all users what is meant by the file name of a web page. For example is the name of google.org just that or is it http://google.org?\n\n\n\nI would actually present two options to the user: Link to a web page and Link to an uploaded file. The first one would have a field URL of the web site: and would have http:// filled in already (as is done in the link dialog for the editor). It would also have the search button. The second one would have the field File name: and an upload button and would not have all those Parameters fields.",

The problem is that Moodle doesn't know whether the user wants to create a URL-based resource or an uploaded file based resource because both have been bunched onto the same page so Moodle can't possibly do what you say it should.\n\n\n\nAnd putting google.org into the File name: field certainly does not work. Moodle interprets this as a file name, not a URL.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  21 August 2004, 04:35 PM:\n\nAh yes, sorry, google.com doesn't work any more, quite right.\n\n\n\nThe field should be prefilled with http:// though ... (checks) bugger!, somehow that got lost.  It *was* at some point.  I've fixed that in CVS just now.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  21 August 2004, 04:41 PM:\n\nAs for the two items on the menu ... I actually had that in an earlier version but combined them because the code for each submodule was 99% the same.  It also reduced the number of options on the resource menu.\n\n\n\nI would prefer seeing the actual common resource-adding interface improved if it needs to be (eg the advanced settings were meant to be in a tab) than splitting them up into two separate submodules again.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  21 August 2004, 04:42 PM:\n\nWould Location instead of File name help?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday,  21 August 2004, 04:47 PM:\n\nLocation would be an improvement, wonder what the translators will come up with though.\n\n\n\nI still think that splitting it up into two items on the Add resource... list would be clearer. I think we should ask for opinions in the forums. I don't see that there is any problem with the list being too long. The two options could still be handled by the same code, just with a few conditionals to slightly adjust the display to suit the specific case.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  21 August 2004, 04:59 PM:\n\nNo it's not just a matter of a few conditionals ... \n\n\n\nChanging this right now is a bad time.  Should have objected months ago ...\n\n\n\nI'll leave it open to revisit in future.",

Beside the ever growing size of the language packs, I couldn't come up with a good reason not to include them. It would make the installation of a downloadable module easier (no languageproblems anymore) and it would make the maintenance of those translations a lot easier, since the translation can be checked in by the translator in stead of being send to the creator of the module.\n\n\n\nSo my suggestion is to add all the language files from the modules on the downloadpage immediately on the right place in the language packs.",

But I feel quite out of tune with this wrong name order in log.\n\n\n\nI upgraded the moodle to 1.5 dev ver.2004083000, but I can not confirm your fix for this . \n\nAnd I can not find log_print() function .

I will post here when I have fixed it.\n\nFrom taka kago (kt_j at yahoo.co.jp) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 06:31 PM:\n\nSorry. I was mistaken about the meaning of 'could'.\n\n\n\nAnd now I remembered that I posted about this problem to the forum General problem , befor.(very sorry)\n\nSo I have to  modify the database table log_display for these log entries , right?\n\n\n\nCONCAT(lastname, , firstname)\n\n\n\n\n\nM....

      "02/Sep/04 11:13 PM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday,  30 August 2004, 06:28 AM:\n\nOk I'll do it in that scripts but I think that it could be interesting to implement the strip_tags() call inside the require_variable() and optional_variable() functions.\n\n\n\nPerhaps adding one new parameter to them (strip_tags=true/false) could improve things a lot instead of inserting a lot of code, and I think that practically every parameter in each script can present the same problem, isn't it?\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday,  30 August 2004, 06:58 AM:\n\nDone in CVS! Thanks skodak...\n\n\n\nAny comment about implementing the strip_tags() inside optional_variable() and required_variable() ?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  30 August 2004, 12:28 PM:\n\nAbsolutely, yes, Eloy, in those functions would be best.  perhaps in 1.5 we can do this and also fix the related stuff with those functions that we talked about in another bug (not sure where it is now ...)\n\nFrom Petr Skoda (skodak at centrum.cz) Monday,  30 August 2004, 01:54 PM:\n\nI do agree, the more checks the better ;-)\n\n\n\nmaybe the require_variable could have one more parameter - the TYPE: numeric, clean text, unchecked, url, file, ...\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 12:25 AM:\n\nYes, we were talking about the modification of the require_variable() and optional_variable() functions some time ago with Ray. If I'm not wrong the idea was to delete completely some code in lib/setup.php that is 'emulating' the register_globals functionality and then, use such functions to do all the work.\n\n\n\nTo do this, it's necessary to review every script in Moodle to use ALWAYS the functions for each possible parameter, but benefits will be positive (I think).\n\n\n\nCould we start it after 1.4?\n\n\n\nPS: Another possible check to delegate to the functions can be to validate the method (POST, GET) of the parameter being passed (only an idea).\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 12:27 AM:\n\nABsolutely, GET/POST was one of the things ... can someone find that bug?  I had a quick look but couldn't?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 12:28 AM:\n\nAnd I like the type idea too, Petr\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 01:10 AM:\n\nAbout the original discussion, it was consist in some emails between Ray, you and me (no pre-existing bug, I think). \n\n\n\nSuch emails were written from 22 Feb to 19 March 2004 under the subject About your module....\n\n\n\nI've included a copy of the last one here as an attachment. Sorry it has to be read from bottom to top!!\n\n\n\nHope it helps...ciao :-)\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Thursday, 2 September 2004, 03:07 PM:\n\nI'll close this just now and open one new bug for this...\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Thursday, 2 September 2004, 03:13 PM:\n\nMDL-1865 is the new one, subscribe if you want...:-)",

So I find a lot of logs which appear to show that someone accessed a certain page even though they turn out not to have the authority. I would like to be able to see this in the logs somehow.\n\n\n\nMy idea: a new function notice_with_log() as an alternative to notice() which is called with the name of the language string rather than with its translation and which logs the referring page and the notice. This could then be used where appropriate, for example when a user fails the isteacher or isstudent tests.",

I wanted to keep the old notice() function for backwards compatibility.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 07:08 PM:\n\nThere's a bug somewhere here about a complete revamp of the error system anyway, that would use error names like get_string() does, which would be taken from error.php.\n\n\n\nThe errorname itself would be printed in the error messages, with a link to a database on moodle.org with more details about the error and possible fixes.\n\n\n\nThis should tie in with all that rather than just having a particular new logging function ...\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 07:17 PM:\n\nGood idea. However I wasn't actually thinking of errors (which shouldn't happen in normal operation) but of notices. I just want to fix the problem that the logs give me the impression that someone has seen a resource if in reality they only tried to but were refused. \n\n\n\nBut I will search for the error bug report and link it to this one.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 07:21 PM:\n\nThe bug about a new error handling system is #1342\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 07:30 PM:\n\nIf that's happening (logs show someone has viewed a resource but shouldn't have been able to) then add_to_log is in the wrong place and should be fixed.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 07:33 PM:\n\nResources look OK, I think ... which activities do you mean?\n\n\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Tuesday,  31 August 2004, 08:15 PM:\n\nWell, resources is one of the modules where there are no access restrictions to either guests or ungrouped users.

Why not take the same UI?\n\n\n\nTo delete Users (authenticated by pop3 Server) you have to delet them in\n\nadministration->users->Edit user account. Isn't it?\n\nWhy not use the same UI like assign creators? Then you can bulk select more than one student and delete them.\n\nWhen you insert radio-buttons for sorting (lastname,city/town, etc.) it will be possible to select a whole class of students when they are told to fill in their class-nr. in the city/town field of their profile.\n\n\n\nAlso useful is to display alway (or only on switching a setting in the global variables) the $user->username of a user. Many students are choosing 'Donald Duck' as their name and the teacher has no chance to see their login-usernames (pop-authentification).\n\n\n\nThank you",

No problem from me :-)\n\n\n\nOnly one question. If the concept become an URL, what is the meaning of the definition field. And how are linked such concepts by the glossary filter?\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Saturday, 4 September 2004, 02:04 AM:\n\nThinking about it a bit more...I'm not really sure it that is a good idea (perhaps it will muddle up the module..??) Why not to use the definition field to store URLs and then create a new format to show such entries in a proper form)). Adding to Martin to this, perhaps his majesty will contribute with a new perspective...\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 4 September 2004, 02:40 AM:\n\nHi Eloy,\n\n\n\nin my use as a collaborative web link collection the definition field is for a description of the website. So I can't use the description field for the URL.\n\n\n\nThe glossary filter would probably not be used for such web-link collections but if desired it could be used as in any other glossary. Note that the concept field contains the name for the web link, not its URL.\n\n\n\nIt would of course be nice if one could change the Concept to Name and the Definition to Description. Perhaps the formats could also define the names for these strings? We could then have a special Link collection format.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 5 September 2004, 11:27 PM:\n\nThis particular change is OK by me, and I can see the value for your application here, but (sigh) then what's next?  A field for a picture?  Someone says I need two pictures ...  Sound files?  Movie files?  Someone then says, I need a custom field to correspond to my categories on this other system X ...  etc \n\n\n\nALL of this is what the Data Module is supposed to solve in an elegant and generic fashion.   Meanwhile the Glossary module continues to expand and lurch towards an ungainly approximation of the same goal in a series of quick-fix additions like this one.\n\n\n\nI think the URL field being present on the entry screen would probably confuse newcomers who are grappling with what a Glossary module is in the first place, and then a Link collection format would probably look odd when applied to a normal glossary without links ...\n\n\n\nPlease leave it out for now ... I'll try and get this Data module started.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Tuesday,  30 November 2004, 08:50 PM:\n\nJust cleaning some bugs. If this isn't going to be implemented, can I close it?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday, 1 December 2004, 02:14 AM:\n\nIt is good of you to do a bit of housecleaning in this bug tracker. I think this bug can be closed. I can understand Martin's reasons.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Saturday,  11 December 2004, 03:01 AM:\n\nThanks Gustav. Closing it just now!",

Deleting it doesn't seem to affect the display anyway.\n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Tuesday, 7 September 2004, 06:53 AM:\n\nAlso, the cellpadding and cellspacing values vary between the different files. These should probably be 'harmonised'. \n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Tuesday, 7 September 2004, 06:55 AM:\n\nSorry, that last comment was a little vague.

For these reasons, I guess I think more Moodle-ness is really necessary.  This is a HUGELY cool tool, but I don't think it is going to catch on yet with the many Moodlers who a) need notifications between teacher and student and b)  who are managing big numbers of students.\n\n\n\nEven attaching a grade scale would provide some more useful feedback to students.\n\n\n\nThanks so much!",

CVS access would be a bless ;)\n\n\n\nPS Martin: What's the Moodle process for such patches? Are we supposed to provide an installation for the Moodle folks to test the stuff? \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday,  15 September 2004, 08:19 PM:\n\nBasically I get final say on what goes in ... I'm very busy so changes that are small, useful and well presented tend to get included earlier.\n\n\n\nYour presentation and code her is excellent so I'll try to get it into HEAD as soon as I can.  Could I ask you to provide patches against HEAD?  That would make my job a little easier.\n\n\n\nThank you for the useful contribution!\n\nFrom Hannes Gassert (hannes at mediagonal.ch) Thursday,  16 September 2004, 10:29 PM:\n\nAlright, I made patches against today's CVS HEAD. This only affected the language files, looks like the other files were unchanged since last release. \n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Wednesday,  29 September 2004, 10:13 AM:\n\nThats very much Brian. \n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  15 December 2004, 04:59 AM:\n\nWhat is the status of this? It looks to me like it should go into Moodle 1.5 dev. I volunteer to help to do that if Martin wants.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday,  29 December 2004, 06:39 PM:\n\nMartin, what are your plans with this?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 2 January 2005, 04:13 PM:\n\nI ran out of time, sorry.  Gustav, do you want to apply the patches to HEAD and make sure it's all working?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 2 January 2005, 04:14 PM:\n\nin particular, the upgrade should be smooth so that everything stays as it is until people change the nesting ...\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday, 2 January 2005, 04:33 PM:\n\nI'll take a look at it today\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday, 2 January 2005, 11:10 PM:\n\nThe code looked good and worked perfectly. I noticed no problems with the upgrade, everything worked as before until I went to Edit categories. I have now committed it.\n\nFrom oen roggemans (koen at roggemans.net) Tuesday, 4 January 2005, 12:43 AM:\n\nCategories are not shown anymore on my testserver.

Is the category drop-down list empty on edit.php?",

Just a thought, but I think it would be fairly easy to add a checkbox in the form called, \"All day event (no time)\" and then do a check for it in the upcoming events and calendar blocks.\n\nSo basically, if a user clicks the \"All day\" checkbox, it first \"greys out\" the start and end times (JS can handle this easily) and then use a conditional statement in the calendar, i.e.\nif(!$alldayischecked)\n{\n  // display start and end times\n}\n\nI just voted for it as well.",

When exported, event times are adjusted to match UTC. As I'm in the Europe/London timezone, any events occurring during Daylight Savings Time (roughly March to October) are therefore shifted back an hour, to 11pm the previous day. They're then recorded in the ics file without start or end times, and are now one day early.",

The $hints are very important, you could state if you want some special substitution character or html entities, etc. Internally iconv should be used (if available) for all single byte=SB to UTF8 conversion. In opposite direction iconv is not suitable at all, because if it finds unsupported character in SB, it just stops the conversion in the middle of a string. You could convert all language files to asci with html entities and use encoding from the course data. Or recode all interface string on the fly to the data encoding.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to use unicode tables to covert encoding in PHP only - it will be slow, but you could use it even without iconv and the conversion to html entities would be really useful.\n\n\n\nMBString's conversion supports only a few encodings - not my favourite Win-1250 :-(\n\n\n\nOf course we also need number and date formatting functions, it should not be a problem to create it in pure PHP.\n\n\n\nThere is a problem with string functions, iconv is incomplete - seems to me mbstring is the only way.\n\n\n\nAlso the php code should be strictly ascii (for example '@' is not in acsii).\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nAnyway we have to decide NOW:\n\nAre we going to use MBString function overriding?\n\n\n\nYES:\n\n * we do not need moodle_strtolower, etc.\n\n * we should not use pcre, but instead ereg\n\n\n\nNO:\n\n * we have to define all string functions with moodle_ prefix\n\n * we can not use ereg, but only pcre with u modifier\n\n * we have to define new time, number formatting functions\n\nFrom Petr Skoda (skodak at centrum.cz) Tuesday,  18 July 2006, 06:08 AM:\n\nfixed in 1.6 :-D",

      "04/Jun/06 11:43 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Friday,  24 September 2004, 05:32 AM:\n\nWould be nice if the taxonomy could be defined on a per-course basis by the teacher (much like grade scales are). Some people might want to categorize their questions differently (not using Bloom's taxonomy, but another one)\n\n\n\nJust an idea, would love to hear what you think :-)\n\nFrom Henrik Kaipe (kaipe at users.sourceforge.net) Friday,  24 September 2004, 06:37 AM:\n\nI must say that I agree with p_stencel on that not everyone wants taxonomy according to Bloom. Besides, I do not like the idea of adding more input fields to every single question editing page.\n\n\n\nI do not know how you have planned to implement this but I must suggest that you implement this Bloom Taxonomy as a separate question type that keeps all its code in its own directory under questiontypes. That way your chances to have it qualify for the official Moodle edition increases as it therewith can be easily removed by anyone who does not like it.\n\n\n\nThis can be done by implementing the Bloom question type so that it can wrap functionality from some other question types. This is already done today by question types MULTIANSWER/CLOZE (wraps numerical, multichoice and shortanswer), RANDOM (could in theory wrap any question type), CALCULATED(wraps numerical) and RANDOMSAMATCH (wraps shortanswer) so investigating how it is done for these question types can possibly give you some ideas for how it is done.\n\nFrom P. S. (p_stencel at wp.pl) Friday,  24 September 2004, 07:38 PM:\n\nHenrik and Brian, I'm afraid adding new question types (which are not really new question types but just wrappers) might be confusing. I suggest creating a course-wide setting which turns question taxonomy on/off. If it is on, the teacher can create the taxonomy. By default, taxonomy could be off.\n\n\n\nThe question remains, where should this switch (and the interface for creating the taxonomy) be located. Some possible locations could be on the course settings page, on the question bank page or on the quiz/index.php page.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFrom Brian  (brian at mediagonal.ch) Friday,  24 September 2004, 08:23 PM:\n\nIt seems that it would be easy enough to make the taxonomy visible or not, according to the teacher's wish.  How about setting it on the question category level?  I suggest this, because questions can be used in multiple courses.  To edit a question, you always have to select a question-category.  Then, whoever is maintaining a particular question category could turn the taxonomy interface on or off as they like.\n\n\n\nA nice thing about a static taxonomy, for example Bloom's taxonomy, is that it makes it easy to use Moodle's multilingual functionality.  Once the words are added to the language files, everybody can see the taxonomy descriptions in their own language.  Letting teachers add their own taxonomies is a great idea, but it seems difficult to  make it multilingual.  I know that for many people multilingualism is not an issue, but here in Switzerland, it is seemingly important.  German, French, Italian and English are all important languages in the school and university systems here.  Any clever ideas how to allow for customizable multilingual taxonomies?\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Brian  (brian at mediagonal.ch) Tuesday,  28 September 2004, 06:14 PM:\n\nDelivery date pushed out to mid-October.\n\n\n\nI'd like to get some feedback about static vs. dynamic taxonomies (see previous discussion in this bug).\n\nI'm reluctant to implement something that's difficult to make multilingual.\n\nI must admit, I haven't given it more thought myself, because I've been busy working on QTI export.\n\nFrom Brian  (brian at mediagonal.ch) Friday, 5 November 2004, 05:06 PM:\n\nstill on the todo list, just busy with other things right now.  \n\n\n\nI would like to implement this by having a course-level option to show taxonomy or not.\n\n\n\nIn my idea, the taxonomy would be a bloom taxonomy.  If people want to use other taxonomies, they would have to hack it to show their personalized taxonomies.\n\nOr, somebody could modify the code to make it completely customizable; unfortunately i just don't have the time to do that.",

For example, if we used the pipe /  and underscore _ (I'm just thinking of two symbols that probably would never be used in font css) instead, we could write:\n\n\n\nStandard Font_Trebuchet MS,Tahoma,Lucida Sans Unicode,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif/Transliteration_Transliteration Italic,Transliteration,times new roman,times,serif;font-size:x-small\n\n\n\nIn the above example, it would include the font-size:x-small as part of the tag. What do you think? Would this work?\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Tuesday,  28 February 2006, 09:43 PM:\n\nI have two more ideas about solving this:\n\n\n\n1-Make a separate field for the formatting of the font, so that you would have three fields to enter:the name to be displayed on the dropdown list, the list of fonts that are to be used, and the formatting. However, this may still cause problems unless you implement a different separator because it wouldn't allow people to add extra things like bold in addition to size etc.\n\n\n\n2-A more radical solution would be to tie the list of fonts in some way to the theme. If the fonts to be used were tagged in a proper way in the theme file, like giving each a specific class, then in the configuration all you would need to do would be to enter that class and it would know what to look for.\n\n\n\nI'm going to send a message to Urs as he may have some ideas on this as well.",

    "Description": "Hi! It was recommended that I submit the following as a feature enhancement:\n\n\n\nThe new enrollment time feature is truly a gift for classes with a rolling enrollment culture.  I am wondering.........\n\n\n\nHas anyone developed a kind of countdown that can be displayed to students letting them know how much time they have left in the course?  So each day a student knows how many days they have left in their class before their username expires?\n\n\n\nIt's easy to procrastinate in the online world!  We want our students to finish their class on time!  Maybe a countdown at the top of the screen at all times?  Maybe a countdown block?  I'm not at all technical so I don't know what would be best!  But I do know that this counter would be a blessing.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the system could even send out an email reminding students that their enrollment period was about to finish at a predefined interval before their enrollment ends, as well as send out an email once it is finished.",

I agree that it would be a simple and nice improvement. :)\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about the wordings, I realised that, depending on the two settings 'Publish results' and 'Privacy of results', the possible outcomes are a little different than the strings in your patch. For example, if the teacher selects 'Show results to students only after the choice is closed' and 'Publish full results, showing names and their choices' then we should have a string mentioning full results AND that they will be displayed only after the activity is closed. Thus, my suggested wordings for the 5 possible outcomes are as follows:\r\n{quote}Full results, showing everyone's choices, will be published after you answer.\r\n\r\nFull results, showing everyone's choices, will be published after the activity is closed.\r\n\r\nAnonymous results will be published after you answer.\r\n\r\nAnonymous results will be published after the activity is closed.\r\n\r\nThe results of this activity will not be published after you answer.\r\n{quote}",

I want to divide them up into categories by the time period in which they ruled, and sort the individual kings by the order in which they ruled.\n\n\n\nNow, let's just take the first four time periods to see the problem:\n\n\n\n1-Predynastic\n\n2-Early Dynastic\n\n3-Old Kingdom\n\n4-First Intermediate Period\n\n\n\nObviously, if you sort these alphabetically they will be out of order. Same thing would happen with the king's names in the glossary.",

It can be done, but not simply!\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Tuesday, 9 November 2004, 12:26 PM:\n\nI do know that in an Access database at least, such a thing is not that hard. I do it all the time at my work. In the table that contains the list of items, one creates an additional field that contains numbers and then one sorts by those numbers. This field is then hidden in form view from the user, so they just see the custom sort order. In Access at least, one can add additional items in the middle of the list, simply by adding a decimal number. So if you have items 1-10, and you want to add something later after item 8, you just give it the number 8.1, and then it sorts properly, after item 8.\n\nFrom Chardelle Busch (chardelle at lifeworkouts.com) Monday, 7 November 2005, 11:23 AM:\n\nI' adding to this my comments from a post:\n\nI was wondering if anyone has any ideas about how to use the Browse by Alphabet when it doesn't make sense--for example, with an FAQ, all of the entries begin with I (I need to....) or H (How do I....). This looks rather silly and doesn't add any value to the glossary. There is no option to get rid of the Browse by Alphabet tab (although I could comment it out in tabs.html).\n\nFrom Samuli Karevaara (samuli.karevaara at lamk.fi) Thursday,  10 November 2005, 03:22 AM:\n\nAs a workaround you could add the number in front of the item names, then the alphabetical ordering would be what you make it to be. I use this often with file names to get them to be in a custom order. Not the prettiest solution, but works.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Thursday,  13 April 2006, 07:41 AM:\n\nI had an idea about this-why not allow the teacher to move the categories for a glossary up and down on the list so as to produce something other than alphabetical order?",

Then the corrected grade is manually entered into a seperate gradebook tracker. \n\nThis defeats the purpose of stats to see which questions need revision and the ability of students to review their grades. She doesn't have the time to correct the questions on the fly.\n\nShe asked for a check box to flag that the quiz had been reviewed.

      "05/May/06 1:08 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  11 February 2005, 11:44 AM:\n\nIt's now set to Enrolment Duration.\n\nFrom W Page (WebPage at Ureach.com) Sunday,  13 February 2005, 12:01 AM:\n\nHi!\n\nMartin D took care of this before I voted.  Fast action. :-D\n\n\n\nWP1\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Thursday, 1 December 2005, 05:31 AM:\n\nGee, I am using Moodle the 2nd semester but until I saw this bug entry today, I thought that enrollment duration meant the amount of time during which students can join the course not the time during which the enrollment stays in effect. I think it is still ambiguous. A proof to that is for example German translation which literally states period of signing up. I wonder how many translators goofed on this one. \n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Thursday, 1 December 2005, 11:34 AM:\n\nI agree that it is still not not clear whether the noun form, enrolment, refers to the passive (students are enrolled for x amount of time) or the active (student can enrol = sign up during x amount of time). \n\n\n\nThe event we are talking about is one of student removal / un-enrolment / de-enrolment. \n\n\n\nPerhaps just course duration might work? No...that suggests that the course will end for all students. \n\n\n\nSince this is a dangerous feature, that will interest only a minority, perhpas it might be better at the end of the page, possibly in an advanced features area. I think that it is particularly designed for online education services where a certain payment results in a certain length of access to the site. \n\n\n\nFor those of us more conventional insitutions it may still be of use, but then (as pointed out by Julian Ridden on the forums \n\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=35281&parent=163549\n\n) it would be as a course end date, rather than a duration. \n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Tuesday,  10 January 2006, 10:20 PM:\n\nMay be instead of Enrolment duration the label could be something like one of the following\n\n\n\nStudents will stay enroled for (x days)\n\nEnrolment stays in effect for (x days)\n\nAttendance allowed for (x days)\n\nParticipation allowed for (x days)\n\nEnrolment terminated after (x days)\n\n\n\nMore wordy but less ambiguous.\n\n\n\nI also hope that the parallel feature to set a date for automatic unenrolment will really make it into 1.6.\n\nFrom   (eslteacher at gmail.com) Saturday,  18 March 2006, 06:58 AM:\n\nvery poor wording on this one. I lost a wack of students because I thought it was limiting how long students were allowed to enroll from course start date.\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Saturday,  18 March 2006, 11:10 PM:\n\nIt is difficult to get the right wording but I think that this is so important that it should have verbose wording or some sort of warning because so many of us get it wrong.",
      "05/Sep/07 7:33 PM;712020:ad2b5cc1-3b42-4b54-a8b7-54d6da0ce992;I too have always been confused about Enrollment duration.  I came to the tracker expecting clarification.  But after reading the above comments, I am even more confused!\n\nI'm going with the assumption that enrollment duration means \"course duration.\"  A course lasts from StartDate to StartDate + CourseDuration, at which time all students are automatically unenrolled.  If no StartDate is specified, the clock starts ticking for each student when the student enrolls, and the student is automatically unenrolled CourseDuration days later.\n\nIs this correct?",
      "06/Aug/09 4:31 AM;712020:08373fc8-9132-4753-b7fe-5f615d31546d;This was also mentioned in Using Moodle.\n\nAt the moment there is no help icon for this form item explaining anything. Assuming Helen and Jason think it is okay, I think the help text in Using Moodle is good, with a small modification:\n\nIn addition to the above suggestions to change the label, we could add a help icon in the course setting form for the Enrolment duration setting, with at least the writing: \"If Enrolment duration is set, students are automatically unenrolled after the specified time has elapsed.\"\n\nFrom Using Moodle (Cole, Foster):\n\n\"This setting specifies the number of days a student is enrolled in the course,\nstarting from the day she enrolls. If set, students are automatically unenrolled\nafter the specified time has elapsed. This setting is useful for rolling courses\nwithout a specific start or end date.\nBe very careful when using the enrollment duration setting.\nJason: When I first started using Moodle, I thought the enrollment\nduration was how long a student had to enroll in a\ncourse, not how long she would stay enrolled. After 14 days,\nhundreds of students were suddenly unenrolled from their\ncourses, causing headaches for weeks.\"\n\nProbably affects all older versions too.",
      "10/Sep/09 3:21 PM;557058:767ae8e7-c321-4615-8d2d-8e056ca8148b;In v.19.5+ it's still unclear from the UI that (1) the duration applies to the course you're looking at and not site-wide; (2) duration means the student is enrolled in the course, not the time they can enrol\n\nAlso, there's nothing in the docs about this: http://docs.moodle.org/en/admin/roles/assign, the \"Moodle docs for this page\".\n\nWe could use a context-sensitive help icon on the Enrollent Duration line pointing to http://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_settings#Enrolment_duration",

(Jaroslav's hack did not work on a site homepage).\n\n\n\nFor clarity's sake I've decided to replace Jaroslav's allbutteachers string with 2 new strings.\n\nThis hack works for Moodle 1.5.3 stable.\n\n\n\nI've attached the 2 modified files (/course/lib.php and /course/log.php) as well as the diff files against latest official files for anyone who wishes to have a look at the modified lines.\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for use:\n\n- download lib.php and log.php (dated 27-Feb-2006)\n\n- copy these files to /yourmoodledir/course/ (and rewrite the original ones)\n\n- add these lines to lang/en/moodle.php:\n\n\n\n$string['studentsonly'] = 'All students';\n\n$string['teachersonly'] = 'All teachers';\n\nFrom Joseph R?zeau (joseph.rezeau at uhb.fr) Monday,  27 February 2006, 05:22 PM:\n\nOops!\n\na) my diff files have a .txt extension\n\nb) my hacked files have _jr in their name...\n\n\n\nMODIFIED INSTRUCTIONS for use:\n\n-> download lib_jr.php and log_jr.php (dated 27-Feb-2006)\n\n-> rename to lib.php and log.php\n\n- copy these files to /yourmoodledir/course/ (and rewrite the original ones)\n\netc.\n\nJoseph\n\nFrom Joseph R?zeau (joseph.rezeau at uhb.fr) Sunday,  30 April 2006, 10:16 PM:\n\nIt would be very useful if someone could make this Option to exclude teacher from course logs available in Moodle 1.6!\n\nI've been asking for this for months...\n\nAny takers?\n\nJoseph",

Is there a way to force the initial language chosen for a user to be something other than English? \n\n\n\nAnd also, perhaps a feature that allows the admin to prevent the student from changing their language altogether would be nice. In my case I have different language packs with names like en_gd (for my site) and en_oe (for a certain course) and displaying these to students will simply confuse them. \n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Sunday,  31 October 2004, 07:00 PM:\n\nOK, never mind the part about forcing the initial language. I was seeing English for accounts I created before I created the new language pack.\n\n\n\nHowever, the feature request for hiding this option altogether still stands.

Besides that other nice things (for schools) of ejabberd could be:\n\n* nearly XMPP compliance\n\n* many features out-of-the-box like Publish-Subscribe (most of them in modules)\n\n* support for LDAP authentification (which is used a lot in schools/universities AFAIK)\n\n* support for xml:lang (this means the webinterface, disco nodes, and other parts can be translated): currently available languages are de, en, es, fr, nl, ru and uk.\n\n* stable\n\n\n\nps: I selected Component All, as you can do many more cool things with Jabber/XMPP.",

This would require changing the question types to handle this.  This perhaps only makes sense for multiple-choice, true-false and numerical type questions.  The current question types would of course continue to function whether or not they are modified.\n\n\n\nif 2) is implemented for a question type:\n\n3) during quiz taking, the student could be presented with this instantaneous feedback.\n\n\n\nInstantaneous feedback?!  What's that???\n\nCurrently, feedback is given in Moodle only after the student has submitted the quiz.  Instantaneous feedback would provide a sort of coaching for the student while he/she is taking the quiz. For example: when the student clicks on an incorrect answer, he/she is immediately given feedback  (e.g. 'No, not that one, try again' - or something more useful in the context of the quiz).  This would require javascript to handle the feedback - or the use of an alternate question presentation, for example using flash.",

    "Description": "I would like to suggest some small improvements to the layout of view.php.\n\n\n\nFirst as seen by the students: The tables could be improved by splitting up the Comment column into a Submitted and a Grade column. In the Your Assessments table perhaps there could be additional columns for Grade given by you and Average grade.\n\n\n\nIn the box at the top of the page it says: Details of Assessment: followed by a link to the Specimen Assessment Form. I think the link to the assessment form should go one line higher behind the Maximum grade and the Details of Assessment: should be below the box to refer to the description of the workshop.\n\n\n\nI have long descriptions of my workshops and students have to scroll a lot to get to the tables. Perhaps once students have submitted the long description could be moved to a separate page that is only linked from view.php.\n\n\n\nNow suggestions for the page as seen by the teacher:\n\nI am currently in the Allow Student Submissions and Assessments phase. The page is showing me my long description of the workshop which I don't really want to read any more. A link to the description would be sufficient. I then get the tabs and below there are three links: 0 Ungraded Assessments, 47 Student Submissions for Assessment, Administration. The first link should certainly be removed. The next one only links to a stripped down version of a table that is already contained on the administration page and by improving the layout there this stripped down table becomes redundant. So this link should disappear as well. Finally I would also like to get rid of the last link and instead put the contents of the Administration page straight onto this page. \n\n\n\nThe tables on this administration page could be improved: Student names could become links to their profiles. Grades in the Student Assessments table could become links to the assessments. The name for the action List Student's Assessments could be shortened to List. In the Student Submissions table the submissions with large differences between assessments could be highlighted.\n\n\n\nI would be quite happy to implement some of these suggestions myself.",

No need at all for the Student Submission for Assessment or Administration screens, it could all be done from this Display of Final Grades page.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday,  12 December 2004, 12:06 AM:\n\nI have now moved an improved grades table straight onto the main page. I think that the old administration page is now no longer needed as everything can be done straight from the grade table. I have however left a link to the old page for now.",

Students from different counties don't need to be shown hear as they are all treated in the same way at this point and if we require that info it is in their profile.

Please, try it under PHP 4!!\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n - Save attachments (there are TWO above in this bug).\n\n - Unzip the zip file (1st attach) and copy it to the filters dir.\n\n - Copy the php file (2nd attach) to the lang/en dir.\n\n - Disable glossary filter and enable this.\n\n - Test, test, test...\n\n\n\nFeedback will be welcome!\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Saturday,  11 December 2004, 09:06 AM:\n\nHas anybody tested this EXPERIMENTAL filter?\n\nFrom Timothy Allen (scop at hannam.ac.kr) Saturday,  11 December 2004, 04:08 PM:\n\nHi Eloy,\n\n\n\nI will test it, but I can't download the attachments.  Is this a problem at my end or at your?\n\n\n\nTim.\n\nFrom Timothy Allen (scop at hannam.ac.kr) Saturday,  11 December 2004, 04:09 PM:\n\nActualy, I can download them but the zip file doesn't seem to work (just get an empty folder)  :-(  \n\nFrom Timothy Allen (scop at hannam.ac.kr) Monday,  13 December 2004, 12:07 AM:\n\nHi Eloy,\n\n\n\nI have downloaded the new files from the forum - http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15289&parent=76841 - and tested it extensively on my site, which is the following:  PHP 4.3.8, Fedora Core 1, Apache 2.0.50. MySQL 4.1.7, Moodle 1.4.2+ (2004083129).\n\n\n\nI have tested this new filter with all standard features.  It works in all resource types and all standard modules!  It doesn't work in a few non-standard modules such as dialogue, exercise and questionnaire (probably because filters don't work on them at all!)  Also, it doesn't work on calendar events, but does work on other calendar items drawn from course activities (such as a workshop, etc.).\n\n\n\nThis is a great improvement Eloy, thanks so much for your work.  approve  I really hope this make it into the standard moodle as an admin setting like link all occurrences or link only the first occurrence.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday,  13 December 2004, 03:17 AM:\n\nUhm, about all that places not working, I suppose that the 'standard' glossary filter doesn't work there too, isn't it?\n\n\n\nPerhaps you could open a new bug (or more) with all that places to make developers receive them (but only if the standard glossary filter isn't working there!).\n\n\n\nThanks by your feedback, if we can check it's working in every PHP installation, I'm sure it will be included in official releases...\n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\nFrom Timothy Allen (scop at hannam.ac.kr) Wednesday,  15 December 2004, 05:51 PM:\n\nHi Eloy,\n\n\n\nyes, I have checked with the standard glossary filter and confirmed that it also fails to work with those non-standard modules and the calendar.  So it is not an issue with the new filter.  I will open bugs for those areas soon!\n\n\n\nThanks again,\n\nTim.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Wednesday,  15 December 2004, 06:37 PM:\n\nOk.\n\n\n\nThanks for the feedback. \n\n\n\nIf there are more 'positive' reports I'll try to include it in 1.5...(as a standalone filter or integrated in the standard filter, I've to analyse it, mainly because some core changes have to be done to the filter structure to support such configuration options).\n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Tuesday,  29 March 2005, 01:20 AM:\n\nIt has been introduced to 1.5. Now it's possible to select to highlight:\n\n\n\n- Each occurrence (current behavior in 1.4).\n\n- First occurrence in each text block (where a text block is one post, one glossary entry...i.e one text edited in a text box in Moodle).\n\n- First occurrence in the page.\n\n\n\nFor now, they are controlled by two variables that you should define in config.php:\n\n\n\n$CFG->filtermatchonepertext = true/false;\n\n$CFG->filtermatchoneperpage = true/false;\n\n(although, perhaps they will go to the Administration/Filters page in a near future)\n\n\n\nPlease, test them....ciao :-)\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Thursday,  31 March 2005, 09:15 AM:\n\nClosing this in some days if no bad news arrive...",

    "Description": "A functionality that would allow adding a course to multiple categories.\n\n\n\nDetailed description of problem and feature below:\n\n\n\nAt start I would like to write, that it is nice to be here, thanks for possibility to use Moodle as an excellent e-learning tool. You all did a great job.\n\n\n\nI think I have one suggestion for Moodle. I am not sure if someone already wrote few words about it, sorry in case of I am doubling the topic. Let me explain the problem.\n\n\n\nAs a school of higher education we do have various types of studies. For example We offer to our students three-year bachelor courses, two-year supplementary master courses, five-year uniform master courses or postgraduate courses. Additionally some of those types can be realized in full-time or part-time. Now about subjects - some of subjects (which are courses on Moodle) do fall under all types of courses, some do not. And we do have years.. one subject can be taught in the first year of full-time studies and third year of part-time studies. One more thing.. we do have various majors.\n\n\n\nSo as You can see we do have a lot of categories one Moodle course should fall under. Now I can assign a course to one category only and I do not really know how to solve my problem. One solution is to name courses using a particular schema and use description field to add information about who is recipient of the course. Another solution is to create for example 4 copies of one course and assign it to few main categories.. but then a teacher will have to publish a new document in four courses. Hmm.. those solutions are still a half-solutions and seems that in the nearest future those can couse a lot of additional problems.\n\n\n\nI think many other schools will have to face (or already did?) this problem. What do You think about the problem ? Is it important ?\n\n\n\nFinally, how about adding such functionality to Moodle ? A functionality that would allow to assign a course to multiple categories (and a course can still remain in one category only). \n\n\n\nFrom my point of view it seems rather easy, but probably it is not. Some interfaces should be changed allowing to assign course to multiple categories and database structure should be changed too by adding new table which stores data about courseIDs and categoryIDs.\n\n\n\nDear Martin Dougiamas what do You think ?\n\n\n\nwith best regards,\n\nTomasz Jankowski",

I agree that 150 places is a pain. \n\n\n\n2) As far as I know questions are ordered in the category according to their titles when imported from GIFT, so if one names ones quiz questions starting with 001, 002, 003, etc, then they they will be in the right order. \n\n\n\nAnother way of doing it would be like the move activity/resource method on the course pages. \n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday, 2 June 2005, 07:57 PM:\n\nThis was also requested more recently in MDL-3396 by Koen.\n\nFrom Philip Norton (philip at bridgehouse.org.za) Thursday,  28 July 2005, 02:57 PM:\n\nI came across this site: http://tool-man.org/examples/sorting.html\n\n\n\nIt provides an excellent way to sort things on an XHTML page using drag-'n-drop.

Therefore the length is no longer a problem.\n\n\n\nThere is however still a problem with the events that the module adds automatically to the calendar. They currently use the description field. That needs to be changed. Either we do indeed introduce a summary field or we simply leave the description of the event empty.",

    "Description": "When copying an existing course to a new time frame (such as a new semester), each activity's start and stop dates must be manually adjusted, which can become quite tedious for a course with many activities.  This patch will provide course admins with a unified page which groups together activities by date.  Adjustments can be made individually or by groupings, either by relative date adjustments (days, hours, and minutes) or by absolut date adjustments.  Since most activities which share a common date are most likely to continue to share a common date after rolling over to a new time period, it makes the most sense to sort all activities into similar date groups so they can be updated at one time.\n\n<p>\n\nSome screenshots and discussion can be found <a href=http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=9697>here</a>.",

Students can reply only to discussions belonging to their group (i.e., the 'creator' of the discussion belongs to the same group).\n\n\n\nIs this OK for you. Could we close this?\n\n\n\nTIA and ciao :-) \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday,  20 December 2004, 05:20 PM:\n\nDavid, the groupid of the new discussion takes on whatever group you are looking at at that time (ie the little groups menu in the forum).\n\n\n\nIf you are in separate groups mode, and you select Group A from the menu, then your next new discussion will be viewable by Group A only.  \n\n\n\nIf you post to All participants then ALL groups will indeed see that announcement, but not be able to reply (by design).  Why?  Because if they could then students from different groups would start seeing each other's posts and identities, and thus it's not separate.\n\n\n\nFrom matthew Anthes-Washburn (aw at awzone.com) Thursday,  22 December 2005, 02:27 AM:\n\nIs it possible to assign groups to individual posts, or to hyperlink a reply to creating a new topic? It is desirable for a teacher to be able to make one post to start a discussion in all groups, and have members of each group post replies that are visible only to other members of their group and the teacher.\n\nFrom Christian Lebe (christian at moodle.com) Tuesday,  18 April 2006, 12:50 PM:\n\nI guess this no longer a bug, this is a feature request.",

    "Description": "Many courses operate with topics offering similar content. For example, we offer four science classes at each year level (7 to 10). Whilst the groups feature offers a limited way for users to share resources, it was suggested that a science coordinator could set up the common resources and activies in a hidden template course without any students. \n\n\n\nTeachers offering a specific science course could then link to a template course and add any additional resource and activity elements. These additions are local to just their course. The editing options for template course items would be greyed out but I envisage that they could changed by the designated teachers in the template course (such as the science coordinator)\n\n\n\nI know that in practice this needs careful thinking through as it has some implications for backing up courses etc but the ability to include ojects between templates and courses would be a great time saving for teachers of similar courses.",

I'm thinking proper web form submit buttons ... any objections?\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Friday,  28 January 2005, 10:02 PM:\n\nNot from me! ;-)\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Friday,  28 January 2005, 11:38 PM:\n\nI believe this should use the standard paging bar from weblib.php. Then if someone wants to improve that one it will benefit all of moodle. However I think it is quite adequate as it is.\n\n\n\nI have added Henrik to this bug because he wrote this navigation feature.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Saturday,  29 January 2005, 12:34 AM:\n\nUhm,\n\n\n\nrecently I wrote an 'alternative' page bar for the glossary. It should be 100% compatible with the standard one plus some improvements. Perhaps we could add some new parameter to it to allow colors and reuse it in the quiz?\n\n\n\nPerhaps is could substitute the standard one at all?\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Saturday,  29 January 2005, 01:15 AM:\n\nIt can't use the standard one, because that works one by one .. Henrik's navigation list of pages is somewhat better for this quiz purpose because it shows the question range per page. \n\n\n\nThe buttons could still improvement though.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday,  29 January 2005, 02:06 AM:\n\nGood point. It is indeed nice to see the question ranges instead of the page numbers as in the standard bar. However apart from this change it could and should look exactly like the standard one and any improvement that goes into the quiz bar should also go into the standard one. Perhaps the standard one could even get an optional parameter that determines whether it shows page numbers or entry ranges.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday,  13 February 2005, 10:58 PM:\n\nFor the time being I just made the paging bar look like the standard one even though it isn't using the same code. \n\n\n\nCan someone please check that the way I use CSS to style the toolbar is correct and gives theme creators enough control. Eventually the same styles should be used for the standard toolbar.\n\n\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 4 June 2005, 06:17 PM:\n\nI have changed the summary line for this feature request",

Each marked response is stored in the database, so a system to calculate penalties (that's the next thing I'll implement) can be devised or a student's different answers can be reviewed to better understand their difficulties.\n\n\n\nA quiz option allows to switch back to the old behaviour (default).\n\n\n\nGustav Delius has the code I wrote for this feature. It is ready to be committed to CVS.\n\n\n\nDatabase modifications:\n\n'quiz' table:\n\n- added field markindividual (config option)\n\n\n\n'quiz_responses' table:\n\n- added field 'timestamp'\n\n- added field 'marked' (keeps track of whether a response was marked i.e. the mark button was pressed or the quiz attempt was submitted)",

      "06/Feb/05 9:13 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 5 February 2005, 01:31 AM:\n\nI implemented something similar here and people find it very useful. However don't you also want to change enrol.php so that when it ask the user whether they want to enroll then the option No is changed to something like No, enter as guest?\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Saturday, 5 February 2005, 01:53 AM:\n\nAre you refering to the autologinguests switch?\n\n\n\nThis addresses a different problem. The autologinguest switch applies to users who are NOT logged in.\n\n\n\nThe code I am submitting here applies to users who are ALREADY LOGGED IN, but want to access course content (in a course in which they are not enrolled but in which guests are allowed) as a guest user.  This code logs them in as guests, while preserving their old login (same approach as loginas.php).  This code is only triggered when the desired url contains the username=guest shortcut.\n\n\n\nThe main purpose of this, as I see it, is to allow teachers to view each other's course content without having the teachers enrol in each other's courses, or having to go through the extra steps of first logging out, then logging in as guest, then logging back in as themselves.\n\n\n\nShould there be another configuration switch enabling/disabling this code?  Is there any reason a site might want to disable this approach?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 5 February 2005, 02:04 AM:\n\nZig, I understood your feature exactly the way you described it. I was not referring to the autologin feature but to a feature that we are using here in York that allows teachers to conveniently enter other courses as guests. However this goes via a modified enrol.php. \n\n\n\nWhat I don't understand about your approach is: how do teachers get the username=guest into the URL? Do you provide such links for them somewhere? Do you perhaps always add this to the links to courses if a teacher views them?\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Saturday, 5 February 2005, 02:39 AM:\n\nOK, I get the picture now.\n\n\n\nIn the situations I have in mind, there is an experienced Moodle teacher providing pointers to less experienced teachers, via urls containing the username=guest shortcut.  In such a case I think it is superfluous, even annoying, to present an extra enrol dialog.\n\n\n\nHow about combining our two approaches? If there is no username=guest in the url, then enrol.php should present an extra choice:\n\n\n\nThis course allows guests to enter: [View as Guest]\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 5 February 2005, 02:45 AM:\n\nYes, that sounds perfect.\n\n\n\nAnd my answer to your earlier question of whether there needs to be an option to switch this behaviour off would be No. This new feature does not allow people to do things they were not able to do before, it only makes it more comfortable. I can't see any reason why anyone would want to turn this off.\n\n\n\nAs far as I am concerned: please go ahead. This means one less hack I have to make when we switch to Moodle 1.5.\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Sunday, 6 February 2005, 01:13 AM:\n\nNow implemented.

Any brilliant ideas here?\n\n\n\n(note: It would take a couple of hacks or brilliant shots to have the admin mess with every page's blocks seamlessly. I strongly advise against any such solution.)\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday, 9 February 2005, 02:42 AM:\n\nYes ...\n\n\n\nWell, firstly, it's not too hard for a small site to simply include it on every course.\n\n\n\nSecondly, I had this idea in NZ for the blocks on the My Moodle page, where each block the *admin* sees has a pin icon.  Toggling the pin ON would add a flag to the block instance that would disallow the block being removed (it can still be moved).\n\n\n\nSo far so easy.  \n\n\n\nThe difficult part might be making pinned blocks on the my-moodle page only show on the my-moodle page, and pinned blocks on the course pages only affect the course pages.\n\n\n\nNew pages in any particular URL would always try to add any pinned blocks in addition to other defaults.\n\n\n\nI guess the act of pinning a block could also force an update of all the instances of that page URL ...\n\n\n\nHow hard is this sounding?  :-)\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Wednesday, 9 February 2005, 03:28 AM:\n\nVery nice! Me like! :)\n\n\n\nThe technical issues, now...\n\n\n\nFirst of all, we need to better define pinning. Pinning My Courses would be straightforward, but what if you pin an instance of a block which allows multiple, like HTML? I 'm going to ignore this problem for the time being.\n\n\n\nThe pinned status should probably go into mdl_block_instance because otherwise it will result in code I really wouldn't like... you know, bad things happening. That table has pagetype and blockid for each instance, so it shouldn't be a problem to update the pinned flags whenever we need.\n\n\n\nIt follows that pinning stuff can very easily be made to affect only those pages it should; we simply update the pages with pagetype equal to that of the page where the admin does the pinning.\n\n\n\nNew pages... well, we could so something like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT blockid FROM mdl_block_instance WHERE pagetype = 'newpagetype' AND pinned = 1\n\n\n\nThen we could compare the results with the blocks we were going to add anyway and cook it up before we start making any instances for our new page. I can't see any problems, this can also respect each blocks applicable_formats with no trouble.\n\n\n\nWhat about the admin pinning a block in a page, which doesn't exist in some other page of that type (let's say the teacher has deleted it)?\n\n\n\nWell, we can do:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT pageid FROM mdl_block_instance WHERE pagetype = 'newpagetype' AND blockid = 'pinnedblockid'\n\n\n\n(this gives all page ids where this block already exists), then:\n\n\n\nSELECT DISTINCT pageid FROM mdl_block_instance WHERE pagetype = 'newpagetype'\n\n\n\n(this gives all pages of that type). Now we can array_diff those two arrays and find the pages where the block being pinned does NOT exist.\n\n\n\nThen, add a bunch of records (one instance of the block in each page, at the default new block position, with default block config). This wouldn't require updating existing instances, as we 'll be adding the new instance at the end.\n\n\n\nFinally, proceed with pinning all necessary instances as described above.\n\n\n\nThe good part is that this would only mean modifying blocklib (which encapsulates everything), the clients (i.e. pages) don't need to know anything about pinning.\n\n\n\nOf course it's probably best if we only do this in 1.5, in 1.4 it would be quite hard if not impossible to do this seamlessly.\n\n\n\nSatisfactory?\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Friday,  11 February 2005, 07:48 AM:\n\n(( Attaching email discussion for completeness ))\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Friday,  11 February 2005, 08:02 AM:\n\nFor the my moodle page, where you do imagine putting the userid? In the pageid field? \n\n\n\nI was imagining having a new table for the user-related stuff, rather than using pageid or configdata for the userid.  \n\n\n\nThen, in terms of displaying the user's blocks, there would be just two selects. One which gets the admin-defined 'pinned' blocks, from the normal block_instance table (where pageid is ALWAYS 1, or at any rate, irrelevent, and page type is my-moodle or whatever).  \n\n\n\nThen, get all the users blocks from the new table, and put them on the end of the left/right/whatever arrays.  \n\n\n\nThis seems like a much easier approach performance-wise, especially with large numbers of courses and users (we have ~ 27k and ~ 6k, respectively). \n\n\n\nIt would really simplify the issue of what to do when the admin has pinned a block the user hasn't displayed. We'd just need to check that the user defined blocks doesn't have it already, so it doesn't get displayed again (not sure what to do with multiple-instance blocks).\n\n\n\nWe would need a new function in blocklib.php, something like blocks_get_by_user, which would call blocks_get_by_page first to get the admin defined ones, and then add the user ones on the end.\n\n\n\nThe administrators, when editing their own my moodle page, would get the pin icon, as Martin described. When they pinned a block, it would remove the entry from their own user defined blocks entries and put it in the global one, in mdl_block_instance. When they unpinned a block, it would remove it from the global one and put it back in theirs. Delete would check whether it was pinned or not, and remove it from the appropriate table.\n\n\n\nNot really sure how this relates to courses though.\n\n\n\nPerformance is really an issue for us, and forcing an update of all blocks for pin, or an insert for any course (or user) of any new pinned blocks, is really going to hit us hard :(\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Friday,  11 February 2005, 08:15 AM:\n\nHrmmm, I guess a much less elegant approach, but one that is more compatible with sticky blocks for courses, is to have allow 0-pageid entries in block_instance, which contain admin defined stickyblocks.  Get them first, and then get the blocks defined for courses/users whatever.\n\n\n\nKinda yuk though ...\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Friday,  11 February 2005, 09:12 AM:\n\nAbout the performance of pinning:\n\n\n\n>> For the my moodle page, where you do imagine putting the userid? In the pageid field?\n\n\n\n>> I was imagining having a new table for the user-related stuff, rather than using pageid\n\n>> or configdata for the userid.\n\n\n\nSure. The thing is, the primary key for this table is really (pageid, pagetype), and the pageid doubles as lots of things. But let me backtrack a bit and mention why I was naturally led to that.\n\n\n\nTo display a page, we need to construct a $PAGE object. Now it would be good for the pageid to be unique for each page of a specific type, so that we can store the blocks in mdl_block_instance. So take for example a quiz view page. What id is there already available for us, guaranteed to be unique among quizzes? You see where I 'm getting. Knowing the pagetype from the URL and the unique id from the URL as well (or, in My Moodle, from $USER->id) lets me create the page object without any further ado. Then, I get all the goodies I 've built into pages and blocks absolutely free of charge. That's the concept...\n\n\n\nIf I didn't use this method, I wouldn't be able to say blocks_execute_url_action() from the comfort of my armchair, so to speak. Really, those things are there so that developer's lives are made easier. Aren't we the developers? ;-)\n\n\n\n>> Then, in terms of displaying the user's blocks, there would be just two selects. One\n\n>> which gets the admin-defined 'pinned' blocks, from the normal block_instance table (where\n\n>> pageid is ALWAYS 1, or at any rate, irrelevent, and page type is my-moodle or whatever).\n\n\n\n>> Then, get all the users blocks from the new table, and put them on the end [...]\n\n\n\n>> This seems like a much easier approach performance-wise, especially with large numbers\n\n>> of courses and users (we have ~ 27k and ~ 6k, respectively).\n\n\n\nWhy do you say that? I 'm proposing for the select block instances query to stay exactly\n\nas is! That is, a single select which won't even have its WHERE clause expanded.\n\n(function blocks_get_by_page in blocklib).\n\n\n\n>> It would really simplify the issue of what to do when the admin has pinned a block the\n\n>> user hasn't displayed. We'd just need to check that the user defined blocks doesn't have\n\n>> it already, so it doesn't get displayed again (not sure what to do with multiple-instance\n\n>> blocks).\n\n\n\nAgain, up to the check the user doesn't already have the block part, we are saying the\n\nsame thing. Then, instead of all this second table/second query/etc., I 'm addressing the\n\nissue with actually adding the missing block at pinning time. That's one extra insert when\n\ndoing the pin (i.e., rarely) vs. one extra select every time the page is displayed.\n\n\n\nAlso, remember that with the pinned column for each instance, blocklib can decide what\n\nicons to display and if a URL blocks action is legal just by doing an if(!$instance->pinned).\n\n\n\n>> Performance is really an issue for us, and forcing an update of all blocks for pin, or\n\n>> an insert for any course (or user) of any new pinned blocks, is really going to hit us\n\n>> hard :(\n\n\n\nOK, say you have a new non-standard block and the admin pins it in My Moodle. With my proposal, that's going to be 27K bloodthirsty inserts screaming into your database. This is an absolute worst-case scenario, because if you are pinning a block which IS standard and already exists in each My Moodle page there will be no inserts at all.\n\n\n\nHowever, think about what happens when you upgrade to Moodle 1.6. Then, normal unpinned instances will need to be added for each user's My Moodle page. Let's say 5 of them. That's going to be 27K * 5 inserts going into your database anyway, there's no working around it. If it can handle that, I don't see why it couldn't handle a pinning (which of course the admin gets to time however he likes, e.g. on a Sunday morning).\n\n\n\nI see your point, definitely. IMO, if you think of how you 're going to handle the upgrade to 1.6, I believe this can tell us more about what is acceptable when pinning and what is not.\n\nFrom Martin Langhoff (martin at catalyst.net.nz) Friday,  11 February 2005, 09:15 AM:\n\nI think putting a copy of the pinned blocks explicitly in the DB on a per-user basis is a real problem. \n\n\n\nWe can select the pinned block and select the user blocks. Two SELECTs and a lot less clutter in your DB. \n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Friday,  11 February 2005, 09:28 AM:\n\nAbout how to handle multiple instances and pinning:\n\n\n\nThis occured to me while thinking about my previous reply. Incidentally, I 'd be against the pageid = 0 for pinned stuff solution not only because of yuk, but also because that's pretty restrictive (you can't pin more than one kind of each block in a page).\n\n\n\nOK, so, how to handle pinning blocks with multiple instances:\n\n\n\nThe key concept here is that multiple instances === different configuration for each instance. With this in mind, we have to address the following issues:\n\n\n\n1. If an admin pins a fully configured and working RSS client in his My Moodle, what do we do for all students? After all, they may have their own pet RSS clients in their My Moodles.\n\n\n\n2. Let's say we have solved issue 1. Then, some sunny day the admin reconfigures his RSS client. How do we know what other instances of that block to update? Shouldn't the pinned RSS clients in My Moodle also reflect this change for everyone?\n\n\n\nThe pinned column idea comes back with a vengeance:\n\n\n\n1. For non-multi blocks, this would result in checking which My Moodles don't have that block. But if you pin a block with multiple configuration, we have to assume that you want an EXACT COPY of this to appear in everyone's page. Therefore, it's not unreasonable to assume that NOONE has this exact copy already in his page (and if they have, it doesn't matter much anyway). So, start by taking for granted that we will add an instance to all pages with the same pagetype. The configdata for those instances will be of course a copy of the configdata for the instance which is being pinned. And we 'll set their pinned column to 1. So far so good.\n\n\n\n2. The trick here is to think that we don't HAVE to set pinned to 1! In fact, any non-zero value will do, because that's mainly going to be used for if($instance->pinned) checks. So, actually don't set it to 1, but set it to the instance id of the original block pinned by the admin! This way, each pinned instance will hold the information of which instance was the original pinned prototype. Now updating the configuration of the pinned prototype is going to be a breeze:\n\n\n\nUPDATE mdl_block_instance SET configdata = '...' WHERE pinned = '$instance->id'\n\n\n\n3. A final detail: we need to know that each prototype instance has been pinned, of course. Thus we need to set their pinned column to somewhat other than 0. Cool; just set it equal to their instance id. That takes care of detecting that it's pinned, and also gives us the way to know if a specific pinned instance is the prototype or a clone: ($instance->id === $instance->pinned) only for prototypes.\n\n\n\nWhile I 'm very happy with the elegance of this approach, reconfiguring the prototype of a pinned instance is going to get you an update with maybe 27K rows affected. I don't know if that's hard on the db though; I imagine that it really shouldn't be. Certainly, nothing compared to 27K queries with 1 affected row each.\n\n\n\nFeedback?\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Friday,  11 February 2005, 09:39 AM:\n\nI guess my argument against a second table like that, Martin, is that it leads to a loss of uniformity. Just like that, as a student you won't be able to move the pinned block around. Where is it going to be displayed? First? Last?\n\n\n\nWith the loss of uniformity also comes an increase in complexity. Is it justified to make the code more demanding for everyone and slower each time it executes (this is going to affect you more than most!) to avoid an once-off horde of inserts? (That's not guaranteed to be a horde of inserts! It just MIGHT be!)\n\n\n\nHow are you going to handle pinning multiple instances of the same block in My Moodle? Apart from that, which one is going to be displayed first? Can you imagine the kind of convoluted code we 'll need to juggle repositioning the blocks while working with two independent tables?\n\n\n\nAnd again, if the db cannot handle several K of inserts once, what are you going to do when upgrading to Moodle 1.6? Have ALL blocks in My Moodle be pinned?\n\n\n\nSorry if I 'm sounding kind of aggressive here, that's really not my intent. If you could show me your database just crashing when it's given that kind of workload, I 'll back off right now. What I 'm really trying to accomplish is steer Moodle clear of an unnecessary complex solution IF WE CAN LIVE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE.\n\n\n\nSo I just mean to ask nicely, Are you guys 100% sure that we cannnot? :)\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Friday,  11 February 2005, 09:46 AM:\n\nOk, how about a new solution.\n\n\n\nKeep the user blocks in the block_instance table, with userid in the page id field. \n\n\n\nAdd a new table, called block_defaults, which has a pagetype field, but no pageid field.  That solves the discrepencies between course/activity stuff and mymoodle stuff.  \n\n\n\nAlso, it means you don't need to force updates ever.  It does mean that you always need two selects, one for the defaults and one for the user/instance defined blocks.\n\n\n\nAlso, it means that sticky blocks are always at the top.  We had imagined that in any case. Otherwise, merging user-defined order and admin-defined order is a nightmare. In fact, any way you deal with it, merging is a nightmare. Say that the user makes four blocks on each side, each one to four. Then the admin comes along and defines four new blocks on each side, order one to four. How do you define what the merged order is? You can't - it's best to put the admin ones at the top.\n\nFrom Martin Langhoff (martin at catalyst.net.nz) Friday,  11 February 2005, 09:51 AM:\n\nJon - it's not about the database crashing. It's about unacceptable performance.\n\n\n\nGood RDBMSs scale incredibly well if you use them smartly. A small table, or a special record type, can save us reading and writing thousands of duplicate lines in this case. \n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Friday,  11 February 2005, 10:15 AM:\n\nThis last suggestion is definitely a better prospect, I have to say.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I 'll continue with my job of being the devil's advocate. Don't shoot me. :)\n\n\n\nFirst off, merging isn't a problem if they are all in the same table. Just put them at the bottom and let the user move them around as he wants.\n\n\n\nNow, some problems that I can still think of:\n\n\n\n1. How do you propose to handle multiple pinned instances of the same block in the same page? This includes letting the admin configure them (and blocklib working eveything out).\n\n\n\n2. If the admin has an unpinned block and pins it, it's going to jump around in his page. OK, that's acceptable. But what do we do if he unpins a pinned block? Not allowed? Delete only?\n\n\n\n3. This is going to make a mess of blocklib (sigh).\n\n\n\nI 'll keep thinking more about all this.\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Friday,  11 February 2005, 10:34 AM:\n\n> First off, merging isn't a problem if they are all in\n\n> the same table. Just put them at the bottom and let \n\n> the user move them around as he wants.\n\n\n\nYes, but that hinges on having copies. If we don't have copies, the user can't move them. I tend to like this approach more, because I can't see any way of letting users move the admin defined blocks around *other than* having copies. \n\n\n\n> 1. How do you propose to handle multiple pinned \n\n> instances of the same block in the same page? This \n\n> includes letting the admin configure them (and \n\n> blocklib working eveything out).\n\n\n\nWell, you'd just have two entries with the same block instanceid in the block_defaults table... wrt configured blocks like the html block, you're already storing the config in the block_instance table, so if it's a pinned block, it goes in the blocks_default table, with the config setting and gets displayed as normal. If it's the html block, we put two entries in with the same blockid but different configdata.\n\n\n\n2. If the admin has an unpinned block and pins it, it's going to jump around in his page. OK, that's acceptable. But what do we do if he unpins a pinned block? Not allowed? Delete only?\n\n\n\nJust delete the record from the blocks_default table. If a user really wants it they can always add it again.\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Friday,  11 February 2005, 10:43 AM:\n\nalso,\n\n\n\n> 3. This is going to make a mess of blocklib (sigh).\n\n\n\nwhy? we don't need to change that much - I already made a function to get default blocks then users blocks (assuming our original approach) that I can easily change for this new approach. maybe blocks_get_by_page can call blocks_get_default($page) first and then add the page ones to the bottom of the default ones.\n\n\n\nthen we need two new actions in blocks_execute_action is it? pin - which adds an entry to the defaults table, and unpin, which removes the entry from the defaults table and adds it to the admin's own view, I guess.\n\n\n\nthen we need to change the function that sets up the allowed actions to add pin and unpin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Monday,  14 February 2005, 08:53 AM:\n\nOn Friday before we left I wrote the necessary code to make a user page that had the ability to add blocks (using standard blocklib functionality). All I have left to do is the stickyblock part. And I really need to get onto it because we have a deadline for a demo :o\n\n\n\nIs everyone happy if I follow the route of a new table called block_default? \n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Monday,  14 February 2005, 09:35 AM:\n\nFurther info\n\n\n\nprefix_block_default\n\n - id\n\n - blockid\n\n - pagetype\n\n - position\n\n - weight\n\n - configdata\n\n\n\nWe don't need 'visible' flag - either they're pinned or they're not. pageid is gone because they're for all pages of that pagetype.   Other than those two, it's the same as prefix_block_instance.\n\n\n\nThe only thing I'm not sure of is the name. It's not really default, because default implies something that's there automatically until you change it.  Maybe prefix_block_pinned?  \n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Monday,  14 February 2005, 09:56 AM:\n\nI believe we analyzed this quite thoroughly.\n\n\n\n1. pinned column DRAWBACKS:\n\n\n\n* Many more rows into mdl_block_instance. Maybe that will slow the db down in SELECTs (we do have indexes on the WHERE fields, however).\n\n* Pinning a block might turn out to be expensive. Worst case scenario, as many INSERTs as unique pages where that block was not present before the pinning.\n\n* Configuring/unpinning/deleting a pinned block will require a UPDATE/DELETE ... WHERE ... (will process many rows)\n\n\n\n2. mdl_block_pinned (agree with the name) DRAWBACKS:\n\n\n\n* Increase in code complexity because we have to handle a special case.\n\n* One extra SELECT required to display ALL pages, even if noone has pinned any block anywhere.\n\n* Loss of uniformity in the UI for everyone (cannot move or unpin pinned blocks, must delete and add new instead).\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThat said, I simply regard those last three more serious than the first. They apply to all users everywhere, while the other case will only affect REALLY big installations (and it's unknown how much they will be affected). IMHO, those installations can (and should) simply add more horsepower if required. You can't expect to run a large university's site on the same machine I run my test install.\n\n\n\nSo until new data come to light, I still vote for #1. Sorry, but that's my opinion.\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Monday,  14 February 2005, 10:38 AM:\n\n* Loss of uniformity in the UI for everyone (cannot move or unpin pinned blocks, must delete and add new instead).\n\n\n\nI've been thinking about this and it makes sense to me that administrators have a separate interface to configure pinned blocks away from their own views of things.  Imagine the following.\n\n\n\nAn admin user is looking at their my moodle page, moving the blocks around, playing a bit, and they accidently click on the pin icon on the bottom left side.  Page reloads and it has jumped to the top, and they can't move it back. Suddenly all the users logged in see this block appear. Maybe it's an RSS feed from the admin user's best friend's blog.  Not so good.\n\n\n\nIf, off the admin screen, we have a new menu item called 'Configure pinned blocks', or off the blocks admin page, or whatever, they pick the pagetype they want to configure and can pin, unpin, move up and down, until their hearts content and it will separate things from their own view screen.\n\n\n\nFrom Martin Langhoff (martin at catalyst.net.nz) Monday,  14 February 2005, 10:55 AM:\n\nWe are trying to come up with a schema that works for all of us, and I think that -- working together -- we can find a design that meets all the requirements, and works well in all points of the scalability spectrum. \n\n\n\nI need you to trust us a bit on database scalability, though. \n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Monday,  26 June 2006, 10:37 AM:\n\nWas it fixed in 1.6?\n\nFrom   (penny at catalyst.net.nz) Monday,  26 June 2006, 10:44 AM:\n\nnicole - there are sticky blocks in 1.6, configurable off a new page from the admin screen.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Tuesday,  27 June 2006, 12:35 AM:\n\nClosing it then.

      "09/Feb/05 7:15 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 08:10 AM:\n\nI think it's easy to implement this using the highlight() function. Assuming that we don't indicate we want to search html tags (default), just run every initially matching post through highlight(), asking that all search terms be tagged with some nonsensical css label. Discard all posts which  come back without this nonsensical label (which indicates the search terms only occur within html tags).  Then replace the nonsensical css tag with highlight.  I'll take a crack at this tonight.\n\n\n\nThe only question I have is how should we indicate to the search function to look within html tags?  How about using the syntax <html> in the search phrase to indicate this option?\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 08:19 AM:\n\nWhoops!  I meant to say using the syntax <html> in the search phrase to indicate this option? \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday, 7 February 2005, 09:29 AM:\n\nIf something like this was added it should follow the new syntax we are using in search, eg:\n\n\n\n   html:table\n\n\n\nDoing it in highlight sounds ugly and will give problems with paging etc ... it should be done in the database by the new search lexer we have since that's what it's good at ... see lib/searchlib.php\n\nFrom Tony Hursh (hursh at uiuc.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 09:39 AM:\n\nI think it won't be a problem to do this (should be just a matter of ginning up the proper regexes). I may not be able to get to it for a little bit, though.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 10:07 AM:\n\nMartin, I'm afraid my SQL skills are not up to the task.\n\n\n\nIn any case, the default should be NOT to search within html tags. Maybe I am being a little dense, but I can't think of any regexp which will find a search term which is guaranteed to be OUTSIDE an html tag. (It's no problem to find one for searching INSIDE html tags.) All the solutions I coud find on the web and usenet for dealing with this recommended stripping out the all html tags and then searching within the remaining text. Since highlight() already does this, why not reuse the code?\n\n\n\nPaging would not be a problem, since the idea would be to discard the unwanted posts from the preliminary array of matching posts before they are sent to the pager.\n\nFrom Tony Hursh (hursh at uiuc.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 10:39 AM:\n\nSurely we don't want to exclude everything that's inside of *any* HTML tag (what about paragraph or formatting tags, like bold face and italic)?    I would guess that you'd want to exclude stuff that shows up in href, div and span, but not b, i, p, or table.  Any others come to mind?\n\n\n\nI haven't looked at this at all yet, but if you have a regex that matches  instances inside of the offending tags, and one that matches instances anywhere, it'd be easy enough to generate the instances that aren't inside of tags. That's what AND NOT is for. :-)\n\n\n\nLots-o-reading to do for school, I'll get back on this later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Tony Hursh (hursh at uiuc.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 10:59 AM:\n\nWhoops, just realized that I was misinterpreting what it means to be in an HTML tag. I was thinking of all the text between the opening tag and the matching closing tag, but it's  now clear that you mean between the opening and closing bracket of a tag. Sorry! \n\n\n\nStill, I think this can be done with AND NOT, assuming that a more elegant regex doesn't come to mind.\n\n\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 11:09 AM:\n\nYes, that's what I meant by outside/inside a tag. Sorry for being unclear.\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm way off the mark, but I think AND NOT would not work.  For suppose a search term occured both outside and inside an html tag (in the sense above).  Then wouldn't AND NOT exclude the post? But we would NOT want to exclude such a post. If the search term occurs anywhere outside html tags, it should be included, even if the search term also occurs within some html tag.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Monday, 7 February 2005, 11:23 AM:\n\nThe paging doesn't work like that ... it gets the right subsection of records from the database ... if we have to get all 30000 posts from the database into memory and THEN parse them all with highlight to find the 10 in the middle that we want it will cause performance problems ... this gets repeated everytime they flip to a new page in the results ... \n\n\n\nThere's probably less direct ways to get around this, but I would prefer that we are sure there is not an SQL solution first ...\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 11:49 AM:\n\nMartin, I am not all suggesting getting all bazillion posts in the database into memory.  What I am suggesting, is to use the existing SQL search mechanism to find all posts matching the search terms anywhere in the text (including inside tags), then using highlight() to discard those in which the search text only occurs within html tags (unless otherwise specified by the html: prefix).\n\n\n\nMore precisely, I would extract all the html:blah1 html:blah2 html:blah3 ... search terms into a temporary array.  Then I would remove all the html: prefixes from the search terms and use the existing SQL search mechanism to find all posts matching the search terms anywhere. Then I would ask highlight() to mark up all the matching search terms with something like\n\n<span class= askldjaskldj >matching search term</span class=askldjaskldj>\n\n\n\nThen I would search the text return by highlight() for\n\n[whitespace](askldjaskldj/blah1/blah2/blah3/..)[whitespace]. If it didn't match, I would discard the post from the array of matching posts. After that I would replace askldjaskldj\n\nby highlight. I wouldn't need to call highlight again.\n\n\n\nThis COULDN'T be more inefficient than the present search mechanism, as it would start with the results returned by the present SQL search, then discard some of them.\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 12:03 PM:\n\nLet me just add that I didn't mention some other special cases that need to be considered.  We also don't want to discard returned posts which matched user:blah or subject:blahblah. Still I don't think that would be too bad to deal with.\n\nFrom Tony Hursh (hursh at uiuc.edu) Monday, 7 February 2005, 11:51 PM:\n\nMaybe a generalized solution to this would be a post-processing step involving preg_match. One could strip HTML tags and then check to see if the posts retrieved via SQL still matched (similar to what you're suggesting with highlight, but more general).\n\n\n\nOf course, this would slow things down a bit, but the advantage here is that the preg_match stuff could  be reused for searching things that aren't in the SQL database at all (e.g., uploaded files or linked resources). \n\n\n\nI probably won't have time to think about this seriously until next weekend.\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Tuesday, 8 February 2005, 01:00 AM:\n\nMartin, I'm sorry I was confused about the paging.  I've attached a proposed solution.\n\n\n\nThe search is done as currently. However posts which match only within brackets of an HTML tag, have their body replaced with a message reporting this.  There is also a switch in the search terms [html] for turning off this behavior (in which case the search behaves exactly like it does currently).\n\n\n\nThe attachment is for version 1.4.3, since I needed to test it on our live courses which have a sufficient number of posts to enable testing.\n\n\n\nI accidentally also attached this to an unrelated bug. Sorry about that - please delete.\n\n\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Tuesday, 8 February 2005, 03:01 AM:\n\nI think I have it! Under the current circumstances I think the best thing to do would be to not modify the search at all.  Instead if a search returns posts where as search term occurs only within the brackets of an HTML tag, there should be a line added to the top of such a post saying: The following search terms only occur within the HTML markup of this post: blah1 blah2 ...\n\nThis line should be distinctively styled from the rest of the post.\n\n\n\nThis would be similar to what Google does:\n\nThese terms only appear in links pointing to this page:  blah1 blah2 ....\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Tuesday, 8 February 2005, 06:09 AM:\n\nOK, I've attached a second version which implements the above proposal (again for version 1.4.3).\n\n\n\nMartin, what do you think?\n\nFrom Zbigniew Fiedorowicz (fiedorow at math.ohio-state.edu) Tuesday, 8 February 2005, 11:15 PM:\n\nUnless I hear any objections from Martin or Tony, I'll check a slightly improved version of this into CVS later today or tomorrow.\n\n\n\nI don't think it's feasible to do a reliable and quick SQL search for terms which are guaranteed to be outside HTML markup, unless one prestores plaintext versions of each post in the database along with the HTML versions. I don't think a need for such searches is widespread enough to justify the storage and setup time costs for making such a change in the database. If I am wrong about this and some SQL regexp genius figures out some way to do this with the existing database setup, the changes I am making are modest enough that it should not be a big burden to undo them and replace them with the new code.",

    "Description": "On the course home page the groups icons after activities and resources should only be shown if the corresponding activity or resource actually knows about groups.\n\n\n\nOriginally I had this implemented by setting an entry in an array $CFG->usesgroups in the lib.php for each module that knows about groups. As Martin pointed out this would not work unless all lib.php are loaded on the course homepage. This is of course the case when the recent activity block is there but it may not always be true.\n\n\n\nMartin's proposal was to put the info into the course->modinfo by letting each group-aware module return an extra property $info->usesgroups in its modulename_get_coursemodule_info() function. This would then be built into the modinfo cache by the function get_array_of_activities. This would work but the drawback is that the modinfo cache would grow. The information on whether a module is groups-aware would be duplicated for each instance of the module.\n\n\n\nThe most straightforward option would be to store the information in an extra field in the modules table. Its drawback is that it allows only one setting for all resource types. If some resource types implement groups but others don't then this won't work.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother scheme would be to simply set course_modules->groupmode to -1 if the module does not support groups. This could easily be done but the drawback is that when the module then becomes group-aware the developer might forget to set the groupmode for existing coursemodules back to the course default. Perhaps not really a problem, after all the developer will quickly notice the problem. I think I like this option.",

So putting a special mechanism in place for hiding the groups icons seems unnecessary. I now simply told Moodle 1.5 explicitly to not show groups icons for resources and labels.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Sunday,  19 February 2006, 09:10 AM:\n\nI know it can be a quick-fix solution (if we want to implement it) but it will break modularity for contrib modules.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday,  19 February 2006, 03:33 PM:\n\nHi Eloy, you submitted your comment at 2:10am your time, very late. I think you weren't quite so awake :-)\n\n\n\nThe feature WAS implemented and no, it does not affect contrib modules. It only affects resources and labels which are already treated separately from usual modules by the core code in that they are added with a different drop down menu.\n\n\n\nAnyway, this bug is closed, I have withdrawn my original feature request.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Sunday,  19 February 2006, 05:18 PM:\n\nYep, I was absolutely sleepy (they were my last words before going to sleep) :-D\n\n\n\nI didn't know it was implemented, nice. Although I continue thinking it isn't the perfect solution, and the modinfo addenda and so on (as specified above) would be the 100% proper solution. This will allow every module to decide if it has to have associated group icons or not, leaving the core free of exceptions (I know it isn't the only one exception currently present but I'm not really sure that it was one excuse to add more of them).\n\n\n\nAnyway, if this is closed, this is closed. Sure that we can modify such type of things in the future...\n\n\n\nCiao :-)",

Voy a echar un vistazo al m&#243;dulo SCORM para ver lo que hace pero jurar&#237;a que no tendr&#237;an que ser enlazados nunca!\n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\nFrom David Puente (dpuenteb at terra.es) Monday,  14 February 2005, 06:41 PM:\n\nI'm sure, they are linked!\n\nSpanish: Estoy seguro! ;-)\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Saturday,  19 February 2005, 07:54 AM:\n\nHi David,\n\n\n\nbeing a bit more exact, when you talk about 'terms are linked to the glossary', where are such terms? In the SCORM 'navigation' menu or inside contents (html pages)?\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Friday,  22 July 2005, 07:46 AM:\n\nAny news here? Closing if nothing arrive in some days... ;-)\n\nFrom David Puente (dpuenteb at terra.es) Friday,  22 July 2005, 02:30 PM:\n\nInside content. Thanks!\n\nFrom David Puente (dpuenteb at terra.es) Friday,  22 July 2005, 08:05 PM:\n\nIf the glossary terms has been inserted before uploading the Scorm file, these are linked. If you define those terms, and the Scorm file has been already uploaded, it does not recognize the definitons in the glossary.\n\n\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Friday,  22 July 2005, 08:18 PM:\n\nUhm...\n\n\n\njust moving this to Bobo, because I cannot imagine any reason for the glossary filter to work differently depending of the moment terms are created.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the SCORM module, on load, does the linking work? Bobo?",

    "Description": "I had a look at the en_us language pack and found that it duplicates a lot of the strings that are already in the en pack. Is there a need for this? The advantage of avoiding duplication is that changes in the parent language are immediately reflected in the child and also the language pack is smaller.\n\n\n\nUnless there are good reasons for the duplication I would like to remove it from the en_us pack.",

      "09/Jul/08 5:35 PM;557058:ad4396bc-c0c2-4271-b0a9-df80010113dc;Laia - I was thinking today actually as I was going through the course listing that it would be helpful to adjust the number of course per page. Of course this is totally possible; however, it is a setting listed under front page settings which does not seem to me to be the most intuitive place for it. I would expect it to be somewhere under courses but the argument could be made that you really only browse courses from the front page. Everywhere else you are in a particular course. In any case, this might be a neat area to explore using AJAX. For me the larger question is how does Moodle handle long lists. There should be an option for # of entries per page, ways of sorting and filtering, etc. A comparison of the various long lists (courses, students, participants, questions, etc.) would be good to have. Do each of them function is a similar way? If not, what are the difference and are they justified? Peace - Anthony",

Without it teachers of individual classes cannot create their own activities without those activities being availabe in all class-views = groups. \n\n\n\nIdeally the groups in which an activity appears would be semi-automatic, depending upon the groups in which the activity creator is a member. \n\nFrom John Ryan (johnlawrenceryan at hotmail.com) Monday,  21 February 2005, 04:18 AM:\n\nIt would also be useful if the groups functionality could also work in the gradebook.  Its useful for teachers to be able to see the assignments only for their own group.

I just changed the longtimenosee setting on the Moodle for Langauge Teaching site [Course Admin > Users > User Enrollment > Self-enrollment]. Now we can build up our list of language teachers and send out bi-annual announcements to our infrequent visitors. \nIt also goes to show that with patience, the Tracker and our Moodle HQ staff will deal with requests on a systematic basis. Even though this took more than eight years to implement, it was never deleted, never forgotten, and gives me faith in the system."

This is because the html editor will not allow you to make a link to nothing.

I know it won't allow for pausing the clips, but in some cases (such as my site) the clips used are so short so that having pause capabilities isn't really necessary, if not actually confusing.",

It's clearly stated in the section that these links should lead to the \"Course profile\" information. This provides an easier access to the \"Course profile\" information, has been incorporated into Moodle core for quite a while and probably there are users that rely on it. \r\n\r\nAdding a link to the course itself changes the whole functionality of the \"Course profiles\" section, which I don't think it's a proper solution.\r\n\r\nThis should probably be discussed in the forum.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nMihail.",

Instead, it would be great if site and course profiles could one day be improved."

Just working on it...\n\n\n\nPS: Martin, I was using the email_to_user() function with the $from->customheaders trick to add an X-Priority: 2 header when I've detected that phpmailer class always set such header, so TWO headers are sent if I manually add other. Alternatives are:\n\n\n\n- Modify email_to_user() with a new parameter (default to 3-normal) to set the priority.\n\n- Modify email_to_user() to use a new $from->priority field to set the priority.\n\n- Modify the phpmailer class to avoid sending the priority by default so it only will be sent adding it to $from->customheaders\n\n\n\nBoth 1 and 2 seems to be better (phpmailer not modified). Any comment?\n\n\n\nCiao :-)\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday, 3 March 2005, 01:03 AM:\n\nCool!

This is the link to the forum where I attempt to detail the feature. \n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=19060&parent=90520\n\n\n\nsubcategories are cool for keeping things in order, but this FEATURE REQUEST would save time. \n\n\n\nPerhaps there are other standard ways that people use quiz question subcategories. \n\n\n\nOne might imagine the case where instead of variations on a theme (as I use) the subcategories contain alternate quizes.\n\n\n\nIn that case, the random button would be better provided with a check box to say, (not to a one from each category but) use one subcategory in its entirety.",
      "24/Aug/06 1:06 PM;712020:6373ec6e-2a10-4a86-9493-052782609013;I just got a message saying that work on this feature request had stopped. My guess is that it had not started, so I guess that perhaps \"work has stopped\" may mean that the feature request has been deemed not worth starting? \n\nIf so I feel that it would be a shame since I would still like this one. \n\nI think that a lot of people use the \"random question\" feature as an aid to help prevent cheating.\n\nIf the teacher is really energetic then all the questions may be completely different.\n\nBut as suggestedon the forums, for the stake of reducing the incidence of cheating, and without forcing the teacher to write completely new questions, it is often enough to simply change the wording of the question or the responses. These variations will be kept in a sub category. \n\n",

When all the bugs were transferred from the old bug tracker to the new one, they all came over with status 'In progress'. I am sorry, I cannot work on 194 bugs all at once, so I had to mass move the all back to 'Open'.\n\nIn future, when I move a bug to 'In progress', then it will mean something.\n\nThis is a good feature suggestion, but not easy, so it won't happen any time soon.",

      "10/Mar/16 12:54 AM;557058:5188c7d7-5671-48d1-b501-6c3ae2b91f34;Thank you very much for working on this. It is a useful option to add. However, there are a few issues with the current patch.\r\n\r\nA) My main concern about this is usability. You want this functionality, and you understand what you want. Therefore you understand what clicking the new button will do. I worry that a teacher who has never thought about this option will not understand it. (Random questions already confuse users, judging by the number of questions we get in the quiz forum.)\r\n\r\n# I suggest you add a screen-grab of the dialogue with your change to the forum thread https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=321161.\r\n\r\n(Examples of other threads where this sort of consultation was done: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=327631 or https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=327625.)\r\n\r\nB) Some more minor usability concerns:\r\n\r\n# I do not think the change to 'Add random question(s)' is an improvement. I think it looks ugly. (This would be another thing where it is good to ask for opinions in the forum thread.)\r\n# Thinking about Test 2 in the testing instructions. It is not great to have a button which, when you click it, does nothing. It should be possible to add some disabledIf rules to the form, so that the button is only enabled if you have selected a category with subcategories (https://docs.moodle.org/dev/lib/formslib.php_Form_Definition#disabledIf)\r\n\r\nC) There is a bug. This change breaks the $data->newcategory case. \r\n\r\n# Please fix.\r\n\r\nD) Automated testing: it should not be possible to introduce a regression like C) because the automated tests should detect it. However https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/83a951023eca8d0a60fa18efbb94a6d24f9641a4/mod/quiz/tests/behat/editing_add.feature does not cover that case. (It should.)\r\n\r\nAlso, please do not look at that file ;-) It is a really bad example of how to write Behat tests. A better example is https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/83a951023eca8d0a60fa18efbb94a6d24f9641a4/mod/quiz/tests/behat/editing_section_headings.feature. (It is better because: it uses proper set-up methods, and it breaks down the functionality into separate scenarios that each test just one thing.)\r\n\r\n# Please at least add a new scenario to editing_add.feature to test you functionality you have added.\r\n# Please write that new scenario by following a good example test, not a bad one.\r\n# Although it is not really you responsibility, it would be really good if you could also add a scenario for the $data->newcategory case. (That would help verify that you have really fixed the issue that your patch introduced.)\r\n# Another thing that is not your responsibility, but it would be really good if you had time to work on:   re-write the existing scenarios in editing_add.feature so that all the scenarios in there are good.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work on this. I hope it does not take too long to address these issues.",

I think the UI is OK now.\r\n\r\nReviewing it, I just noticed these minor points (the list has grown quite long, but many of them are minor):\r\n\r\n# You can do this query with get_records, rather than get_records SQL https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...duke00787:MDL-2689#diff-8e3388d14af5c35aa4af26335d80d7a5R96.\r\n# I think you should specify a definite sort order (which should be 'sortorder, name', like get_categories_for_contexts), otherwise the order of things added to the quiz will be random.\r\n# I don't think this code https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...duke00787:MDL-2689#diff-d11364fd0e951ccbaf61fd967d86c36aR64 should be inline in the definition method. It is quite specific to this form, so I suggest a new method (suggested name protected function get_categories_without_subcategories) in the form class.\r\n# Moodle code style for SQL is strange (https://docs.moodle.org/dev/SQL_coding_style) but it would be better if you could follow it.\r\n# No very good reason ot use array_map. A boring for loop would probably be easier to understand.\r\n# Would be be possible to do this without another database query? It would be a bit hacky, but basically you would need to loop through $usablecontexts, and get options where the next option is more indented than this one. Is that a good idea?\r\n# Typo $categorieswithousubcategories. Should be  $categorieswithou*t*subcategories\r\n# Help strings are treated as Markdown, so you don't need the <p> tags. They will be added because you have a blank line.\r\n# Would be better to say 'click' instead of 'push button' (twice).\r\n# I do not understand why the new CSS rule is necessary. If it is needed, please add a comment, and move it close to the other edit page style rules, rather than putting it at the end. If it is not needed, please remove. (I only tested in Firefox, but it seems to have no effect.)\r\n# Please name the new Behat file editing_add_random.feature, so that it close to the other similar tests in order.\r\n# No real benefit in separating the Behat tests and the code into two separate commits. Better to squash them. (Please rebase onto latest master at the same time.)\r\n# Ideally, write some manual test instructions. They can be very short, but a human should look at this.

Duke - actually, you example contains necessary information in '_path' fields - you can see that one is '/1/3/21' and the other is '/1/3/21/23', which means second is a children of first. However, this would make code more complex and we already have one negative example in MDL-20153 where Tim asked to get data from the particular function, then wrote that resulting code was \"too complex\" for the problem it solves (the original solution was much easier). So Tim - please answer on 6 - do you really want this increase in complexity of code with possible additional problems in them, so the code will wait another year? This is quiz editing, not attempting, so I guess performance is not paramaunt there.\r\n\r\nP.S. Tim, it also would be actually good to hear at last you opinion on how we should do MDL-20153. We implemented simple solution, you asked us to use another function and this results in more complex one due to very inconvenient way of getting necessary information from this function output. You wrote that new code is too complex. But you still not say can we return to previous simple solution abandoning recommended function or how otherwise to simplify that code. I can't request peer review on that issue without code and you ignored several questions in this issue since it is in \"development state\". Can we break this stalemate somehow?",

      "19/Jan/18 12:46 AM;62b96026fa171a27239c3e14;Hi everybody, it's a pity this very old issue still going on without a resolution.\r\n\r\nI have read previous comments, reviewed the code and played a bit with the patch. Sorry, but it is clear this issue is not ready to be sent for integration review.\r\n\r\nAs Tim commented, the UI part of this patch definitely needs more love. I have discussed about it with my team mate [~accountid:5f86a7157441ea00681880f5] and we think that adding a new button on that modal will make things more confusing for teachers. For instance, imagine a teacher opening that modal and seeing a checkbox \"Include questions from subcategories too\" and a wide button \"Add random question from each subcategory of this category\"... that's very confusing for the end user, we tend to look things with our developer point of view, but we should try to simplify things to users not familiar with moodle and computers.\r\n\r\nNow, about the code:\r\nh6. mod/quiz/addrandomform.php\r\n # The get_categories_without_subcategories() method seems wrongly placed. You put that function inside a mform file, and it is very clear that function should be placed somewhere inside the question API's.\r\n # Pretty sure you could change [this line|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...duke00787:MDL-2689#diff-d11364fd0e951ccbaf61fd967d86c36aR139], assigning the index of {{$optionsvalue}} to the category id, something like this:\r\n{code}foreach ($categorieswithoutsubcategories as $category) {\r\n\t$optionsvalue[$category->id] = $category->contextid;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nAnd if decide to move this function to question API's, please rename that function to something like {{$result}} or so.\r\n\r\nh6. mod/quiz/addrandom.php\r\n # I think if you optimise the code above, you maybe can get rid of this bunch of exploding, your patch explodes the same variable twice, a clear indication that the code needs to be more well structured.\r\n # Another thing that caught my attention, it [loops through each subcategory|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...duke00787:MDL-2689#diff-8e3388d14af5c35aa4af26335d80d7a5R101], calling quiz_add_random_questions()}} for each subcategory. Looking the code of that function seems a bit expensive to be called inside a loop and can cause perfomance regressions.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't think we should implement this feature, this issue has been created almost *13 years ago and since then collected only 7 votes*.\r\nUnless we get more votes here, it's unlikely it's going to be prioritised anytime soon.\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry, but I'm reopening this issue at this point.",

Maybe in /lib?\n\nFrom Dmitry Pupinin (dlnsk at nspu.ru) Thursday,  24 March 2005, 05:35 PM:\n\nMartin, what are you think about charset depended encode/decode function?\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Friday,  22 April 2005, 11:45 AM:\n\nIs this the same issue as my MDL-2503? Have to research.\n\nFrom Dmitry Pupinin (dlnsk at nspu.ru) Friday,  22 April 2005, 12:50 PM:\n\nYes, Martin. Is fixed for windows-1251 (see attachment) and may be used for any charset by adding file with encode/decode function.\n\nFrom Hiroto Kagotani (kagotani at cne.okayama-u.ac.jp) Friday,  13 May 2005, 05:16 PM:\n\nPJ, Yes.\n\n\n\nThis issue and MDL-2503 are essentially the same.  Further, not only RSS feed but almost all of the XML file importing/exporting have the same problem.\n\n\n\nOne of my idea is giving langage pack creators a chance to define their utf8_encode and utf8_decode -like functions, and replace all utf8_{en,de}code with them.  Replacing can be done by using variables $utf8_encode and $utf8_decode containing the new function names and are defaulted to the original function names.\n\n\n\nFor example at the bottom of lib/setup.php:\n\n$utf8_encode = 'utf8_encode';\n\n$utf8_decode = 'utf8_decode';\n\n$charset_setup_file = $CFG->dirroot.'/lang/'.current_language().'/lib/charset.php';\n\nif (file_exists($charset_setup_file)) {\n\n    require_once($charset_setup_file);\n\n}\n\n\n\nThen, all utf8_encode and utf8_decode can be safely replaced with $utf8_encode and $utf8_decode with a declaration of global $utf8_{en,de}code;\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFrom Dmitry Pupinin (dlnsk at nspu.ru) Friday,  15 July 2005, 02:54 PM:\n\nI made that kagotani was suggested with small changes.\n\nSee 151_utf8_global_patch.zip\n\n\n\nIt's ready for use with any XMLs.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday,  23 January 2006, 08:19 AM:\n\nHey,\n\n\n\nall this should be solved in next 1.6 release (where everything would run under UTF-8). The main problem is that, if aren't 100% sure that the DB is set to UTF-8 we cannot guaranty in which encoding every user has written each content so, any conversion strategy would, potentially, fail.\n\n\n\nThe upgrade to 1.6 will include a full migration of DB to UTF-8 (analysing each content, his 'owner' and his original encoding). Once converted, life will be really easier for all those import/exports and so on...\n\n\n\nHow this sound for you?\n\nFrom Dmitry Pupinin (dlnsk at nspu.ru) Monday,  23 January 2006, 01:30 PM:\n\nI was hear about 1.6.\n\nThat's really good!\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Monday,  10 April 2006, 07:23 AM:\n\nI'll mark this as closed in some days because Moodle 1.6 running against UTF-8 databases should solve this for ever.",

We certainly want that functionality.\n\n\n\nThe Replace in feature is only there if the question is being used in some quizzes already. We certainly want to tell the teacher about this and also need to know which quizzes he wants to change and which ones to keep.\n\n\n\nIf there are no attempts at a question in a quiz then the Replace box is automatically checked.\n\n\n\nSo I don't see how we could improve on this any further.\n\nFrom Eloy Lafuente (stronk7 at moodle.org) Thursday,  17 March 2005, 04:19 PM:\n\nAh, now I see how the Save as new question works.\n\n\n\nI thought it was showed together with the Replace in, but it's showed always any question is being edited (updated). And it has sense. Only the position of the button is, then, debatable.\n\n\n\nThe need to move it from its current position is increased because, in conjunction with the replace in, can be (at least for me) a bit confusing.... To see the replace check marked impels to press the save as a new question, whereas the meaning of the save question seems to leave everything in the same question (and this isn't the actual behaviour).\n\n\n\nAnd, about the replace in option, instead of to show it once the question has been added why not to show it only if the question has been really used in any attempt? There isn't need to create versions if nobody has used the old one!\n\n\n\nSincerely, I've spent sometime to discover how each option works and it'll produce a lot of problems to teachers with its current implementation (duplicating questions without need, not replacing questions when they are trying to do it...).\n\n\n\nSummarising, this is the list of suggested changes:\n\n\n\n- Show only the replace in block if the question has been used in attempts (default to not replace = create new version).\n\n- Move the duplicate question button from its current location. Alternatives could be:\n\n+ A new location in the same page.\n\n+ A new duplicate icon in the edit questions page near each question.\n\n+ A duplicate button in the edit questions page, working like the delete selected  one.\n\n\n\nOnly my personal thoughts....ciao :-)\n\n\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday,  17 March 2005, 10:54 PM:\n\nI think this needs to be discussed in the forums. I have posted at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=20437.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 4 June 2005, 06:20 PM:\n\nJust copying in Julian so that we can take Eloy's interface ideas into account when re-enabling the versioning code.",

However, this has led to students printing the feedback\n\nscreens so that they can remember which items they got wrong or right.\n\nI realise that there is a good pedagogic argument for making students\n\nremember and also work out which items are wrong and right, but when\n\nstudents are left to their own devices they choose the easiest way,\n\nwhich is to waste loads of paper. It would be wonderful if this feature\n\nwas reactivated, or even better, made an option in the Quiz setup page;\n\ne.g.: [Show item score in second or more attempts: yes or no].",

However, as this is a form element we can only logically display one of them (otherwise the value of the upper one won't matter because it'll be overwritten by the bottom one on submission).  The second call to quiz_print_navigation_panel in quiz_print_quiz_questions (locallib.php ~1055) should be removed.\n\n\n\nThe quiz_print_navigation_panel has to be called before the question is printed and thus the select box ends up being displayed above the question when really it ought to be displayed next to the submit button.  \n\n\n\nTo this end I've made a second version of quiz_print_navigation_panel which returns a 2 index array consisting of [0] => $navigation and [1]=>$nav_select_box and DOES NOT print out the select box.  This allows me to hold the nav element until later where I echo it next to the submit box.\n\n\n\nIn this version the final two lines of the new version of quiz_print_navigation_panel should be replaced with\n\n\n\n//don't echo out the $nav_str\n\nreturn array($navigation, $nav_str\n\n\n\n\n\nThis in turn effects quiz_print_quiz_questions.....\n\n\n\n// first call ~1004\n\n\n\n        list($navigation, $nav_widget) = quiz_print_navigation_panel($questions,\n\n                $quiz->questionsperpage, $navigation);\n\n\n\n//we now have the navigation select box stored in $nav_widget\n\n......\n\n/*\n\n~1046 we remove the second call to print the navigation as before and replace it as follows\n\n*/\n\n  if($navigation)\n\n {\n\n  echo $nav_widget; //print list of nav options.\n\n }\n\n else\n\n {\n\n  echo <input type=\\hidden\\ name=\\navigation\\ value='0' />\\n;     //save == exit\n\n }\n\n\n\nThis code removes the javascript dependence for pagination of a quiz.  Tested with 1 q per page, 2 q per page and unlimited q per page.\n\n\n\nObviously, the quiz module is still highly dependent on JS but I'll continue to work to remove this if it's approved.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy apologies if this doesn't format properly.  It's my first post here and if it's not clear what I mean I'll post the full files.\n\nGav",

But for the quiz attempt page buttons would be better.\n\nFrom Govsan  (gavin at designiscentral.com) Thursday,  24 March 2005, 05:52 PM:\n\n>I don't think the links to pages should be replaced by a drop-down menu.

I'm aware that the quiz module still needs JS to work but these other dependencies could be removed as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n>next and previous links into buttons\n\n\n\nIMHO this would cause other problems.  Firstly, it means you can only navigate one step in either direction.  The can be very slow and frustrating.  You're on question 20 and you've just realised you made a mistake on question 5....\n\n\n\nSecond.  That give the user a choice of 3 submit buttons.  Certainly with the current solution I occasionally found myself exiting the quiz accidentally because I clicked 'save my answers' instead of moving to the next question.",

Teacher's don't need more work ...\n\nFrom   (moodle at martignoni.net) Tuesday, 5 April 2005, 04:48 PM:\n\nIn a ideal world, this is the perfect solution.\n\n\n\nBut with some very beginners it's really a pain to let them do the process, make them get their e-mail (if they manage to get it!), return to the moodle and finish the process. And the teacher HAS more work and it's very frustrating.\n\n\n\nThis is a problem particularly when using moodle in a real classroom. If you lose 10 minutes for the login, a 45 minutes lesson will possibly not go well.\n\n\n\nIt could be an option of the moodle to allow this.\n\nFrom jan dierckx (ja.di at pro.tiscali.be) Tuesday, 5 April 2005, 08:12 PM:\n\n'Initial value' might sound good when your students are just starting to use elearning, but I can't imagine resetting the password to it's initial value being a real solution. If they can't remember / write down somewhere the password of their email account, I doubt they will remember / find the initial password that was given to them let's say two years ago. According to me (I work with 12-20 year old) knowing about internet safety (remember passwords, make them safe, do not give them to others, ...) is part of the skills schools need to pass on nowadays. \n\nFrom   (moodle at martignoni.net) Wednesday, 6 April 2005, 01:55 AM:\n\nYou're maybe right. But it could be nevertheless an option for the teacher to reset the student course password to something else nevertheless.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday, 6 April 2005, 11:48 AM:\n\nNote also that admins can change the password simply by editing the profile ... so myabe you just need admin status\n\nFrom   (moodle at martignoni.net) Wednesday, 6 April 2005, 01:29 PM:\n\nYes, but I certainly don't want every teacher with admin status ;-)\n\n\n\nA solution could be to provide a way for the teacher to edit the profile of their students. This could be in certain environments a big plus, in particular if the students put some bad things (photo, etc.) in their profile.\n\n\n\nI'm well aware that this is not the case in many moodle sites, but could be very helpful in some institutions (K12 notably).",

A good solution, as commented above, could be to be able for teachers to edit the profile of their students. I'm noting that allowing the moodle/user:editprofile capability in the appropriate context, e.g. course, would seem a solution. As far as I understand it, this capability can be only given in context SYSTEM (see http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=66951). Any comment ?",

However the implementation should be done better (I can say that because I did it). The problem with the current code is that it is quite inconvenient when an option is added to the quiz module because this requires changes in several places. Instead I propose the following:\n\n\n\nThe options should be loaded into an array of objects with each object representing one option and containing the option text, the name of the option, the type of interaction needed to set it, and anything else that is needed to build the setup form. This array is then the only thing that needs to be changed when an option is added or removed. Both the admin page and the teacher option page is built using this array.",

So export now flattens them to a single line, which effectively solves the problem. I appreciate that this may not be what you want. I will close this and if it doesn't do, please re-open as a feature request for multi-line text in GIFT format.\n\nFrom Dmitry Pupinin (dlnsk at nspu.ru) Friday,  29 April 2005, 01:44 AM:\n\nWhat better do? Reopen this bug or create new?\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Friday,  29 April 2005, 04:01 AM:\n\nGIFT format is only specified for one line per question text. This is quite restrictive. Recommend making question import and export support multiple lines (escaping line breaks with \\n). Will also require an update of the GIFT documentation.\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Friday, 6 May 2005, 11:43 AM:\n\nDlnsk\n\n Can't you just use <br /> instead of /n?\n\nFrom Dmitry Pupinin (dlnsk at nspu.ru) Wednesday,  10 August 2005, 02:38 PM:\n\nFixed (see attachment).\n\nReturn carriage escaping by \\n\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Wednesday,  10 August 2005, 06:59 PM:\n\nPatch committed to CVS.

    "Description": "On many moodle pages the button at the bottom of the page functions as a save as well as continue button (at least one of the buttons at the bottom has this function). However when adding a category the add button is to the left of the new category. I find that I keep pressing the continue button expecting the category that i have entered be saved  when of course it is not. So I think it would be nice if there were a save and continue button at the bottom as well. Or perhaps just if the continue button functione in that way. \n\n\n\nI am trying again with 1.5.",

Can you tell me under what circumstances it happens? I just created a category with a leading 0 and it is not being stripped.\n\n2) The order of categories is not determined by their name but by the order chosen on the category edit page.\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Thursday,  14 April 2005, 08:18 PM:\n\nAha. The leading zeros are only stripped when the category name contains only digits. I think that this is simply a product of the way php interprets digit only strings - as numbers (I seem to remember reading somewhere). \n\n\n\nMy categories seem to default to an order determinied by their name. \n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday,  14 April 2005, 08:25 PM:\n\nMy categories seem to default to an order determinied by their name.\n\nAgain this is something I can not reproduce. And what do you mean by default to an order? Do you mean that when you add them they are initially placed in this order or do you mean that even after you order them in the way you want they do get reordered by their name?\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Thursday,  14 April 2005, 08:49 PM:\n\nFor example... since digit only categories have their leading zeros removed, I have been putting a p in front of the category names\n\np005\n\np006\n\nBut then I put some characters after then number e.g. \n\n007Variations_on_question2\n\nand found that if there were characters in the category name then the trailing zeros are not removed. Additionally since there is no 'p' this category floate to the top of the list of categories, like this:\n\n\n\n007Variations_on_question2\n\np005\n\np006\n\n\n\nThat is not what I wanted, so I added a p at the front of the this category name, and it resumed the place in the order that I wanted, like this\n\n\n\np005\n\np006\n\np007Variations_on_question2\n\n\n\nTim\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday,  14 April 2005, 10:07 PM:\n\nDid you actually see the up and down arrows on the category edit page for re-ordering categories?\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Thursday,  14 April 2005, 10:15 PM:\n\nYes, I can see the arrows. \n\nBut if one creates a new category, it seems to enter the table, by the alphanumeric order of its title. This is a boon since it avoids having to press the arrows (I will soon have a hundred categories). \n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday,  14 April 2005, 10:18 PM:\n\nIf you have so many categories I would recommend that you organize them in a hierarchy, making use of nested subcategories. That will also make it easier to move them around using the drop-down list for moving them to another category.\n\n\n\nCan this bug now be closed?\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Thursday,  14 April 2005, 10:42 PM:\n\nThis bug was REALLY minor. I am not sure it ever should have been opened. But I guess it remains, in its very minor way: it would be nice to be able to call a category 001. and not have that changed to 1.\n\n\n\nYes. I did want to use subcategories, and I will when I return to 1.5, but I thought that perhaps the use of sub-categories was causing my problems so I am not using them at the moment (I was yesterday, but even then I was calling categories using numerals for the chapters). The functionality provided by subcategories means that one is less likely to want to call a category 001.\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to close this if you wish. \n\n\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday,  24 April 2005, 02:45 AM:\n\nThis conversion is done in the moodle required_param() function which is part of the moodle security mechanism. While I don't quite see the need for this I think the issue is too minor to warrant an argument with the security people. So I am closing this.",

How could you possibly prevent copying of material from the screen? Even technology as old as the lead pencil can be used for copying.\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Thursday,  14 April 2005, 10:24 PM:\n\nThe new secure window function (paid for by my university), as well as opening the quiz in a new kiosk screen, adds javascript functionality to disable the copy paste functions in a variety of ways including by disabling right click. \n\n\n\nStudents can still, as you say\n\n1) Use a pencil\n\n2) Use their camera\n\n3) Access the cache of their browser\n\nBut they can not simply wave the moust accross the screen and press copy, and then paste the text into an email to their friend. \n\n\n\nThe secure window (note quotes) is not 100% by any means, but it makes it significantly more difficult to copy. \n\n\n\nAt the moment the javascript is only called in the quiz screen. I think that it would be a simple matter to call it from the feedback screen too.\n\n\n\nI have copied a lot of files from the quiz refactor to my desktop but I realise now just how many files there are in mod/quiz. I really need to install a cvs program. But is there any chance of a .zip (not gzip or tar) of the folder?\n\n\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday, 7 May 2005, 01:56 AM:\n\nFeedback screen now has the same protection as the attempt screen (at least once MDL-3146 is fixed)\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Saturday, 7 May 2005, 10:24 AM:\n\nThank you.",

When doing these things you get a sense of the small nuisances of repetative tasks. I'd put forth that whereever there is a drop-down (aka pull-down) menu with 3 or less items it be put out as radio buttons instead. For example, on a page like the forums, one might need to create 15 (one for each week) and all need the option each person posts one discussion. As a drop-down it take several actions to select a choice. As a radion button it's move and click. Tabs tend to be cumbersome because each help icon is tabbed, as is each toolbar item... so doing setups without the mouse is tough. As such a change like this would reduce the numbers of steps in setting up certain activities significantly.\n\nLet me know if a mockup up of a page would be useful (like the activities page) to illustrate this.\n\nd.i.",

Can you give me an example of what that might look like?\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Wednesday, 4 May 2005, 04:17 PM:\n\nAs I don't really understand the requirement and no further information has been forthcoming - I am going to close this. Please feel free to re-open if you have more information. \n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Wednesday, 4 May 2005, 04:36 PM:\n\nSorry Howard<\n\n\n\n I missed your first mail. \n\n\n\nIn Jamie's TUI he just searches for [coursefilesfolder]', '[sitefilesfolder]' and then replaces them with the equivalent $CFG->dataroot./1 or something...er.. the TUI code (downloadable from moodle.org) seems to be very simple (in xml.php):\n\n\n\n                $search_for=  array('[userfullname]', '[userfirstname]', '[userlastname]', '[userpic]', '[coursefilesfolder]', '[sitefilesfolder]', '[siteroot]');\n\n        $replace_with= array(fullname($USER), $USER->firstname, $USER->lastname, $picturelink, $filefolderurl, $sitefilefolderurl, $CFG->wwwroot);\n\n        $filtered_xml=str_ireplace($search_for, $replace_with, $tui->xml) ;\n\n\n\nThe GIFT file would then be for example:\n\n \n\nListen to the following audio<a href=[coursefilesfolder]audio.mp3>:</a> and answer the following question. Why can't I hear anything?{\n\n=%25%Course files are not dealt with by GIFT now.\n\n=%25%Tim has not created a file called audio.mp3\n\n=%25%This can be done using the TUI modle at http://nihonbunka.com/moodle\n\n=%25%It would be great if GIFT could handle this too.\n\n}\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Wednesday, 4 May 2005, 04:53 PM:\n\nSorry - what does 'TUI' mean? I'm unsure what XML code you are referring to.  \n\n\n\nOtherwise, I see what you mean. I guess this would also work for images - could we simply extend the gift format by having a convention for things that are in the files folder, e.g.\n\n\n\n[: images/picture.gif :]\n\n\n\nor whatever. This format is recognises and reconstructed as the appropriate URL in the text. My only worry is then exporting GIFT - it becomes neccessary to 'spot' a URL referring to something in the files area - I suppose it isn't so hard, as it will contain 'file.php' in the text. Thinking :-)\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Wednesday, 4 May 2005, 05:09 PM:\n\nTUI is the name of an exciting new module for moodle (commissioned by me, made by Jamie Pratt) and it can be downloaded from the moodle.org downloads page \n\nhttp://download.moodle.org/download.php/modules/tui.zip\n\n\n\nThe Tui module is a sort of test, with an XML format for defining tests. \n\n\n\nIn the TUI it is particular for images. One could use a convention like you say\n\n[: images/picture.gif :]\n\nbut I would be happy simply with using HTML, as in GIFT till now, and as in the TUI, with a variable, rather than a a sort of new GIFT link format (a la wiki/bb code) but...that would be cool to. I would be hvery happy with the above since it is almost the same as my wiki. How about [[images/file.gif]]? which would assume that there is a folder called images containing a file called file.gif in the course files folder. Personally I don't think it is necessary to be able to specify the site files folder...but I am not sure. \n\n\n\nI had not thought about export but as you say, it becomes neccessary to 'spot' a URL referring to something in the files area yes. I believe that backup and restore does that now. The following code from backup.lib (about line 306). I am not sure it it if relevant. \n\n\n\n    //Calculate the number of course files to backup\n\n    //under $CFG->dataroot/$course, except $CFG->moddata, and backupdata\n\n    //and put them (their path) in backup_ids\n\n    //Return an array of info (name,value)\n\n    function course_files_check_backup($course,$backup_unique_code) {\n\n\n\n        global $CFG;\n\n\n\n        $rootdir = $CFG->dataroot./$course;\n\n        //Check if directory exists\n\n        if (is_dir($rootdir)) {\n\n            //Get files and directories without descend\n\n            $coursedirs = get_directory_list($rootdir,$CFG->moddata,false,true,true);\n\n            $backupdata_dir = backupdata;\n\n            foreach ($coursedirs as $dir) {\n\n                //Check it isn't backupdata_dir\n\n                if (strpos($dir,$backupdata_dir)!==0) {\n\n                    //Insert them into backup_files\n\n                    $status = execute_sql(INSERT INTO {$CFG->prefix}backup_files\n\n                                                  (backup_code, file_type, path)\n\n                                           VALUES\n\n                                              ('$backup_unique_code','course','$dir'),false);\n\n                }\n\n            //Do some output\n\n            backup_flush(30);\n\n            }\n\n        }",

      "24/Aug/07 8:57 AM;712020:6373ec6e-2a10-4a86-9493-052782609013;I am sorry I did not explain the need for this feature. I went into quite a lot of detail on how it could implemented but I did not say what the problem was. Please forgive me for that, and for writing here, first (rather than as a new bug) \n\nThe \"problem\" is:\n\nWhen writing GIFTs referencing media files for use in quizes and lessons what is the standard approach?\n\nFirst of all there is the question as to where to save the files in the first place: on a seperate server, in the moodle site files, or in course files? Each has its advantanges, but the latter, in course files, is perhaps the file upload area of choice for teachers, who may not have their own server, and do not want their multimedia visible to the world.  \n\nOkay, assuming then that the multimendia files are in the course files, the procedure for specifying their url in the GIFT is \n1) Upload the files to the course file area probably in a folder, called \"media\" or something. \n2) Go to that folder.\n3) Right click on one of the files and get its properties.\n4) Copy the link to the file\n5) Use that link in the GIFT\n\nProblems\nThe above procedure is in itself is a bit complex for some teachers. \nThe resultant URL is long and tends to mess up the GIFT layout, be automatically converted to a link by the editing software, and generally looks bad and gets in the way.  \nThe resultant URL may change.\nThe URL contain moodle unfriedly or charset dependent characters (~).  \n*The resultant GIFT is only good for import into the course in question, not generic, for any course that contains the required folder and media files. \nWhen backing up the course and sharing it, it should be the case that Moodle automatically replaces references to the course files so that the backup can be uploaded to another course, or another Moodle installation. In the past (and perhaps this problem has been fixed) the automatic relativisation of the course files folder URL has not always worked. In that case it would be nice to be able to go back to the GIFT, as I have had to do. But then one must first change the absolute(ly)-referenced URL to one appropriate to the new site/course. \n\nThe above are not big problems but, having used the TUI module were I can write something like\n\nListen to the following audio<a href=[coursefiles]/media/audio.mp3>:</a> and answer the following question. \n\nor (if the media is the site file area)\n\nListen to the following audio<a href=[sitefiles]/media/audio.mp3>:</a> and answer the following question. \n\nI know that it makes referencing the files at lot easier, than having to type, as at present\n\nListen to the following audio<a href=http://yufoe.econo.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp/moodle16/file.php/2/]/media/audio.mp3> and answer the following question. \n\nSo, you know it makes sense?! No. But as a mega GIFT writer, I promise it does. \n\nTim"

The issue is that, with multiple answers, there is no longer a single table row in choice_answers so it's unclear what the objectid should be. My understanding of these properties was that they were optional, so it seemed like a reasonable solution to simply remove them as they no longer make sense.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I removed the snapshots is definitely a mistake though!

      "05/Jun/14 7:46 PM;5cf9304823e75a0e7d27e84e;Hi Michael,\r\n\r\nhmm... I am not entirely sure what should be done here. I guess some members of the backend team would have more valuable information, I will ping them.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with changing the definition of an event, is not only causing troubles for existing observers who specifically need to be updated (as you said, no backwards compatibility, but also overhead for plugin developers), but more importantly, as the data of the events is used for logging inconsistencies would be generated. Let's say you are a logger, but you discard the information _objecttable_ (and you should because it is hardcoded within the event), at some point the _objectid_ changes because _objecttable_ has changed in core. Now, all the logging information you have suffers inconsistencies and you do not have any way to recover from it.\r\n\r\nI think an event definition should never change, but I agree that in this situation it is a bit tricky. Another option is to trigger the same event for each answer provided, that might not be ideal, but that provides flat data and follows the logic that was in place previously.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFred",
      "06/Jun/14 12:16 AM;557058:1e36daed-8050-4c4d-b8ec-6a107a244eba;Hi Fred\r\n\r\nTriggering an event per answer is an interesting idea, and I guess it would work for new answers, but I'm not sure how it would work for updates. For example if a user has previously chosen options A and C, then decides to change it only to A, what events would be thrown? Would it be an answer_updated event for A and some new answer_deleted event for C?\r\n\r\nThe only other way I can think of to keep the event handling consistent with the existing functionality would be to do some horrible de-normalised database structure where we would store all a user's answers in a single row, but I'd be reluctant to do that just to maintain backwards compatibility for events. I suspect it would also result in a more complex patch, as with the multiple row structure a lot of the existing functionality continues to work without any need for patching, but I don't think this would be the case if we used a de-normalised structure.\r\n\r\nHopefully the backend team will be able to come up with some ideas!\r\n\r\nCheers, Michael",

However this issue has been waiting for more thought that has not come so I am going to move it forward to force it into view.\r\nAny event changes that are decided upon will surely take less time to implement the process of deciding will take.\r\nHopefully this will still make it in time for 2.8\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nSam",

In mod/quiz/attempt.php, better to use set_field than update_record.\n\n2. In startattempt.php, I think a page= in the URL should override the one stored in the DB, so change the default for optional_param to -1, and then only do your new line of code if $page is -1 (which will be the most common case).\n\n3.

The lowest level, moodle internall stuff, should be up to date. I will attach the mime.types file from my system, but it should not be taken as authorative.  \n\n\n\nhere is a link to the mimetypes that OOo suggests: http://framework.openoffice.org/documentation/mimetypes/mimetypes.html, as those were what got me started on this...\n\nFrom Jelle Boomstra (jelle.bugzilla.moodle at nietsch.dds.nl) Wednesday, 4 May 2005, 07:11 PM:\n\nI did not answer this one:\n\nIf you can tell me a way to make this work on every system that Moodle runs on (including restricted web hosts where users can't read config files directly; non-Apache systems; and Windows) then I'll be happy to fix it.\n\n\n\nAs far as I know moodle does not run on every restricted webhost or platform, so demanding a fix that works on every platform is unrealistic. \n\n\n\nBesides, it is broken now: Moodle does not know the Openoffice mimetypes, and I am sure there are others to be found.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday, 4 May 2005, 11:20 PM:\n\n> As far as I know moodle does not run on every restricted webhost or platform\n\n\n\nWell, it does.  And even if they could read the apache file it wouldn't help much, as it doesn't support any of the new OpenOffice types either.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, we map icons to mime types, so we have to have some sort of internal list anyway.\n\n\n\nI've added all OO 1.0 and 2.0 types into Moodle 1.5 - that was overdue, so thanks for the reminder.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday, 4 May 2005, 11:25 PM:\n\nI'll add for future reference that I only added one icon (odt.gif) for the lot (due to lack of time), if someone comes up with 16x16 .gif icons for the rest of the types I'll happily add them too.\n\nFrom Jelle Boomstra (jelle.bugzilla.moodle at nietsch.dds.nl) Thursday, 5 May 2005, 02:03 AM:\n\n> On top of that, we map icons to mime types, so we have to have some sort of internal list anyway. \n\n\n\nYou don't. There is only one string per mimetype, you can use that as a filename (or convert slashes and spaces first). Instant 1 to 1 mapping, no lists needed. \n\n\n\n> I've added all OO 1.0 and 2.0 types into Moodle 1.5 - that was overdue, so thanks for the reminder.\n\n\n\nwell thanx for adding it. \n\n\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday, 6 May 2005, 04:32 PM:\n\n> Instant 1 to 1 mapping, no lists needed. \n\n\n\nI'm not interested in maintaining many hundreds of icons that mostly look the same, thanks.",

    "Description": "I love the advanced forum search, but... perhaps the block needs a little updating.  As of now, a user does not know they can do an advanced search without doing a regular search first to get the advanced search link unless they click on the help button (who does that).  I was thinking of a re-design like maybe the common little Go button to the right of the search box to do a regular search, and then maybe an Advanced Search link underneath (which would actually be the same as it is now--bring up the advanced search page).  Any thoughts?",

    "Description": "The issue has come up every now and then about wanting to hide the view of blocks from users while allowing admins or teachers to see it.  This could be a useful feature: e.g. I have my admin block hidden from users because I use it all of the time, but I find it a waste of course real estate for the limited function it allows users... I could see this being used with the recent activity block also, or maybe having an announcement block for teachers only....\n\n\n\nNotes to Jon from our discussion: Make this block visible to: all, teachers only, admins only....\n\nAnd giving this configuration option to blocks is a good idea. And with instance configuration it can be made as granular as you want, for example in one course you might have online users visible by everyone and another visible only by the teachers.",

Html area has very specific logic for each browser it encounters and will most likely require updating for Safari. Safari 3 will ship in October... Have you talked to the moodle folks about their testing of the next version? Safari 3 has been available as a beta for testing by developers for the last 6 months so I assume they have given it a spin if they care to support Safari.\"\n\nHere's a link to Safari 3 public beta (now on Windows too, who knew?!) http://www.apple.com/safari/download/\n\nMoodle developers seem to be working on implementation of TinyMCE, but it is not yet working in the current version of Moodle with Safari as far as I can tell.",

Opera suffers the same fate due to this. However, spoofing the browser user agent string in Opera on a moodle installation that has tinymce seems to work, so I know it's not that TinyMCE is not supported, but rather Moodle that is checking for browser in some other code and preventing print_textarea() from doing just that.",
      "13/Oct/07 3:29 AM;712020:14231b93-fb55-4c20-9bb6-17060ffaa8ae;I'm not clear from the above whether the problem is that Safari cannot run the HTML editor, or just that Moodle won't let it try. In an attempt to find out, I modified the function can_use_html_editor() in /lib/moodlelib.php, as follows:\n\n function can_use_html_editor() {\n    global $USER, $CFG;\n\n    if (!empty($USER->htmleditor) and !empty($CFG->htmleditor)) {\n        if (check_browser_version('MSIE', 5.5)) {\n            return 'MSIE';\n        } else if (check_browser_version('Gecko', 20030516)) {\n            return 'Gecko';\n        } else if (check_browser_version('Safari', 522)) {\n            return 'Safari';\n\t\t}\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\nNow when I try (using Safari 3 on Windows), this warning pops up:\n\n\"Mozilla < 1.3 Beta is not supported! I'll try, though, but it might not work.\"\n\nAnd indeed it doesn't work. I just get the empty text-entry box as usual. The warning is generated by /lib/editor/htmlarea/htmlarea.php in a condition that applies only to Gecko browsers. So it seems to be more complicated  than I first thought.",
      "14/Nov/07 3:01 PM;712020:08ce5c32-3df2-47cc-8e3a-e1bbff771703;Not complicated at all...You just need to have correct version of TinyMCE ( =  2.1.2 ) , the version that comes with moodle does not work with Safari or Opera. Then you need to edit function can_use_html_editor in moodlelib.php and change that safari check from htmlarea.php + change functions print_textarea and use_html_editor to be able to use tinymce + have correct init settings for tinymce.\nI have tested TinyMCE in moodle 1.6-1.9 using these changes and it works well with Safari in all modules. I have tested both weblib integration and theme integration but have not used editorlib at all. \n\nTo make it simple use_html_editor does not have to contain anything (I have left this global $THEME; anyway) but you must have it somewhere and print_textarea is the function that replaces correct textareas (class form_textarea) with editor (TinyMCE). For example:\n\nfunction use_html_editor($name='', $editorhidebuttons='', $id='') {\n    global $THEME;\n}\nfunction print_textarea($usehtmleditor, $rows, $cols, $width, $height, $name, $value='', $courseid=0, $return=false, $id='') {\n    global $CFG, $COURSE, $HTTPSPAGEREQUIRED;\n    $str = '';\n    if ($id === '') {\n        $id = 'edit-'.$name;\n    }\nif (empty($courseid)) {\n            $courseid = $COURSE->id;\n        }\nif ($usehtmleditor) {\n    $str .= '<textarea class=\"form-textarea\" id=\"'. $id .'\" name=\"'. $name .'\" rows=\"'. $rows .'\" cols=\"'. $cols .'\">';\n    $str .= htmlspecialchars($value); \n    $str .= '</textarea>'.\"\\n\";\n    $str .= '';\n       }\nelse\n{\n    $str .= '<textarea class=\"alltext\" id=\"'. $id .'\" name=\"'. $name .'\" rows=\"'. $rows .'\" cols=\"'. $cols .'\">';  \n    $str .= s($value);\n    $str .= '</textarea>'.\"\\n\";\n}\n    if ($return) {\n        return $str;\n    }\n    echo $str;\n}\n\nIt is a matter of taste if these functions are in weblib.php or theme files or some other place but TinyMCE needs also init code and usually it is in theme and if settings must be editable (as they will be in moodle...) init code should come from database or some file. I have written init code to theme header.html or meta.php (if I want to use standard theme or some parent theme to give same settings for several themes) to add for example following scripts just before </head> tag:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot ?>/lib/editor/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/tiny_mce_gzip.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\ntinyMCE_GZ.init({\n\tplugins : 'style,layer,table,save,advhr,advimage,advlink,emotions,iespell,insertdatetime,preview,media,'+ \n        'searchreplace,print,contextmenu,paste,directionality,fullscreen,noneditable,visualchars,nonbreaking,xhtmlxtras',\n\tthemes : 'simple,advanced',\n\tlanguages : 'en',\n\tdisk_cache : true,\n\tdebug : false\n});\n</script>\n<!-- Needs to be seperate script tags! -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\ntinyMCE.init({\n\ntheme : \"advanced\",\n\nmode : \"textareas\",\n\nplugins : \"inlinepopups\",\n\nplugins : \"table,save,advhr,advimage,advlink,emotions,iespell,preview,zoom,flash,searchreplace,print,paste,directionality,fullscreen,noneditable,contextmenu\",\ntheme_advanced_buttons1_add : \"preview,zoom,separator,forecolor,backcolor\",\ntheme_advanced_buttons3_add : \"cut,copy,paste,pasteword,separator,emotions,iespell,flash,separator,fullscreen\",\ntheme_advanced_toolbar_location : \"top\",\ntheme_advanced_toolbar_align : \"left\",\n\ntheme_advanced_statusbar_location : \"bottom\",\n\ncontent_css : \"example_full.css\",\n\nplugin_insertdate_dateFormat : \"%Y-%m-%d\",\n\nplugin_insertdate_timeFormat : \"%H:%M:%S\",\n\nextended_valid_elements : 'a[name|href|target|title|onclick],img[class|src|border=\"0\"|alt|title|hspace|vspace|width|height|align|onmouseover|onmouseout|name],hr[class|width|size|noshade],font[face|size|color|style],span[class|align|style]',\n\nexternal_link_list_url : \"link.php\",\n\nexternal_image_list_url : \"inset_image.php\",\n\nflash_external_list_url : \"example_flash_list.js\",\n\npaste_use_dialog : false,\n\ntheme_advanced_resizing : true,\n\ntheme_advanced_resize_horizontal : true,\n\ntheme_advanced_styles : \"Header 1=header1;Header 2=header2;Header 3=header3;Table Row=tableRow1\",\n\napply_source_formatting : true,\n\nconvert_urls : false,\n\nentity_encoding : \"raw\",\n\neditor_selector : \"form-textarea\"\n\n});\n\n// -->\n</script>\n\nFirst two scripts are for compressor to make tinymce faster (must be uploaded separately) and correct textareas are selected with editor_selector: \"form-textarea\".\n\nAnd indeed it works with all current versions of moodle - in Safari, Opera, Firefox and IE. We just need to wait that developers of moodle have enough time to write the official integration code with forms for settings, plugins for files, smilies, language files etc. It sounds a hard work but most of those things are ready already...and waiting for somebody to put it all together ",

Backup restore doesnt quite suit my needs as I only need to share these modules, not the entire course. strange things happen and get pulled across when a colleague at another school tries to restores parts of my backup into an existing course. It would be nice if there was an option to just backup or export one week/unit of work. The feature would include a restore to a new unit and allow the sharing and testing of a smaller parts of my course wihtout any unnecessary baggage of a full restore.",

The problem is time. It's far from be a trivial task (in some modules) and it need a lot of rework to be done in backup code.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I close this as duplicate of MDL-934 (really an old one, you see ;-) )\n\n\n\nSome day.....it will be implemented, sure!",

    "Description": "Hi Martin,\n\n\n\nI posted the code to add a paypal icon for the category page and the front page listings of courses in another bug a while back, so let me know if you want this code again.  Actually, I'm getting very tired of all the little icons, and I think I'll get rid of all of them on those pages except for the info icon.  Partly because I'm stymied as to what to put there if a course has both a cost and a key.  But also because in 1.5 I'm going for a more streamlined look and have even deleted all the icons from the blocks too.  \n\n\n\nAnyway, at the least, please add this code at about line 45 or so to course info.php.  It brings up the PayPal icon, the requirespayment string, the currency and the course cost and looks very nice.\n\n\n\nif ($course->cost) {\n\n        $strrequirespayment = get_string(requirespayment);\n\n         echo <p><font size=\\1\\><img align=\\middle\\ alt=\\\\ height=\\23\\ width=\\37\\ border=\\0\\ src=\\$CFG->pixpath/i/paypal.gif\\ /></a>?$strrequirespayment: $CFG->enrol_currency $CFG->enrol_cost</font></p>; \n\n\n\nI've attached the gif again here. Oh, and by the way, somewhere along the way you duplicated the requirespayment string, so you also have a paymentrequired string.  Not sure if you meant to do that, but just thought I would mention it if you ever spend an exciting day cleaning up code.",

      "03/Nov/11 4:23 AM;5ac1849f01b7457325cf62af;The problem has gone for most languages except zh-cn and zh-tw.\n\nIn Chinese culture, there is not a white space between first name and last name. For example, my name is 孙志岗, not 孙 志岗. Japanese and Korean are also in the same culture. But they add a space in moodle lang file for some reasons.\n\nLong time ago, moodle began to use the following code to determine which name is first:\n\n{code}\n$nameordercheck = new stdClass();\n$nameordercheck->firstname = 'a';\n$nameordercheck->lastname  = 'b';\nif (fullname($nameordercheck) == 'b a' ) {  // See MDL-4325\n    $mform->addElement('text', 'lastname',  get_string('lastname'),  'maxlength=\"100\" size=\"30\"');\n    $mform->addElement('text', 'firstname', get_string('firstname'), 'maxlength=\"100\" size=\"30\"');\n} else {\n    $mform->addElement('text', 'firstname', get_string('firstname'), 'maxlength=\"100\" size=\"30\"');\n    $mform->addElement('text', 'lastname',  get_string('lastname'),  'maxlength=\"100\" size=\"30\"');\n}\n{code}\n\nIt assume that all lang have a space between first name and last name. So, it does not work for zh-cn and zh-tw.\n\nI suggest that add a lib function, firstname_first(), to determine the order. The function should consider the white space case. Function like this is required in many places, such as MDL-26171, user/editlib.php",

Threading works really great for me in Thunderbird or Gmail.\n\n\n\nI've just modified them in 1.5 to look like this:\n\n\n\nList-Id: Tips and Tricks <moodleforum114@moodle.org>\n\nList-Help: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?f=114\n\nMessage-Id: <moodlepost110904@moodle.org>\n\nIn-Reply-To: <moodlepost110900@moodle.org>\n\nReferences: <moodlepost110900@moodle.org>\n\nX-Course-Id: 5\n\nX-Course-Name: Using Moodle\n\n\n\n- will that do for your filtering?\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Tuesday,  10 May 2005, 04:44 PM:\n\nHmm, I fail to see the concern of nbhansen at midway. Right now, the prefix in subject for all forums in Using Moodle is Using Moodle:. The forum prefix that I suggested would replace Using Moodle: with mine text, which most likely will be shorter not longer. Forum names (particularly in German which is what my site uses) are rather long. \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  10 May 2005, 04:59 PM:\n\nWhat I changed in the code addresses your original point 2 and 3 exactly ... Point 1 is not addressed direcly by changing the subject line but if you set up filters you can make them different colors or put them in different folders.   You can test this out on the moodle.org mail if you like as it's implemented there.   \n\n\n\nYou also said:\n\n> they can't easily distinguish which emal comes from which course\n\n\n\nThat's exactly why the course short name is used as the subject prefix.   ;-)\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Tuesday,  10 May 2005, 05:17 PM:\n\nMartin, you may be looking at this from wrong angle. \n\n\n\nThe problem with list headers is that they are not consistently used/implemented and they do not help to visually see which forum the message belongs unless I really filter the posts (all headers are hidden in mail client). Setting up filters for each forum based on headers is kinda pain in the neck. Look at Using Moodle course with its multitude of forums. I post and subscribe (and get dropped after a while) to different forums, depending what issues I am facing. I am fairly active now being new to Moodle but this will fizzle away once all works. The volume of mail from each forum is not big enough to go through the trouble of setting a new mailbox and filters (and remember to delete them when dropped from forum not to slow down filtering). I rather have all Moodle posts go into a single mailbox and then use Eudora's concatenator (not same as threading and I find it more useful -- on many lists I am on, people start new thread by replying to older post, granted not the issue for Moodle since it does not accept email posts, but Moodle is only one of many things I do and I am too busy to develop new habits just for Moodle while retaining other modes of operation otherwise; I doubt I am unique in that respect). \n\n\n\nWhat I am suggesting that the GUI for setting up a forum allows me to enter an email prefix as an optional item. This is stored in db in the record defining the forum. When mail is being sent, the script checks whether custom prefix is set. When yes, this prefix is used. When not, the prefix is set as it is now. I believe this should not be a difficult modification or have any side effects.\n\n\n\nCurrently, it seems that the course name not forum name is used as prefix. I gather this is because different courses are likely to have forums of the same name (like the default news forum created for each course). This is logical except its deficiency when a course has multiple forums. The solution could be to use both course name and forum name, but then the prefix can be unwieldy long. Allowing custom prefix solves all IMHO by giving control to site administrators and teachers. It would surely allow me to handle them gracefully at my site: I will have 120-150 courses per semester with students typically taking 4-6 in parallel. We set up all courses with minimum of 2 forums, each with the same name for all courses, one being teacher announcements and another open forum for participants (so it makes a difference to students which post comes from which forum and which course). Some teachers set up additional forums for specific projects.\n\n\n\nI do not see how any generic (fixed) approach can be universally useful in this case. Your current approach worked fine for Moodle being used by individual teachers or tight operations but now that it is spreading into enterprise-level use, you need to allow more control.\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Tuesday,  10 May 2005, 05:35 PM:\n\nA short post scriptum: \n\n\n\nThe extra headers you added can be useful for people who want to use them,. The indeed address explicitly some points I originally made. However, I am looking for a more general solution that works for different people with different mail software and usage habits. In particular, I should have added that very few people here, both teachers and students, use mail filtering. As shocking as it may be nowadays, it is a fact -- I observed this myself.\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Thursday,  12 May 2005, 05:25 PM:\n\nI have modified my moodle to use not just the course short name but also forum name as email prefix. It actually comes out okay, although it is a tad long. I am also going to try out what I suggested with extra field in db. An alternative would be to have an extra field for each forum with short forum name (parallel to short title for course) and prefix posts with course short name and forum short name. Hmm, I can see situations when one or the other would be preferable. For example, forums on the homepage would be better of with custom email prefix but forums in most courses would be better of with coursename/forumname format.\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Saturday,  28 May 2005, 09:41 AM:\n\nIt occured to me that this should be an email preference controlled by each user (and set globally for all forums, just as we set type of email now). \n\n\n\nIf I am happy with the thread headers, I may keep shorter subject. Otherwise, I may ask to have [course:forum] as subject prefix or the custom prefix (set up in forum definition). Additionally, we should be able to choose whether the prefix is in brackets or not.\n\n\n\nI came to this after realizing that different users have different preferences and use different email software which handles list mail differently.",

The code I provided controls the access; however, one more patch is needed to allow posts and I don't have time now to investigate it, particularly since I am using 1.4.4 and Moodle is quickly progressing to 1.5 and 1.6.\n\n\n\nAlso, there should be an option whether to actually create an instructor-only forum for individual courses. It seems it is created automatically and the only option is whether the instructor joins it or not. Sites having 100s of courses can possibly save some database space and activity by creating such forum on demand only.\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Friday,  17 February 2006, 01:08 AM:\n\nI am closing this entry as I consider it not worth implementing after using Moodle for a year now.

    "Description": "A few of our users asked about sorting files in the directory resource. It seems that at present the only way to control the order of files in a directory resource is by numbering them or naming them alphabetically. \n\n\n\nIdeally, teachers should be able to specify the order of files, like we admins do it for ordering teachers. However, this would be an overkill at this stage.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a welcome improvement would be to allow sorting of Directory files by clicking on the colum name (Name, size, Modify). That is, order alphabetically, by size or by last mod, ascending or descending. This would be consistent with the interface of the Participants list.\n\n\n\nA course-wide setting should allow to define the default sorting, so each teacher can preset it to match ther style of organizing resources.\n\n\n\nIt would be acceptable that initially only teachers can sort, like we admins do it with courses.",

It's weird enough to be a variable I think. I'm leaning that way :-)\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday,  12 May 2005, 11:49 PM:\n\nThis will go away with the Customisable MyMoodle in 1.6 anyway ...\n\n\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Friday,  13 May 2005, 12:00 AM:\n\nOk - but would you have any problem with my just sticking this in as a variable 'for now'? I might be old(er) and grey(er) by the time 1.6 appears :-) This change would help us out quite a lot with a couple of 'information only' style sites.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  13 May 2005, 12:51 AM:\n\nNot in the main distribution please ... for now options are not good ... \n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  13 May 2005, 12:57 AM:\n\nAt least not in the GUI  ;-)\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Friday,  13 May 2005, 01:30 PM:\n\nI'm not sure you see what I mean here - but (to be honest) I don't know what the 'MyMoodle' thing is going to do :-) \n\n\n\nHowever, I am guessing it allows users/students to set their own 'look and feel'. If so, that's not what I am proposing. This is intended to *always* be an administration option to (I suppose) 'lock down' the front page so it doesn't change when somebody logs on. This is for high-profile Moodle installs where it desirable for the view to be fixed. Example - we have a 'main university moodle' which does not have 'conventional' courses. The courses are Moodle documentation and support stuff and the My Courses page is counter-intuitive for students in this context - I have a feeling that 'MyMoodle' would be too - so maybe I am actually proposing a *FixedFrontPage* option.\n\n\n\nBut.... If that doesn't wash I would like to just put the My Courses thing in as a 'hidden' config setting for now.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Friday,  13 May 2005, 02:18 PM:\n\nI do see what you mean, but the GUI will have to change to accommodate MyMoodle later on.\n\n\n\nI've just added logic in /index.php to check for the presence of $CFG->disablemycourses = true;\n\n\n\nso if you put that in config.php it'll work.  Can you put it in config-dist.php please?\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Friday,  13 May 2005, 02:24 PM:\n\nYou are truly a star :-D Thanks!\n\n\n\nI'll sort config-dist.php!",

Maybe the teacher does not want the answer field to correspond the the length of the correct answer.\n\nFrom   (miksik at mrakoplas.phil.muni.cz) Tuesday,  17 May 2005, 01:27 PM:\n\nSetting field lengths individually for hundreds of questions could be quite tedious; and it seems unncecesarry to me: if the teacher should have a choice, maybe this could rather be an option on the cloze setup page: adaptive/fixed-length fields.\n\nI think we can count on teachers wanting to have the field long enough so that students can see their whole answer filled in. Maybe I could post this into Using Moodle to discuss it with others?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Tuesday,  17 May 2005, 01:52 PM:\n\nHow about giving the teacher the option to either choose a length OR have it determined from the answer. I am thinking of situations where the answer is very short but the teacher does not want to give this information away.\n\n\n\nIn any case the length of the answer field should be determined at authoring time. I.e., your code for calculating the length of the answer field should be moved into save_question(). Recalculating it each time the question is presented to a student is too inefficient.\n\n\n\nThis option should not be specific to cloze questions but apply to shortanswer, numerical, calculated, ..\n\nFrom   (miksik at mrakoplas.phil.muni.cz) Tuesday,  17 May 2005, 02:47 PM:\n\nI would be happy with this being specific to cloze qs as with all other question types what would usually do would be fixed length: if it's long enough, it solves both the visibility of the whole answer filled in AND the information about the length of the answer not being given away.\n\n\n\nThe case is different with cloze qs where you need to embed the form fields into the flow of the text - it's here where too long fixed fields could degrade readability and too short fixed fields could impair students' control of their own answering.\n\n\n\nWhat I have in mind is trying to keep things simple where it is possible, i.e. not adding new options if the current solution suits the needs of most users.\n\n\n\n> In any case the length of the answer field should be determined at authoring time. [...]\n\nYes, if there is a db field for it, it would be much more efficient.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Tuesday,  17 May 2005, 02:55 PM:\n\nWe could add such fields to the database. It should not be a field to the quiz_multianswers table but to both the quiz_numerical and the quiz_shortanswer tables. I agree with you that having variable length fields is much less important for these question types by themselves, but because a cloze question can contain several numerical or shortanswer questions as subquestions it would be easier to store the length information for each of these in the table of the corresponding question type rather than in the quiz_multinaswers table.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom   (miksik at mrakoplas.phil.muni.cz) Tuesday,  17 May 2005, 03:56 PM:\n\nOK, so the information about field length would be stored with all shortanswer and numerical questions conditionally?\n\na) If they are used by themselves the db field would be prefilled with a fixed value.\n\nb) If they are used in a cloze question, the length would be calculated from the answer - provided the teacher opts for this during the cloze question setup.\n\nDo I understand you right, Gustav?\n\n\n\n(I'm not a programmer so I don't feel competent to comment on this really but) to me, storing the length information in the quiz_multianswers table would seem convenient if this information would not be used and needed elsewhere. An example:\n\nid  question  sequence        length\n\n1   14        15,16,17,18,19  36,12,0,0,60\n\nThe zero values being filled in automatically for other then numerical/shortanswer questions.\n\n\n\nBTW, looking at the Moodle 1.5 quiz_questions database table I can see there is a field named 'length' but I'm uncertain about its purpose.",
      "20/Jan/08 6:54 AM;557058:da9db912-345f-4bcd-930f-662df4367d7c;I think this is really important (and simple) issue, as in secure mode students even can't see their answer if it's bigger than field.\n\nI suppose, first (and very big)  step to resolve this problem can be just option for the teacher to select field length according to the right answer.

    "Description": "During the rush to get the new quiz module ready for Moodle 1.5 Eloy, Julian and I had valuable discussions about how to reform the handling of random questions. In the end we decided that for Moodle 1.5 we would have to go back to a model that uses the same response storage as Moodle 1.4 because otherwise the upgrade and restore scripts would become too complicated to write and test in the available time. However we do want to make changes for Moodle 1.6.\n\n\n\nI am posting an email exchange with Eloy on this here so that it gets preserved until we get time to deal with it again.\n\n\n\nHere is my proposal for how to deal with random questions.\n\n\n\nA random question will not be a question type. It will simply be a\n\nrandomly chosen question. So an attempt will only consists of ordinary\n\nquestions. Some of them, it is true, are randomly chosen when the\n\nattempt is started, but there is no reason why the attempt has to\n\nworry about that any more. Similarly responses are always responses to\n\nordinary questions, so no random question type will show up in the\n\nstates table.\n\n\n\nOnly the quiz has to know that some of its questions are to be\n\nrandomly chosen. So we need to decide on some mechanism to store that\n\ninformation. I propose something very simple: The field\n\n$quiz->questions will, as currently, be a comma separated list of\n\nthings. These things can be:\n\n1) a number corresponding to the id of a question,\n\n2) a zero indicating a page break,\n\n3) the letter c followed by a number indicating the id of a category\n\nfrom which a question is to be randomly chosen\n\n4) the letter r followed by a number indicating the id of a category.\n\nA random question is to be randomly chosen from this category and all\n\nits subcategories.\n\n\n\nThere are only three places in the code that need to be changed:\n\n1) the editing page. I can do this quite easily (I wrote most of it)\n\nand the code will actually become simpler.\n\n2) the function quiz_create_attempt() when creating $attempt->layout\n\nwill replace the c.. and r.. things by randomly chosen questions.\n\n3) the upgrade code\n\n\n\nWhat we gain by this is that we can get rid of the whole hidden random\n\nquestion type.\n\n\n\nThe old model where the information about which question was chosen\n\nwas stored in the response table seems outright wacky. This is not\n\ninformation about the response but about the attempt and should\n\ntherefore be stored in the quiz_attempts table. My proposal achieves\n\nthat.\n\n\n\nThe upgrade should not be too bad because the responses to the actual\n\nquestions were already stored correctly in the past. We only have to\n\nget rid of the dummy responses that are actually pointing to the\n\nquestions and put this information into $attempt->layout instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is Eloy's reply:\n\n\n\nyour plans sounds pretty well, although I'm not 100% sure if such\n\nchange should be done just now.\n\n\n\nAlthough the change seems really simple, just a change in the encoding\n\nof quiz->questions and inside quiz_create_attempt(), it would involve\n\nupdating tons of quizzes under Moodle's servers, looking for every\n\nrandom question used and their real counterparts for each existing\n\nattempt to be able to personalize each attempt->layout field.\n\n\n\nAnd, talking about pre15 restore code, it will imply to rebuild the\n\nattempt->layout field AFTER their states has been restored (to be able\n\nto extract each real question used) and after it, delete all those\n\nrandom responses from states.\n\n\n\nDoesn't it sound complex? At least for me, yes. Anyway, perhaps I'm a\n\nbit paranoid but, at current development stage, adding such IMPORTANT\n\nchange in a question (and the overall module) sounds really dangerous\n\n(potentially, I know).\n\n\n\nFinally, if the objective is to avoid using the states->answer field\n\nto  store attempt-definition information, we have another question\n\ntype using such field to store attempt info. It's the RANDOMSAMATCH\n\nqtype. It stores what shortanswers questions has used. Being strict,\n\nwe should change the quiz->questions and attempt->layout fields to be\n\nable to encode such info correctly and then, in states, only standard\n\nshortanwer responses should be present.",

For ordinary questions it is stored in the quiz_question_instances table that is indexed by quiz id and question id. We can't simply create one entry for each actually used question in that table because what would we do in a quiz that has two random questions with different maximum grades that draw questions from the same category?\n\n\n\nSo let's shelf this proposal for the time being. I will propose a different solution to the bugs in the current implementation (bug 3357 and MDL-3312).",

    "Description": "It would be nice if Moodle allowed secondary authentication at site and course levels (one or the other for any given site) using an external database or a text file (imported into an extra table in moodle's database). Having secondary authentication can be useful and even required in some enterprise or paid-course settings. All the functionality is already programmed for primary verification, so it would be just a matter of repurposing it, adding the verification code and gui to control.\n\n\n\nFor example, one of my clients, a departmental Moodle serving over 100 courses and some 1500 students, uses pop3 authentication (same would be for ldap) to the central university server. This means that anyone at the university can access this moodle. With some class sizes of 200-300 students, the access password offers only limited protection. At the same time, the course registration data that could be used for secondary authentication. They already have some 10% of user accounts unused/incomplete from users who get to profile page but never complete it (the site requires login to see any content).",

    "Description": "Moodle could go one little step further with support for personalizing, localizing, and/or extending language files. If I create a new language, for example en_local, to replace a few of the standard strings or to add an extra string, then this language shows up as 'English (en_local)' in the language popup menu. Not very professional and potentially confusing to some users. I'd like to use en_local as language but still have 'English (en)' in the menu. Our users do not care whether the texts are localized or not.\n\n\n\n<br><br>Moodle could  designate the _local locale suffix as having a special meaning: designating a language customization. It'd automatically strip this suffix from the language code when building the popup menu (or simply use the parentlanguage string). This would also make such language folders easily identifiable as not part of the distribution.\n\n\n\n<br><br>I believe this would also make it easier to add extra strings for a given site, which is particularly useful for true multilingual sites, offering an alternative to multilang filter for fixed web page elements. I suspect that using a custom language pack is more efficient than multilang filter.",

Namely, that we do not need to actually select en_local as the language but Moodle simply checks whether there is en_local when attempting to use en and if it finds it, then gives it precendence. In other words, the _local files would not be true language packs and would not show in the interface for Moodle at all.\n\n\n\nI think this would make things even simpler for users, particularly those providing true multilingual sites. Those that need to do a more complete rewrite would create a new language pack. Those who need to overwrite or add just a few strings, would create _local file for any language they wish.\n\nFrom oen roggemans (koen at roggemans.net) Monday,  30 May 2005, 04:38 AM:\n\nSince this is coding and no language packs issue I pass this bug to Martin\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Tuesday,  31 May 2005, 07:42 PM:\n\ncase in point\n\n\n\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=24728\n\n\n\nalso the following would probably work better with adding custom strings that using multilan filter\n\n\n\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=24342\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Tuesday,  31 May 2005, 08:10 PM:\n\nI like the _local idea and though it will slow things down marginally it's worth doing.\n\n\n\nHowever the example you pointed to in the last comment is about content, not interface, so string packs are not relevant.\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Thursday,  10 November 2005, 09:43 PM:\n\nI have seen in recent discussions renewed questions about customizing emails sent to students or login page info.

This patch will provide course admins with a unified page which groups together activities by date.  Adjustments can be made individually or by groupings, either by relative date adjustments (days, hours, and minutes) or by absolut date adjustments.  Since most activities which share a common date are most likely to continue to share a common date after rolling over to a new time period, it makes the most sense to sort all activities into similar date groups so they can be updated at one time.\n\n\n\nSome screenshots and discussion can be found at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=9697.",

Also I lost abouth 55000 records :-).",

At the moment, a teacher can add a comment to the review, but there is no guarantee the student will see the comment unless they browse the glossary. There needs to be a way to notify the student of the outcome of the teacher's review.",

I can see the merit in this approach but but could an option to view and mark all the work submitted on a single page be restored?\n\n\n\nWith Verison 1.4, I would increase the reflection by students on the work that they submitted by displaying the submitted work page on a class room projector. This single page would either list all the assignements submitted or journal entries made. We could reflect and build upon on all our responses by just scrolling up and down. This metacognition is a very powerful tool but gets easily lost with the latency of too much clicking and jumping around. A single page is also easy to display or later printout for my records and parent/teacher night.\n\n\n\nThis could be done by either modifying the view of the current page or generating a new page.",

The html editor insert image requires you to insert a alt/title tag, which I don't want or need to do, in addition to specifying the padding each time individually. I'm wondering if this isn't the sort of thing that wouldn't be solved by your MDL-4795? If the html were separated out then I could just set the padding for all images at one time.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Friday,  14 July 2006, 08:43 PM:\n\nI resolved this somehow, I think by adding a return in the question text before where the image would be displayed.

I understand that under the hood they nicely share the same code, but I submit to present them to users as two different resources. \n\n\n\nThey are in fact different. One refers a file that had to be uploaded to local server, so it is functionally similar to 'display directory'. Another refers to a web page somewhere in the world. \n\n\n\nThis split would allow for improved verification of input (cf MDL-3558) and adding control of the icons (bug 3338).\n\n\n\nThe file resource could display file size and last update date in parallel to what display a directory resource does. This is often important to students (since files are often updated in the course of semester) but instructors notoriously forget to add it manually.",

      "23/Jul/05 6:23 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Friday,  24 June 2005, 09:07 PM:\n\nRemoving lines 185 through 195 in lib/gdlib.php removes the black border.\n\n\n\nAll the hard work of adding classes to each image has been done so the following CSS restores it in every place that I've checked (forums, glossary, profile, quiz, chat, choice) which is enough that if it doesn't work somewhere then that place should be fixed by adding the appropriate class.\n\n\n\nimg.userpicture { border: 1px solid #000; }\n\n\n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Friday,  24 June 2005, 09:18 PM:\n\nI'm not using any border, so I could just leave the CSS rule out after changing the PHP code. But I noticed that the image is quite often hyperlinked to the users profile so I've added the following:\n\n\n\nimg.userpicture { border: 1px solid #fff; }\n\na:hover img.userpicture { border: 1px solid #06c; }\n\n\n\nWhere #fff and #06c are my theme's background and link color respectively. This is a usability plus as there is some feedback on rollover that the image is in fact clickable.\n\nFrom Urs Hunkler (u.hunkler at elearningkontor.de) Friday,  24 June 2005, 09:57 PM:\n\nDavid, your bug is realted to mine: MDL-3365.\n\n\n\nGreat, you found the source. Will you commit the changes? To 1.5 or 1.6?\n\n\n\nI would propose you commit it to 1.5 too, change the theme standard and write a note in the forum. Then the theme developers can update their themes. What do you think?\n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Monday,  27 June 2005, 08:38 PM:\n\nI've all required changes to the HEAD branch with one exception (details later).\n\n\n\nlib/gdlib.php no longer adds the border to uploaded images\n\npix/u/f1.png and f2.png no longer have borders pre-added\n\nlib/weblib now outputs a 'userpicture' class for both default and customised user pictures. It also has a 'defaultuserpic' class for separate styling of default picture borders.\n\n\n\nI tried to add the following CSS to the standard theme but it wouldn't let me check them in to CVS. I don't know why. Could you add them?\n\n\n\nimg.userpicture,\n\nimg.grouppicture {\n\n  border: 1px solid #000;\n\n}\n\n\n\nI'll post some info to the Themes forum so that other theme designers know what's happening.\n\n\n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Monday,  27 June 2005, 09:40 PM:\n\nI forgot the user image in the Online Users block.\n\n\n\nIt's done differntly from everywhere else so it probably needs CSS like:\n\n\n\n.block_online_users .listentry img {\n\n   border: thin solid #888;\n\n}\n\n\n\n(Using a lighter shade of gray to simulate a black line of less than 1 pixel width. The exact shade should probably depend on the  background color)\n\nFrom Urs Hunkler (u.hunkler at elearningkontor.de) Tuesday,  28 June 2005, 01:43 AM:\n\nGreat David. I have commited the CSS changes to styles_layout and styles_color. Now I easily can turn the block border off :-)\n\nFrom Urs Hunkler (u.hunkler at elearningkontor.de) Tuesday,  28 June 2005, 02:02 AM:\n\nDavid, if I read your posting in the forum right, you commited the chnages only to 1.6 head branch. The bug is related to version 1.5 (see abouve, I've just changed it ;-) and I think it is an anoying bug. Do you mind commiting the changes also to 1.5 stable? Because of the double black borders I think it is good to have the change in an early 1.5 state.\n\nFrom Urs Hunkler (u.hunkler at elearningkontor.de) Thursday,  30 June 2005, 02:58 PM:\n\nDavid, I have looked at your changes. Is it correct that you changed the lines adding the black border in gdlib.php and added the class in weblib.php. Please tell me if that are all changes. I want to add them to 1.5.\n\n\n\nMartin, I added you to this bug discussion. Please speak up if you have any concerns fixing this bug in Moodle one 1.5.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Wednesday, 6 July 2005, 09:47 PM:\n\nOK, just found this ... firstly, the borders allow images to look nice in other contexts like mobile browsers or Gmail which doesn't use CSS.\n\n\n\nI do agree in principle that it would be nice to customise this (even though it's surely very very low priority in a theme).\n\n\n\nThe problem with the way it's been done here is that there are double borders now.  It's not enough to just change the code for new images, one has to retrospectively redo all the old images too otherwise upgraded sites look really messy (much worse than it used to).   Think of moodle.org with half the images having 1px border, and half the images having 2px border.\n\n\n\nIn any case, such a thing is not for 1.5 where people expect stability.\n\n\n\nI've backed out the recent changes until a smoother upgrade path can be found, or more justification can be found.\n\nFrom Urs Hunkler (u.hunkler at elearningkontor.de) Wednesday, 6 July 2005, 10:58 PM:\n\nOk, Martin. I did not reflect the update of big Moodle sites enough. Sorry, but you cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs ;-)\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about a config option in Moodle 1.6 and the hint to convert existing pictures?\n\n\n\nUrs\n\n\n\nPS. For the record - ... (even though it's surely very very low priority in a theme) In this point I disagree, black borders around images are a pain for the eyes (those eyes that care ;-).\n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Wednesday, 6 July 2005, 11:11 PM:\n\nA totally seamless upgrade path suggestion:\n\n\n\n* newly uploaded images are given a different location and/or name (and no border)\n\n\n\n* when outputing a user image (in the print_user_picture function in weblib) check the new name/location first to see if it exists and output it with appropriate CSS, then the old name , then if neither are found print the default image (again with appropriate CSS classes)\n\n\n\n(I have to admit I'm confused about where the checking to see if an image exists occurs. It appears to be done before this function is called and the result passed in as $picture. This suggests you might sometimes want to display the default image, even after the user has uploaded an image)\n\n\n\nI'm happy to code this so that people can kick the tyres and see what they think.\n\n\n\nPS I could also add a border=1 etc. to the img tag in the HTML if non-css contexts are a serious issue.\n\n\n\nPS 2 This bug database really doesn't like me, it just tried to eat this response, and I'm sure that I replied to Urs's earlier comment about checking what files I had changed but can't see it now. Oh well.\n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Thursday, 7 July 2005, 12:23 AM:\n\nI've committed the code for the transition path I mentioned so you can try it out and see what you think. (I got an error on commit that made me think that someone was reverting my changes on HEAD. Surely we have enough time before 1.6 to sort this out?)\n\n\n\ngood things\n\n----------\n\nit names newly uploaded images differently from the old scheme. This can be used to identify which images have an embedded border.\n\n\n\nit attaches appropriate CSS classes to the different types of images so that you can make them match visually in a transition period.\n\n\n\nbad things\n\n--------\n\nEvery time a user image is displayed it checks to see if a file exists in order to determine if new or old user pictures are there. Ideally this would be done once and the stored value could be switched by the upload code.\n\n\n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Thursday, 7 July 2005, 12:27 AM:\n\nI forgot to mention, the group image code needs similar changes, which I'll do once the changes to the user pix are finalised.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Thursday, 7 July 2005, 01:10 AM:\n\nThis idea still not going to solve the original problem (black borders).  It's also not very elegant and could potentially break third-party hacks that depend on file names and so on.\n\n\n\nHow about we just process all the old images and fix them up?\n\n\n\n  - we could resize them slightly, or\n\n  - we could extrapolate each edge pixel based on its inner neighbour\n\nFrom David Scotson (d.scotson at admin.gla.ac.uk) Friday,  22 July 2005, 10:23 PM:\n\nI've rolled back the previous code I added and followed Martin's suggestion above i.e. there is now code in gdlib.php that will resize the f1.png image a little bit bigger, cropping the border or (if the resize function is not available through GD) it will color the border based on it's inner neighbour pixels.\n\n\n\nI tested on a variety of userpictures from Moodle.org and the results are fairly equal between the two methods (the resize loses an extra 2 pixels from the image and introduces a slight fuzz, the interpolation picks up some slight muddiness around the edges on solid-colour, pale backgrounds because of JPG artifacts in the orignals) so it might be best to choose between them based entirely on speed. The resize is doing much more work, but it's doing it through GD so it's anyone's guess as to which is faster without doing some experiments.\n\n\n\nThere's a testpage at userpix/upgrade.php that lets an admin run the upgrade function on all current userpixs to see the effect and roughly how long it takes (this is a permanent change so only try it on backups or test machines). If it's fast enough then this should probably be part of the 1.5->1.6 upgrade. If not it could be done at the admin's discretion.\n\n\n\nBear in mind that the resize code will zoom further and further in if you run it repeatedly (the interpolation code won't).",

If I want to put a description at the top of every page, even if the description is the same for more than one page, I have to create a separate description for each one and insert it. It would be better if there was a question category called instructions that would be related to groups of questions. This instruction would appear at the top of every page that contained members of a group of questions, or mid-page if a new group of questions started.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Saturday,  25 June 2005, 10:34 PM:\n\nYet another difficulty encountered with the description is that it counts as a question for purposes of determining where the page breaks go, which is terribly confusing.",

    "Description": "I have an idea how the insertion of page breaks could be improved in the quiz, as I find the automated system more trouble than a manual system would be because I don't want to always put them after a fixed number of questions. You could have 2 page break options-1 like the current system where you can specify the number of questions per page for teachers who want a standardized system, and 2-where you can manually insert a page break wherever you like. The 2nd option could be implemented by adding an icon next to each question that would allow the teacher to insert a page break after that question.",
    "Comments": "26/Jun/06 6:47 PM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday,  26 June 2005, 07:36 PM:\n\nThis already exists. You have to click on the Show page breaks checkbox in order to manipulate page breaks manually. Perhaps the language strings need to be changed?\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Monday,  27 June 2005, 05:16 AM:\n\nI realize you can do that. I have it turned on. But the problem is that they are inserted at pre-set intervals and then you have to move them around, one by one, and then if you move one up, all the others sometimes shift to maintain the pre-set interval. Your only choice is to either delete, or create a new one at the bottom and move it up one spot by one spot. If I want a page break after 33 questions, and another after 18, and another after 20, and another after 22-it's a lot of work to get them in those positions. It would be a lot easier if I could just say insert one here, insert one here, insert one here and insert one here. It would take 4 clicks whereas as it is now it might take dozens of clicks to achieve the same affect.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday, 7 July 2005, 11:07 PM:\n\nThis goes in the same direction as another feature request about an easier way for re-ordering questions in a quiz. I changed the title to make it a bit clearer and classified it as a feature request. I am afraid I probably won't be motivated do anything about it until I start some heavy quiz creation and run into the problem myself.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  13 February 2006, 06:11 AM:\n\nI just found the feature request for easier movement of questions. It is MDL-2240. Both movement of questions and movement of page breaks would probably be addressed at the same time.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  20 February 2006, 01:01 AM:\n\nThe new reordering tool also helps with getting the page breaks to where you want them.\n\n\n\nThe main thing that has stopped me from doing anything about this bug is that I can't think of a good user interface. If you can suggest an unobstrusive and intuitive user interface for inserting page breaks straight away to where you want them, then describe your ideas here.\n\n\n\nI am lowering the priority of this feature request now.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  20 February 2006, 01:02 AM:\n\nSorry, hit the wrong buttons when saving the previous comment.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Monday,  20 February 2006, 07:26 AM:\n\nWhat I can think of off the top of my head would be to do it in a way similar to the way one can add new chapters in the book module. By clicking on the red cross, you are able to insert a new chapter after the line for the chapter on which the red cross is. Perhaps having an icon of some sort next to the up down arrows that would allow you to insert a page break would do the trick.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Monday,  26 June 2006, 10:47 AM:\n\nNew reordering tool solves this problem.",

I am therefore reopening.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday,  25 August 2005, 10:55 PM:\n\nAnd another report at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=29517\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Wednesday, 7 September 2005, 03:15 AM:\n\nI just recalled that this problem was caused by an incorrect $CFG->wwwroot setting in config.php.\n\n\n\nEveryone affected, can you please triple check that your $CFG->wwwroot appears EXACTLY AS IT IS DEFINED as a prefix in your Moodle installation's URLs? In other words, is your Moodle index page's URL EXACTLY THE SAME as your $CFG->wwwroot (except from a slash at the end)?\n\n\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Thursday, 8 September 2005, 11:41 PM:\n\nAfter having an email conversation with Chris Davis who also had this problem, we can conclude that:\n\n\n\n1. The error is caused by an incorrect $CFG->wwwroot setting.\n\n\n\n2. $CFG->wwwroot should be a fully qualified URL (prefix) and not a partial (relative) URL.\n\n\n\nThis is GOOD: http://some.hosting.net/moodlesite\n\n\n\nThis is BAD:  /moodlesite\n\n\n\n3. If for some reason you need your wwwroot to have one of several possible values depending on some factor (e.g. if the person accessing Moodle is inside or outside a particular firewall), the correct solution is this:\n\n\n\nInstead of using a partially qualified URL, put some elementary logic (if/else statements) in your config.php file to select one wwwroot value depending on some parameter (e.g. $SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] or $SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) and make sure that all of these possible values are fully qualified URLs.\n\n\n\nChris solved this problem for his installation by changing\n\n\n\n$CFG->wwwroot = /class;\n\n\n\nto\n\n\n\n$CFG->wwwroot = http://.$_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]./class;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBug closed.\n\nFrom Chardelle Busch (chardelle at lifeworkouts.com) Sunday,  16 October 2005, 10:47 AM:\n\nHi Jon,\n\n\n\nI'm also getting this error when I click on the import a quiz link, see discussion: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=32699, it is for the quiz locallib page though.  There's something goofy going on here.\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Thursday,  20 October 2005, 10:10 PM:\n\nFor reference:\n\n\n\nAs answered in that forum discussion, this isn't the same issue. The original appears in pagelib.php line 87, while Chardelle's appears in locallib.php line 2688. :)\n\nFrom Keola Donaghy (keola at nahenahe.net) Saturday,  25 February 2006, 03:15 PM:\n\nAloha. I'm getting this error: \n\n\n\n\n\nFatal error: Cannot instantiate non-existent class: in /Library/WebServer/Documents/moodle/lib/pagelib.php on line 67\n\n\n\nWnenever I click on any link that uses the view.php. I have checked \n\n$CFG->wwwroot, and this is the value:\n\n\n\n'http://132.160.51.101/moodle'\n\n\n\nWhich seems to be OK based on the notes below. I am on OS X Server 10.4.5. I can create an account on this system for anyone that would like to try. I'm a Moodle newbie, so appreciate you patience if I'm missing something obvious. Mahalo (thanks).\n\nFrom Keola Donaghy (keola at nahenahe.net) Monday,  27 February 2006, 11:39 AM:\n\nAs a follow-up to my previous, I found that there were DNS issues with the IP I was using. I set a new one which is a FQDN, and I still get the same error.\n\n\n\nhttp://sub51-110.uhh.hawaii.edu/moodle/\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Keola Donaghy (keola at nahenahe.net) Tuesday,  28 February 2006, 07:33 AM:\n\nFixed. I found a discussion regarding this, and upon turning debugging on, I could see that OS X server was adding :16080 to the URL, even though it was not visible in the browser window. Adding that to the config file fixed the problem. Hopefully this will help someone else experiencing the same problem on OS X.\n\nFrom Bram Luyten (bluyten at gmail.com) Monday,  13 March 2006, 09:37 PM:\n\nI'm still dealing with issues related to this bug.\n\nI've also read: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=27794 and searched google for an answer.\n\n\n\nI'm using  a moodle setup on a server that is not accessible from the outside internet. it's address is http://miro.cs.kuleuven.be:9090/cgmoodle/ we make it available to the outside world, through another machine, as http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.be/cgmoodle/\n\n\n\n==> when i set wwwroot to the first URL, things don't work (like images, ...) because the outside internet doesn't recognize this machine.\n\n\n\n==> when i set wwwroot to the ariadne url, everything works EXCEPT quiz & chat, who give the famous can't instantiate pagelib error.\n\n\n\nCan anyone explain me the procedure to make this work, on a server that is being accessed indirectly from the internet ?\n\nFrom Bram Luyten (bluyten at gmail.com) Monday, 3 April 2006, 07:14 PM:\n\nI upgraded to 1.5.3+\n\nThis didn't solve the issue, however it did change the error message:\n\n\n\nFatal error: Class name must be a valid object or a string in /export/home1/home/ariadne/apache2/htdocs/cgmoodle/lib/pagelib.php on line 67\n\nFrom Bram Luyten (bluyten at gmail.com) Wednesday, 5 April 2006, 04:13 PM:\n\nWe found a dirty workaround:\n\n\n\napperently line 247 in weblib.php says:\n\n$url_prefix = $protocol.$hostname;\n\n\n\nthis gives an incorrect value in a setup where the server is not directly connected to the internet. So we hard coded our web url there.\n\nIssue solved\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Wednesday, 5 April 2006, 04:20 PM:\n\nThanks a lot for reporting this. This may help others in a similar situation.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday, 1 May 2006, 02:33 AM:\n\nThis problem comes up over and over again in the forums. It would really be good if pagelib could find some other way of doing things that is less dependent on the precise setting of wwwroot. I am changing this to a feature request, but leaving it open.\n\nFrom Steve Gale (magpie at phonecoop.coop) Friday, 5 May 2006, 11:16 PM:\n\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm running 1.5.3+ under OSX Tiger Server. I'm experiencing the same problem and have tired both the fix and the dirty hack (and even both at the same time).\n\n\n\nIf I implement the 'fix' I get a 'page timed out' type response (it tries to use :16080 in the url) and moodle page with no images (login page) when I just use http://manxsrv1.cust.phonecoop.coop/moodle.\n\n\n\nIf it implement the 'hack' I still get the fatal error message.\n\n\n\nThe url is http://manxsrv1.cust.phonecoop.coop/moodle\n\n\n\nI tried http://manxsrv1.cust.phonecoop.coop:16080/moodle in the config.php file but no joy.\n\n\n\nFor the hack I changed:\n\n$url_prefix = $protocol.$hostname;\n\n\n\nto \n\n\n\n$url_prefix = $protocol.manxsrv1.cust.phonecoop.coop/moodle;\n\n\n\nand \n\n\n\n$url_prefix = $protocol.manxsrv1.cust.phonecoop.coop:16080/moodle;\n\n\n\nand still got the Fatal Class error.\n\n\n\nAny ideas on this one? I'm new to moodle but not php/mysql or OSX/unix.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nSteve\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday,  11 May 2006, 03:11 PM:\n\nThis has come up again at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=45157 and I am also getting personal emails about this. I am upgrading the severity of this. It may not be a bug but it certainly is creating problems for a lot of people.\n\nFrom Petr Skoda (skodak at centrum.cz) Friday,  12 May 2006, 08:35 PM:\n\nIMHO we should close this report and add a BIG LETTER warning into config-default.php that only one fixed wwwroot is allowed. The only supported solution for LAN/WAN access is to tweak DNS records in LAN to point to internal IP - some doc wiki page could be mentioned there too ;-)\n\n\n\nWe could also note that port numbers are not supported.\n\n\n\nChanging wwwroot on-the-fly breaks backup/restore - IMO there is no point in discussing it anymore, we must educate admins instead.\n\n\n\nskodak\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Saturday,  13 May 2006, 03:12 PM:\n\nThat is a very good suggestion. Such documentation is clearly very sorely needed, there have been more forum posts about this recently. But would it not be possible to change the code at least so much that it gives a more informative error message?\n\nFrom Petr Skoda (skodak at centrum.cz) Saturday,  13 May 2006, 03:28 PM:\n\nI guess it is time to finish Health center, it should be easy to parse config.php and report weird wwwroot settings ;-)\n\nFrom Bram Luyten (bluyten at gmail.com) Thursday,  18 May 2006, 04:42 PM:\n\nThere have been some issues with the dirty workaround that I suggested before.\n\n\n\nThey relate to the behaviour of the me() function in weblib.php\n\n\n\nFor some reason (probably webserver related), $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] returns a FAULTY url with multiple / instead of one /\n\n\n\nyou can try out if this is the case at your setup by including \n\necho $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; somewhere.\n\n\n\nWe got a final fix by changing the following in the me() function in weblib.php\n\n\n\n$darn = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];\n\n$test = str_replace (//, /, $darn);\n\nreturn $test;\n\n\n\ninstead of\n\nreturn $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];\n\n\n\nTogether with the previous dirty workaround that I suggested, this should work.\n\nFrom Petr Skoda (skodak at centrum.cz) Friday,  19 May 2006, 04:20 AM:\n\nI have tried to google for any $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] related problems and did not find any reports, are you sure it is not server misconfiguration?\n\n\n\nCould you send me by email more info about the problematic server - config files for apache, php and moodle?",
      "06/Apr/07 6:59 PM;712020:bdf3c8e6-6f0c-42ff-b9ce-f75f7f9636ef;I have to tell you. First it is difficult to find a Host with the needed space and the current version of MYSQL that supports later versions of Moodle. This is why I need Moodle version 1.5x. After installing Moodle twice on the same hosting plan in the same directory I have one complete working package and one package with the quiz and chat features broken.\n\nHere is how it happens my domain name is http://www.region5nyc.net/moodle. My succesful Moodle install uses this url in the wwwroot.\n\nWhen installing the second Moodle, for testing purposes, I used the following url https://www.region5nyc.net/moodle4. \n\nThe above url https://www.region5nyc.net/ is what my hosting company provides for a dedicated ssl certificate for my domain. I want to run the ssl to scramble inbound traffic from within my education institution which scans outbound and inbound traffic for keywords. So, if a student is loading a word document with the words \"basketball gambling\" to the moodle course from my educational institution the upload will by blocked by the filter. The https:// is the work around.\n\nHowever, https://www.region5nyc.net/moodle4 and http://www.region5nyc.net/moodle4 will point to the same directory. So using commands in the code such as $hostname will not work. When turning on debuging in the admin page I get the following error when try to run a chat:\n\nPage class mapping requested for unknown type: http:--region5nyc.net-moodle4-mod-chat-view\n\nThis is telling me the chat, via the coding, is still hooked on the hostname. http:.\nI would like to use the https: and may abandone the quiz and chat feature because the rewards of file uploads and other Moodel features are far greater. However, if this gets resolved I would certainly love to hear how.\n\n",
      "07/Apr/07 12:34 AM;557058:5188c7d7-5671-48d1-b501-6c3ae2b91f34;If you are having problems getting Moodle set up, you are more likely to get help by posting in an appropraite forum on moodle.org, for example http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=28, than by adding a comment to an ancient bug report.\n\nAlso, plenty of people are able to find hosting that will run the latest version of Moodle. Marting Dougamas is quite insistant that developers do not do anything that raises the minimum system requirement unnecessarily. The increase in MySQL version number in Moodle 1.6 was to handle Unicode properly, which is essential in a application that is used around the world.\n\nWith the recent release of Moodle 1.8, version 1.5 is no longer offically supported, so I would recommed that you think very carefully before starting a new installation based on that version now.\n\n",
      "07/Apr/07 6:58 AM;712020:bdf3c8e6-6f0c-42ff-b9ce-f75f7f9636ef;Tim-\n\nMy only comment is that the MYSQL version 4.1.16 is not available for the $20 a month plans that offer gigabytes of storage such as www.1and1.com and www.mediatemple.com. Please see post at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=38354.\nThe above post is dated January 2006. I still do not see why Moodle version 1.5x is not being supported anymore? \nThe issue is not a problem with the install it is how I explained above. On hosting plans with two domains pointing to the same location such as mentioned above the chat and quiz feature will only work with the primary host. If you could suggest a host with MYSQl version 4.1.16 or better that also offers at least 100 gigabytes of storage let me know and I will attempt a Moodle version that is being supported. ",
      "07/Apr/07 7:24 AM;712020:bdf3c8e6-6f0c-42ff-b9ce-f75f7f9636ef;Tim-\nI'm sorry I sounded critical earlier. I checked out http://www.bluehost.com and the plan sounds right and will support the latest version of Moodle. I will still need to run it behind a SSL sue to my educational institutions filtering system. I'll try it and keep my fingers crossed."

Once we start enabling change this term and change that term for everything where do you draw the line?\n\nFrom   (moodle at martignoni.net) Wednesday, 6 July 2005, 05:10 AM:\n\nI think that these 2 strings are very site-specific (just like teacher or student): at least in the french community (see discussion in course Moodle en fran&#231;ais on moodle.org), every Moodle admin has another term for her own institution ;-)\n\n\n\nI agree that we don't want to make every string changeable, but IMHO this could bring more flexibility to the customization of Moodle for any kind of institution.\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Tuesday,  29 November 2005, 10:58 PM:\n\nI want to extend this request: the customization should not only be at site level but also at course level as it is with teachers and students. cf.\n\n\n\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=35301\n\n\n\nUsing lang-packs is not so simple since this term is sprinkled all around different language strings whereas it should be there as a variable (as in case of teacher and student). \n\n\n\nFor example, in German lang-pack, course is translated as 'Kurs'; howeber, at many universities, people rather call them 'Lehrveranstaltungen' using word 'Kurs' for something more specific. However, 'Kurs' is correct in many other settings.\n\n\n\nWe also have a few courses in Moodle which are not real courses. It would be nice to be able to call them what they really are while all the rest remains as 'courses'.\n\nFrom Robert  (rjb at robelko.com) Tuesday,  29 November 2005, 11:04 PM:\n\nJust wanted to add that while I also agree that there must be a limit of what Moodle allows to customize in the interface these terms, Course, Courses, Course Categories, are in exactly same category as teachers and students and usually should match their variations. Other strings can hopefully become more easily customizable once the local language extensions are implemented\n\n\n\nhttp://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=3355&pos=7\n\nFrom   (scott.elliott at mchsi.com) Wednesday,  30 November 2005, 01:06 PM:\n\nI use moodle for our church website and I would love to stop explaining ...

Basically, a group of unit would comprise the course.  This is different than topics, because when a person creates the unit they may or may not know what course the unit will become part of.\n\nSpecially, I am thinking of my own situation where I am working on my son's curriculum for homeschooling.  I know that I have to teach certain units (eg. \"Ancient Egypt\", \"Creation\", \"Modern Mexico\", \"American Civil War\"\"), but right now I do not know for sure when I am going to teach each unit.  Furthermore, I would like to be able to simple print out a report by units indicating at what grades the unit was taught.  In other words, if somebody was to ask the question, \"When did the child learn Ancient Egypt history\" it could easily be looked up in an index, and the respective unit can be viewed with all of the same items as one would see in a course.\n\nIn other words, I want the ability for a course to have a parent.\n",

When the student presses the submit button this submits a form to the attempt.php script. That script processes the responses and then displays the updated page. How can that script then tell the browser to jump to a particular anchor?\n\nFrom J McC (jonny.mccullagh at gmail.com) Thursday, 7 July 2005, 11:20 PM:\n\nWould it be possible on the attempt.php page to have an anchor for\n\neach question table e.g. <a name=questionid>\n\nThen when the the user clicks Submit to check the answer so I assume\n\nthere is a redirect of some description to reload attempt.php - you\n\ncould change the redirect/reload to point to attempt.php#questionid\n\n\n\nDoes this clarify?\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Thursday, 7 July 2005, 11:30 PM:\n\nNo, there is no redirect, the form is submitted directly to attempt.php.\n\nFrom J McC (jonny.mccullagh at gmail.com) Friday, 8 July 2005, 06:53 PM:\n\nI've looked at the code and I don't think it would be possible with the current format of the quiz. \n\nI had thought that each question had its own form so the the form action could have been set to attempt.php#questionid\n\nbut since it is one big form I don't think that it would be possible easily. Maybe you want to scrub this bug? and offer the possibility of hiding the Submit button for each question - my users are getting confused.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Sunday,  10 July 2005, 02:04 AM:\n\nI think we'll keep this feature request open because it would be really nice if the submit button could jump back to the same position on the page. Perhaps at some point in the future we figure out some way to achieve that.\n\n\n\nUntil such a time the best solution is to put only a single question on each page of the quiz.\n\n\n\nAnd if you don't want your students to submit answers to individual questions then you should set Adaptive mode to No.",

If one wanted to change the order of the groups on the page, there would be no way to do that because in so doing the student responses to their group choice would be lost or at least rearranged.\n\nI don't see a quick solution to this problem if it means being able to move the last choice up to the top and retain the same votes in that choice.  One thing that could and I think should be done though is an option to display choices in random order.  This would eliminate some of the survey bias in static lists.  Such a change would get my vote.  ",
      "27/Oct/09 8:47 PM;712020:d662f414-39d0-4320-800e-ee9aed3c3e86;We use Choices for scheduling assignment presentations, where only one time-slot is available for each response. If we add more choices, they need to be added at the end (or we lose the students selections) - it would be better to be able to move the new choice to a new order rather than at the bottom.\n\nAlso, when the Choice Responses are downloaded, the order seems to be random - it would be good if the responses were downloaded in the same order as they are displayed. Perhaps they are related to the time the response is selected and written to the database?",

    "Description": "In the quiz module, it is possible to specify that a multiple-choice question has either 1 correct answer, or else more than one.  This then determines if radio buttons or tick boxes are used for the answer selection.\n\n\n\nHowever, consider the scenario where there are a number of questions that have four possible responses, only two of which are correct.\n\n\n\nYou assign 50% of the mark to each correct answer, and assign no mark at all to the incorrect answers.\n\n\n\nEnter smart-alec student, who selects *all* of the possible responses for each question, and thus achieves a 100% mark on his first attempt without actually knowing anything.\n\n\n\nNow it *is* possible to assign a negative mark to the incorrect responses to try and discourage the above behaviour, but some of the teachers don't like this because it interferes with them being able to see easily what the total mark was for correct answers.\n\n\n\nWould it be possible to modify the quiz module so that, when a MCQ is created, that has more than one correct answer, the teacher creating the question can specify the maxmum number of responses allowed for that question?\n\n\n\nIn the above example, that would mean that of the four possible responses, a maximum of two could be selected.\n\n\n\nI realise that this would probably involve some more javascript, in order to make the interface nice, which would make the thing less accessible than it should be.\n\n\n\nOr perhaps the number of responses on each question could be checked before final submission, and the submission rejected if any question has more than the permitted number of responses?\n\n\n\nI hope I've managed to make this clear and haven't just rambled.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think, Gustav?\n\n\n\n\n\nSean K",

In other assessment systems I know the marks for incorrect choices are applied automatically.\n\n\n\nI am not sure I think your solution of specifying the correct number of choices is always the most desirable solution. The teacher may want the student to have to figure out by themselves how many correct answers there are.",

This approach is very flexible too. :-)",

This is something that is now coming up in every training session as an issue. If it's under consideration (I noticed Tim has just changed the item title) IMO there should still be the option for students to be able to tick any number of options and not have the maximum forced for each question of this type.",
      "07/Mar/07 7:00 AM;712020:0bfc83c2-7539-4274-a573-e797e260571d;I posted a new feature request yesterday (MDL-8766), and then Tim Hunt 'resolved it' as a duplicate of this one. I made the suggestion that it could work something like this:\n\n- You would choose MULTIPLE CHOICE from the CREATE NEW QUESTION drop down list. \n- You would choose MULTIPLE ANSWERS ALLOWED in the ONE OR MULTIPLE ANSWERS drop down list. \n- There would be a new drop down list called LIMIT MULTIPLE ANSWERS, and the choices in this drop down list would be either UNLIMITED or LIMIT TO POSITIVE GRADES.\n- If you choose UNLIMITED, then there would be no change in the functionality of the question, and it would continue to work as it does now, allowing the student to choose any or all the answers listed. \n- If you choose LIMIT TO POSITIVE GRADES, then upon pressing the SAVE CHANGES button, it will count the number of answers with a positive grade, and set the limit of answers that can be choosen to this number. Minimum number for this limit should be 1, even if there are zero answers with positive grades. \n\nThe problem we noticed was what Sean mentioned above, about 'smart-alec student' picking all the answers, and still getting full marks. Our workaround solution was to set all grades for incorrect answers to -100%, which means that if the student picks even one wrong answer, they get zero marks for the question. We would preferably like to give partial marks for the correct ones, and not deduct any marks for incorrect, so hopefully this is a feature that will be implemented soon!!!",

      "09/Jul/08 6:40 PM;557058:ad4396bc-c0c2-4271-b0a9-df80010113dc;Laia - Where I think you could do some research that would be helpful is with each of the activities. There needs to be some rationale for determining what is an advanced option. How do default values for advanced options get set? At what level should those settings be implemented (site, course, user)? Ideally I would like to see some type of interface where by the system administrator can determine whether a particular field is considered advanced or basic and define a default value. Further refining may involve providing the ability to set a context for that particular default. That would mean that for courses created in one particular context the system admin could set a default value for a particular course setting (say the enrollment key and make it advanced) and set an different default enrollment key for another category. Similarly, for a particular user, the admin could make an particular option basic so that it appears for them because they use it frequently but for the rest of the users make it advanced. Of course I realize implementing this would add an additional level of abstraction but it would put the system admin in control of the user's experience. I think ti could be debated whether this would ultimately improve or complicate usability since each user could have a different experience. But I think this would be worth discussing among the users (or at least initially among the developers). Peace - Anthony",

Perhaps there is already a forum post about it?\n\nFrom Olaf Rempel (razzor at kopf-tisch.de) Tuesday,  30 August 2005, 05:53 AM:\n\nWith this patch, the navbar for quizpages (page 1 2 3 4 ...) will be an per quiz config option.\n\n\n\nSo one can build a quiz where it is not possible to jump between questions (think of one question per page).\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Tuesday,  30 August 2005, 06:23 AM:\n\nWhat happens when they revisit the attempt. Will they start at page 1 again or on the page they were last on? I guess it will have to be the later because otherwise they could still navigate between pages, it would only be more tedious. If you do have a mechanism for letting them continue on the page they were last on then that will be useful in general. \n\nFrom Olaf Rempel (razzor at kopf-tisch.de) Wednesday,  31 August 2005, 02:53 AM:\n\n> What happens when they revisit the attempt. Will they start at page 1 again or on the page they were last on?\n\n\n\nUnfortunately they start on page 1 again. \n\nSo this fix is not *complete* and I was not able to find a solution for this :(\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday,  13 February 2006, 04:21 AM:\n\nBecause of the problem that new attempts always start on page 1 again I don't think this will ever make it into the core distribution. I am therefore closing this feature request.",

Seems like an odd decision to me. An 'internal' user should (surely) be able to change their own password.\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Tuesday,  16 August 2005, 11:51 PM:\n\n...and the other problem with the change password, seems to be that the change password url is returned for the *default* authentication method (LDAP on this site) rather than the user's authentication method as recorded in their auth field. This in login/index.php around line 125 (//Select password change url)\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Wednesday,  17 August 2005, 06:45 PM:\n\nOk - there were a couple of bugs. The login/index.php picked up the password change url for the *default* authentication not the one that was set for the actual user (ie, it wouldn't work for manual authentication users if some external method was selected). There was also a further bug in the password change routine were the force password change flag was not cleared.\n\n\n\nOn the other point, the user can change their password via a button on their profile screen. There is no requirement for this to be duplicated on the main profile screen.\n\n\n\nFixed in CVS. Closing.\n\nFrom Samuli Karevaara (samuli.karevaara at lamk.fi) Monday,  30 January 2006, 09:06 PM:\n\nI wasn't sure if to add a new bug or reopen this one...\n\n\n\nIn both the block_admin.php and /user/view.php there is a test\n\n    if (is_internal_auth() ...snip...\n\n    ...then show the change password link/button.\n\n\n\nThe function checks for the site main authentication method only, thus the manually added users can't change their password if the main auth method is not an internal one.\n\n\n\nSuggested fix: change the if to\n\n    if (is_internal_auth($USER->auth) ...snip...\n\n\n\nin the files mentioned above.\n\n\n\nMartin L. mentioned in another bug, that with this kind of mixed auth methods you should not expect it to work correctly, as it is not a supported scenario.\n\n\n\nSo I have put this as a Feature Request instead of a bug...\n\nFrom Howard Miller (howard.miller at udcf.gla.ac.uk) Monday,  30 January 2006, 10:59 PM:\n\nI'll take a look!",

I would think this would be fairly simple to do and would greatly enhance the flexibility of how forums can be used in a classroom setting.

I agree with D.I. that it would be nice if there were an option in the forum (when it is being created/updated) that the gradebook could check if it exists (i.e. accumulation=average, max, etc.) then use that accumulation in the gradebook. But then we get into a which option should override which. I'm not sure how the quiz module handles it. I suspect that if the forum one was used it could be seen as force forum aggregation setting to gradebook where one of the options is none - use gradebook aggregation. \n\nA particular case that may be worth looking at is what happens when the ratings are 1-10 and a user gets 3 ratings of 10 by the teacher. The teacher then uses the sum aggregation. Is there a check to ensure that the aggregation does not exceed to the forum's max rating? \n\nPeace - Anthony\n\np.s. - I'm of the opinion that since the functionality of this request can be achieved in Moodle 1.9 that it be marked as resolved and fixed for Moodle 1.9.",

When you grade you want to see the stuff in front of you - you're looking at the assignment results, and giving grades. I only go to the gradebook to try and deduce what students are missing...\n\nBut regardless, anything that would allow the averaging thing to be resolved (since when my TA gives partial credit I'm unable to give it full credit later - it averages) so that the max score counts is a big help! Sounds like the gradebook will do that.\n\nFWIW I don't think this is trivial (as marked here) at all - since it's caused us a bit of grief, and I have to modify the way we grade to deal with it.\ndi",

When I was speaking of averages I was assuming the student had made numerous posts. This raises another issue. Could we have the max grade from a particular post and the average of those max grades from various posts made by a student.\n\nJust to be clear, an example may help. Let's say I have student A, the beloved T.A., and me the teacher. Student A goes in and makes posts 1, 2, and 3. The T.A. gives post 1 a score of 5 (out of 10), the teacher gives it and 7. On post 2, the ta gives a 1 and the teacher a 3. On post 3, the ta gives an 6 and the teacher a 8.\n\nSo we would want the max from each post. Post 1=7, post 2=3, post 3=8. Now in the gradebook we want the average of those 3 posts which would be (7+3+8)/3=6. \n\nShould there be an option to handle max, average, min, etc. within posts for the case when there are multiple teachers rating the post? Should there be an option to allow student ratings to be used for the grade? I can see this getting more complicated. \n\nI agree that this is not a trivial issue. I'll bump it up a notch.

      "10/Dec/07 7:45 PM;712020:f15fbb21-60c7-428b-9a94-37d637625a28;Anthony- thanks for your attention.\nI agree that we are referring to two different things- but I think they are worth considering.\n\nCurrently there is only one grading scheme on the forums- anything not graded is null, and anything graded on a single FORUM (regardless of threads or topics) is averaged across all who have given grades. This creates a number of problems, most of which have been alluded to here:\n\n-if resubmissions are allowed (as in my case) how does a different grader give full score (it can never be full score if the initial grade was low)\n-if there is a \"post to this, reply to that\" option, things are further complicated - you are in effect trying to grade two different things in one forum. The only way out of this that I can conceive of us to differentiate initial posts from replies. While this sounds really sexy, it feels like a low priority at this juncture. It's hard to say though- i've not done these kinds of assignments for this very reason- there's no way to grade them easily, and the workarounds are too painful for large numbers of students.  Having said that, i'm really liking the idea of differentiating posts from replies the more I think about it!! Lots of interestinng options\n-if there are multiple posts to grade, averaging might make sense, but there's no easy way to differentiate 3 posts from 1 - if you take the max, or the average... the single poster does as well or better than the triple poster. The only way I can see around this is to have a function that counts the posts, or have settings that relate to the number of posts (i.e. instead of \"each person posts a single discussion\" you have \"each person posts (drop down) discussions\" and then have scoring options based on that.\n-but back to my original supposition, if we simply duplicated the test options (min, max, average) it would be a HUGE step forward, and make my life a lot easier.  In fact, with tests you can specify between 1 and 6 attempts, or unlimited. Why not do the very same with forums? You can post X number of times, and the grade is min, max, or ave.\n\nAs I think about this (sorry) you could work around some of this by an option making posts automatically have zero or something like a 1, so that it would allow the math to do its thing instead of ignoring unrated posts- these low scores could then be adjusted as items are graded.\n\nPeer grading brings up a whole other set of issues, but again, if we can focus on what people need and use most we may be able to satisfy 80 pct of the needs with 20pct of the effort.\n\ndi\n\nps- after all this it's worth noting that the only reason I do use the forums so often for homework is that I like for students to see each other's work- in webpages i want them to see what the others have done (the forum is simply a link to their site) and in programming they might attach a zip of their files. The ONLY reason i don't just use assignments is I want them to be public so classmates can look at each others work. \n\nWe are using 1.54 right now (upgrading to 1.8 over xmas) so I presume roles might address this in some regard - but using roles seems like hardly a fix for design fixes...\n",
      "10/Dec/07 10:00 PM;557058:ad4396bc-c0c2-4271-b0a9-df80010113dc;di - I'm afraid I was not able to follow your last comment. I agree that there is great potential to make forums even more useful and the grading easier for the teacher. I think what I proposed about making a distinction between the number of ratings on a single post and the number of posts within a discussion could be implemented without an extreme amount of work. I'm not sure I understood the advantage of distinguishing between a reply and a post. From a teacher's perspective I do know that I encouraged quality over quantity. I wanted each student to at least make one substantial post in response to a question that I proposed; however, I wanted them to feel free to make smaller, supportive posts and to respond to their classmates. For that reason, I would use max.; however, I had designed a custom sql script since I had access to the database to put the data into a separate offline assignment. Obviously, this was a lot of work and not available to most teachers. My general sense with changes is that it is best to introduce one change at a time and to take things slowly. At this point, I would be happy to see the flexibility to establish different ways of aggregating ratings on a single post and various posts within a forum discussion. I do think with a little effort we can cover 95% of the cases. I'm all for making the largest gains with the least effort. Basically, I think we are 99% in agreement. I will see if I can play with some of the code and perhaps work on making some type of patch available (however, if one of the developers beats me to it - all the better). Peace - Anthony\n",

I think we're in agreement that KISS is critical. \n\nTo clarify my point, although I do not think anyone should worry about it right now, I'll say the following: I think a typical assignment might include a post, and then 2 replies on other students' posts. So if you make the forum worth 20, and give 10 for the initial post, and 5 for each reply, it really makes setting up a grading scheme tricky. Under the current setup (assuming max score) it would average 10, 5 and 5 to give you 6. something. If you upped the max to 20, you'd get the same. You could theoretically curve it to something to compensate, but that's just mucky muck. So the idea would be, suppose you could grade the post the student ORIGINATES one way, and any replies another way. This would account for the scenario you described, but as you've alluded to, might even need two entries in the gradebook!\n\nSo no worries on this angle right now! \n\nd.i.",

The name of the field is to be consistent with the assess fields already in the forum and the aggregate vocabulary associated with the gradebook. \n\nThe patch is meant to demonstrate my basic line of thought for how we could add some increased flexibility to the scoring of forums. It does not seem to be taking advantage of the $user variable but that could simply be because I was logged in as admin rather than teacher. I'll need to go back and do a little more thorough testing. \n\nI would also like to see where the gradebook items get reset if the assessaggregate field is changed. In other words, changing the forum aggregate type needs to trigger a re-calculation of the scores for each student. It might be helpful to add another variable to include or not include student ratings or only teacher ratings. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. \n\nPeace - Anthony",

That will provide automatically backwards compatibility (upgrade, backup & restore...).\n\n- While looking to the patch, one question arrived to my mind, \"what happens when the aggregation type is changed?\" Is everything recalculated automatically? It should, IMO (or we can have really out-of-sync data in the gradebook).

As development of the code continues, sometimes it is helpful branch the code so that we have a separate version to work on. To fix something in version 1.9 we work on the 19STABLE branch and to fix something for the current development version (which is currently 2.0) we work on the HEAD branch. So to say that it was fixed in 1.9 and 2.0 means that the changes were applied to both the 19STABLE branch and HEAD (so that it will be in future releases). The nightly build for the 1.9 beta takes a snapshot of the 19STABLE branch and puts it into a zip file. I'm not sure if the most recent changes will be in the zip or tar files of the latest 19STABLE branch but you can be assured that after 24 hours they will be . Thanks for your patience.

I've got 103 students in one class, and i want to give each a grade AND a reply on each forum (and I have about 35 forums) and just that little issue would really really help, without over-complicating things.\n\nBasically it would be a process to kick off the same thing that hitting the rate button does now, but then kick of the process that the reply link does just after that. \n\nThis is actually a separate  feature request: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-10324 which Martin seems to have pegged as for 2.0... but couldn't we simply make that tiny little change (add a button that rates and loads reply window) while we're here already?\n\nd.i.\n\nps- did i say I'd give $100 for this?

In the user outline activity report, if a lesson is set for retakes the date of the first attempt is shown, rather than the date of the last attempt.\n\n\n\n2.  I'm not sure what the future holds for the essays--but, it would be great if they acted more like the online assignments, in that the student can re-attempt them (in other words, they can go back and review or update them).  The way they are now, once a student submits an essay it disappears and they have no way of reviewing it unless the teacher emails it to them.\n\n\n\n3.  Relating to 2. above it would also help if when a user does update an essay (retake), it (again like online asssignment) would replace the previous attempt--that way the teacher doesn't see so many essay links to grade.\n\n\n\nYou guys have really made Ray's module much more usable--thanks.",

    "Description": "In reality, there are 3 different things:\n\n\n\n   1) subjects (e.g. Informatics for beginners, Macroeconomics etc.)\n\n   2) concrete classes (e.g. Macroeconomics on Tuesday, teached by Mr. XY in classroom 26B with these 20 students, Macroeconomics on Wednesday, teached by Mrs. YZ in classroom 115A with another 20 students)\n\n   3) groups (e.g. project groups, each group has 5 students)\n\n\n\nYou have subjects, classes and groups but Moodle implements just classes (courses in Moodle's terminology) and groups. This has some implications to course management - currently it's quite hard to create many concrete classes of one subject that share some common learning materials, polls, surveys etc. One proposed solution is to backup and restore one course to another but then you have troubles when you need to change something in all courses.\n\n\n\nHow to deal with this problem? My suggestion is to create some course template. It would be a normal course with resources, surveys and other activities, but without teachers and students. From this template, you'd create concrete courses with two options:\n\n\n\n   1. linked copy option, which means that every update in the template course would also update every derived course, and\n\n   2. hard copy option, which means that updates to the template course has no impact on the derived concrete course\n\n\n\nFor more information, see these two discussion topics:\n\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=29025\n\nhttp://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=28994",

This feature request also suggests one technical solution but the main problem is that Moodle doesn't map well to a real world (it definitely should!). Course template is intuitive technical solution but maybe it should be called something like subject (I'm not a native English speaker so I don't know the propper term).

So in particular the list of forum posts and the activities list will look different. These links have worked like that since they were introduced a long time back and I believe they work the way Martin intended. You could however start a discussion on the forums to see if there is consensus that it should be changed.\n\nFrom James Dugal (jpd at louisiana.edu) Saturday,  27 August 2005, 12:51 PM:\n\nYes, I see what you mean!  And after I do change to a different course context, I can pick the course from the breadcrumb trail, and click to switch to that course.  I'm trying to adjust to Moodle-isms having come from a 5-year Blackboard context!\n\n--James",

Currently, as of 1.6 beta 5 the /lib/datalib.php contains a function get_users_listing where around line 1810 it currently sets the value of the $select variable as follows:\n\n\n\n$select .=  AND ($fullname $LIKE '%$search%' OR email $LIKE '%$search%') ;\n\n\n\nas you can see this is just the first and last name field that is being searched. We use a five digit student id to identify our students and sometimes it would be helpful to search by the student id. In particular I am thinking of how to check which student is having login failures from the logs. \n\n\n\nI have customized the code on my production server with:\n\n\n\n$select .=  AND ($fullname $LIKE '%$search%' OR email $LIKE '%$search%' OR username $LIKE '$search%') ;\n\n\n\nIdeally I would like to limit the number of customizations and hence I am re-opening this feature request. To that end, I have changed the version from 1.5.2 to 1.6 beta 5 and the OS from Solaris to all. I also changed the resolution from works for me to reopened. Thank you for your consideration and for all you do to make Moodle Moodle-tastic!\n\nFrom Anthony Borrow (aborrow at jesuitcp.org) Tuesday, 8 August 2006, 12:03 AM:\n\nMartin - I have changed the to be closed in version to 1.7 as I think this would be a nice, easy addition to 1.7. The code change is very minor and included in the feature request. It is just a matter of writing it to CVS. Thanks for your consideration - Anthony.",

      "01/Sep/07 2:43 AM;557058:8cc55ef3-2ca2-4d32-a948-5d663af55525;This is still not working for 1.8.2 as far as I can tell. There are lots of instances where username and idnumber are more relevant search criteria then name or email as unique identifiers. Other categories may be altered by the user to reflect user preferences (such as Anthony shortened to Tony) and so are less reliable.\n\nIdeally both should be included but idnumber is seems the more relevant field as most enrolment features utilise this and it is often directly tied to other systems.",

      "18/Sep/07 7:59 AM;557058:ad4396bc-c0c2-4271-b0a9-df80010113dc;Martin - The ability to search for users by username has been floating around for a while. Any thoughts on what you might like to do with this. I've also done a similar modification to /admin/roles/assign.php to search the username field. A neat improvement would be to allow the user to select which user fields (including the new user defined profile fields) they would like included to be searched for. That would give the site admin control to search as best works for that particular site without having to modify the code. If you would like me to work on developing a patch to accomplish this let me know but I don't want to put in the time or effort if it is not going to be used.

    "Description": "Encountered a problem for grading Essay Questions.\n\nTo reproduce the problem:\n0. Edit the essay question type so that the method is_usable_by_random returns true.\n1. Add a random question to a quiz and select category X for the random question.\n2. In category X only have Essay Question(s)\n3. Take the quiz as a student.\n4. Go to the Manual Grading Tab as a Teacher and you will find that there are no essay questions to grade.\n\nThis is because of how the code checks for essay questions in the quiz.  Go to line 256 in grading.php to see how it does this.\n\nThe random question type causes a lot of problems for grading Essay Questions because if the random question is pulling from Essays and non-essays then not every student will answer the question.\n\nSo, the method for how the grading code looks for essay questions in a quiz and the interface for grading essay questions need to be altered.  I'm not entirely sure how random questions work so I am stuck on this problem at the present time.\n\nAnother solution is to add ESSAY to the excludedtypes array in random question type.",

Then the grading code will no longer need to be able to identify all essay questions, it will simply list all questions in the quiz.\n\nFrom Gustav Delius (gwd2 at york.ac.uk) Monday, 6 February 2006, 06:56 AM:\n\nFor now I have simply added essay questions to the list of excluded questions for random questions. This is probably the most sensible thing to do anyway given that essay questions are quite a bit different from the other questions.\n\nFrom Anthony Borrow (aborrow at jesuitcp.org) Sunday, 5 March 2006, 04:57 AM:\n\nWhile the issue of not being able to grade random essay questions may be fixed by excluding essay questions from the available random list, I would like to make sure that it does not disappear from the radar screen. If it is ok, I would like to reopen this and change it to a feature request. I think the ability to choose from a category of random essay questions is helpful and would be a great feature.",

My comment above on 21st Sept is accurate, but maybe a bit cryptic.\n\nThis diagram may help a bit http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Quiz_database_structure\n\nLooking at Paulo's patch, it basically adds an OR clause to the SQL to find random questions in categories that contain essay questions. \n\nWhat it fails to take into account are random questions that pick from a category and all the child categories (this is indicated by questiontext='1' for the random question), and where the essay questions are in the child categories, not the to level category. Bear in mind that the child categories can be nested to arbitrary depth. It should be possible (but hard) to extend the SQL to cover this case. \n\nNote that the random question type makes use of the question_categorylist function from questionlib to get a list of the relevant categories, but this is recursive, and only works for one question at a time, so cannot be directly used in the query.",

This will help us plan activities better, as we often refer to some event that should happen, e.g. a holiday in week 40 means we need do something before or after that. ",

Would it be possible for you to create a patch file with these changes? That would make them much easier to work with. Please see http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:How_to_create_a_patch.\n\n2. Instead of telling people to edit the database themselves, you should use Moodle's self-update mechanism, which involves editing question/type/multichoice/db/install.xml, and adding a chunk of code to .../db/upgrade.xml. Both of those two steps should be done using Moodle's built in XMLDB editor. Then you need to update the version number in .../version.php. See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Installing_and_upgrading_plugin_database_tables.\n\n3. I think the default in the database should be 0.\n\n4. I think you need to disable the all-or-nothing scoring option on the form if it is a single choice question. Look up the disabledIf method.\n\n5. I don't think we should have question-type specific UI on the question import form. Is there another way to handle this?\n\nAlso, please could I ask you to introduce yourself. I like to know who I am working with, and as far as I can see, you don't have a profile on the main http://moodle.org/ site.\n\nThanks for contributing to Moodle. Tim (quiz maintainer)",
      "05/Apr/09 11:52 PM;712020:552863ed-a46e-42d7-bb50-195fa0157341;Good morning Tim,\n\nYou can find my profile at:\n\nhttp://moodle.org/user/view.php?id=570753&course=5\n\nWe are using Moodle as a second LMS here at the University of Vienna, so it's a smaller installation, but this all-or-nothing code is tested and no one ever complained.\n\nI can create the patch. Point 1 to 4 is clear and logical. The only problem I have is point 5. This is something I recently added. I can think of three possible solutions:\n\n1. Take the default value: This is what we had before and it wasn't very handy. People imported their questions and then they called the support to change the value in the database (doesn't matter if the default is 0 or 1).\n\n2. Add the flag to the import and export formats: This is what I did for Moodle-XML. It is easy to extend XML, but how should I add it to GIFT?\n\n3. Add a flag to the UI on the import form as described: I added this because it is needed. When you import 50 questions you don't want to set the flag for all these questions after the import just because you don't want the default value.\n\nMy question is: Is there a possibility to add the flag to the GIFT format? I could create the code but who defines the standards? Using the default value was the easiest way, adding the flag to the import UI is maybe another lousy solution. I could dig through all the import/export formats and try to find out if they have the flag but I think GIFT is the most important, many people use it and we should have a solution for this first.\n\nKind regards\nRichard ",
      "06/Apr/09 1:19 AM;557058:5188c7d7-5671-48d1-b501-6c3ae2b91f34;Actually, the issue you identify is already a problem with some other options, for example shuffle answers for MC, matching and so on. So I suppose there is an alternate point of view that says we should have more question type specific UI in the import process.\n\nAnd thinking about it, in an ideal world, the import process would have a wizard user interface, so\n1. On the first page you select the format to import.\n2. On the second page, you select the file to import, and we can now only show files of the type you are interested in.\n... Moodle then scans the file you selected, to see which types of questions it contains, and as a result, which questions the user should be asked, so that the user does not get asked about irrelevant options.\n3. The user is presented with a list of options that might affect the import.\n\nThat is, of course, quite a big change. I just started dreaming.\n\n\nIn the mean time, it is probably OK to add some options to the import form, particularly if we cover options like shuffleanswers too.\n\n\nAbout the formats. Moodle XML format should always contain full information about the question to be imported and exported, so you were right to add the new option. However, in your code, it must still work on import if that bit of XML is missing, in order to be backwards compatible. You will find other examples of that in the code that you can copy.\n\nGIFT is defined by Moodle. It is OK to propose a change, but again it is very important that the change is forwards and backwards compatible. The best way to propose it is to post in the quiz forum: moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?f=121",
      "07/Apr/09 10:36 PM;712020:552863ed-a46e-42d7-bb50-195fa0157341;I think, the only thing in a GIFT file that will be ignored by older Moodle versions is a comment line, so I added three different comments to my GIFT encodings:\n\n//shuffleanswers:\n//usecase:\n//allornothing:\n\nThese comments can be followed by yes or no. I think the risk that someone writes a comment like this by accident is very small. All these flags can be overruled in the import form. The default value for allornothing is 0 now, so older import packages and new export packages on older Moodle installations should work as before. I have tested this for Moodle-XML and GIFT.\n\nI have commented out the line for disabledif in edit_multichoice_form.php for two reasons: It didn't work with advcheckbox, I think there is a bug in the QuickForm code, the function  getPrivateName() should be removed. And it does no harm. Questions with only one correct answer are always all or nothing, no matter if you click the flag or not. This is logical, but not for every one. Having this option disabled will lead to unnecessary support (there is something wrong with my computer, I cannot click this option...).\n\nDatabase update is in the attached cvs patch. If you are still missing something, just let me know.\n\nBest regards from Vienna\nRichard\n",

However it offers no checking / validation when creating the scaled / cropped image.  It automatically assumes support is present for Jpegs.\n\n\n\nAt the very least the ImageJpeg functions [197-198] should be wrapped inside a control stucture that checks for the the ability to create Jpeg images.  Further development should see output in alternative formats - primarily outputting to PNG (obviously will require changes to filename)",

However, I've put something like it in CVS for consistency's sake.\n\n\n\nAs you correctly said, a proper solution would be to support PNG as an alternative (would cause some pain).  Another would be to document GD/JPEG as a requirement (IIRC it used to be, actually, but must have been lost in a documementation revision along the way).  Either way, we need to have SOME sort of external dependency to get image processing working.",

With the upgraded version (1.5) only points are shown.  For each assignment, we can hae a customized grade scale, yet when it is viewed in teh gradebook, nothing is listed.  For my university, specifically, we would like the option to view letter grades (with plus and minus also).  I have read in forums that other are also requesting this.. I saw one for complete/incomplete.\n\n\n\nBasically the request comes down to having a customized gradebook--- and viewing it as is.\n\n\n\nthanks!",

Meta courses are all very well but one course can have up to about 30 different instances (and hence codes) in our SIS. This means creating 30 hidden child courses just to get all the students enrolled! To make matters worse the students can see the hidden courses and think there's something wrong when they can't get into them.\n\nIt would also be useful if groups could be created and students put in them automatically when a course has enrolments from several different child courses or codes.",

My idea was more that the first item in the file should specify the category for the rest of the file. I am concerned, though, that somebody importing a file that they did not create might get a surprise if the import 'disappears' into some category they didn't expect. \n\nWould you have the export process add this category information?",
      "31/Oct/06 6:19 AM;712020:6373ec6e-2a10-4a86-9493-052782609013;Hi Howard, \nThank you for reconsidering this one. \n\nFor a start category per file would relieve question makers of the task of making a category and that would be nice in itself. Multipel category statmenents (not necessarily per question but to \"including the following\", perhaps XML-ishly until a delimiter) would be even better because it would allow the simultaneous import of many categories.\n\nThe category that questions have been added to could be highlighted on the report page (the page that says 10 questions have been imported) so that people would be less likely to worry about where the question dissappeared to. \n\nI guess perhaps if export were supported to there should be the option of including category information or not with the default being not. This again would make it less likely that questions would disappear. If on the other hand all questions were exported with the category then...yes... I can see that being a problem for importers. \n\nI think that the export is considerably less important than the import but greed knows no bounds. \n\nThanks again, \n\nTimothy\n\n",
      "31/Oct/06 9:15 AM;712020:ad2b5cc1-3b42-4b54-a8b7-54d6da0ce992;I prepare GIFT files with approximately 60 questions in each.  The files correspond to tests that cover many different categories.  Currently, I import into a \"wash\" category and then re-categorize the questions one-by-one.  It takes about as much time to do recategorize as it takes to create the GIFT file itself.  Being able to categorize at the file level would offer absolutely no advantage for me.  To avoid the double work, question-level categorization is needed.  I am sure that this is a use case for other quiz users.  It should be considered when adding a new feature.",

I create the categories first (often using navicat, or a client side moodle) and then populate these categories with lots of small GIFT files. \n\nI used to use large GIFT files to a wash category but\n1) I still had to create the destination categories\n2) I still had to move the questions to their respective categories, as opposed to creating small GIFT files and then upload to the respective categories. \n\n(1) is the same whether one uses a wash category or not. \n\nBut in respect of (2) I have to do two things - create small GIFT files and then upload them seperately to their respective category, as opposed to just moving questions that I had uploaded at once. So why did I go for the mini GIFT file approach?\n\nI think that it was because I made mistakes in the online  sorting process. I decided to get things sorted out on the client side and then upload. \n\nSo perhaps John is more sussed than me and he can handled the movement of questions to categories.\n\nFrom my point of view, obviously I would prefer it if it were possible to upload one file that contained all the categories and questions. But the ability to avoid category creation and just make lots of small GIFT files would obviously be an advantange in that I would not have to create the categories. \n\nBut this would be of little advantage to John. \n\nI agree that question level (or XML type delimited question bracketing - althought this goes against the grain of the GIFT standard) would be vastly preferable. We would then just create one file on the client side, upload it, and all would be done. \n\nThat would be dreamy. ",

      "10/Oct/05 5:47 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Urs Hunkler (u.hunkler at elearningkontor.de) Saturday, 8 October 2005, 10:05 PM:\n\nNicole, your report sounds great.\n\n\n\nYou report noticeable faster load times. Because the CSS is cached in your browser the page should only be loaded faster when you enter your Moodle site. Or can you measure faster loading pages every time?\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Sunday, 9 October 2005, 12:00 AM:\n\nI am on broadband so I am mostly judging by the reports I'm getting from the speed report on websiteoptimization.com (which is included in the Firefox developer toolbar). It's too hard for me to tell how it would be on dialup but the files that are being served up are definitely smaller.\n\n\n\nI also just came across another related hack for the js files that I just implemented. I cheated a bit on this one, because I also used a tool to strip out all the comments and white space in the js files in Moodle, but by implementing this hack, I was also able to reduce my file size served up a lot. With the two hacks, plus removing the comments, I was able to reduce the size of my pages from 99k to 29k (which means my pages should load on 56k modem in 6.15 seconds, versus the original which was about 19 seconds). \n\n\n\nThe js hack is here:\n\n\n\nhttp://wyome.com/index.php?aid=362&ptid=2&module=articles&func=display\n\n\n\nI just added the second snippet of code to the existing htaccess file in my lib folder. I had to change its name to .htaccess as it wouldn't work with the original name but that may just be my server.\n\n\n\nIn both cases I also increased the time from 60 minutes (as suggested in one of the comments on the first page) as I am not updating either my css or js that often.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Sunday, 9 October 2005, 12:04 AM:\n\nI just switched back to the commented js files and it still gives me a small page size: 32k, down from the 99k original.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Sunday, 9 October 2005, 12:11 AM:\n\nOf course, these need to be tested on a variety of browsers to see if they work everywhere, but I've tested it in Firefox, IE6 and Opera on Windows and it works with all of them.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Sunday, 9 October 2005, 12:35 AM:\n\nI've found one problem. If you go to:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.glyphdoctors.com/mod/forum/search.php?id=5&search=search\n\n\n\nYou will see that the header with the number of search results is not centered. It was centered without the compression, but with the compression it isn't.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Sunday, 9 October 2005, 12:38 AM:\n\nAnd if I look at the CSS with the developer tool, I notice this message:\n\n\n\n<b>Warning</b>:  ob_start(): output handler 'ob_gzhandler' conflicts with 'zlib output compression'\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Sunday, 9 October 2005, 12:45 AM:\n\nI fixed the centering problem, but not in an ideal way. Since the centering was the first class called in the css file, I figured perhaps the problem had to do with it being the first, since there seemed to be no effect on any other aspects of the css. So I created a dummy class that doesn't actually exist on my site and placed it as the first one in the file and it fixed the problem, at least visually, if not technically.\n\nFrom non non (nbhansen at midway.uchicago.edu) Sunday, 9 October 2005, 02:32 AM:\n\nFound another problem with the js compression scheme. It makes the html editor disappear, which is a big problem, and I don't know a solution for it at the moment.\n\nFrom Martin Dougiamas (martin at moodle.com) Sunday, 9 October 2005, 09:47 PM:\n\nI've looked into this in the past.\n\n\n\nFirstly, the stylesheets and Javascripts have purposely been designed to cache nicely, so you only need to load them once anyway. Compressing them only helps on the first page load.\n\n\n\nSecondly, there are modules for Apache like mod_gzip that will compress all pages on the server before sending - it adds a small overhead to the server but I think it's worth it. In fact I have been running it for some years on this very server. However, most people recommend specifically excluding css and js files from compression because older browsers have trouble with them.",
      "05/Dec/06 3:22 PM;712020:8506fcce-a522-4844-ad33-6c5cde829e5a;Given that most hosts implement mod_gzip or mod_deflate, as Martin suggests, this could break some browsers especially if double compression is employed, i.e. apache and php compression. Downloading PDF files is particularly susceptible. Now closed - but please re-open if necessary. Thanks."

As we should be using the messaging api ([https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...marcghaly:master_MDL-4188#diff-12d9847f4d888f39c7b0e44674569441ba20296aab2f38c8e355ec0dbf651134R50] )\r\n * Also minor but it’s worth getting into the habit of only requesting fields for a record that you are actually going to use instead of getting “*”. We did some analysis a while back that indicate for every 1MB of data that gets passed to a user in Moodle there was 4MB of DB traffic ([https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...marcghaly:master_MDL-4188#diff-9e8d4997e8089f9c76a86eecc813a2a0cd0ab897231522c628e32c5b4bdebcfaR543] )\r\n * This is exactly what we don’t want to be doing. We want to use the Moodle messaging API instead ([https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...marcghaly:master_MDL-4188#diff-9e8d4997e8089f9c76a86eecc813a2a0cd0ab897231522c628e32c5b4bdebcfaR576])\r\n * There are a few method and variable names we want to change from “email” to message to better reflect what is happening. i.e sending a welcome message, not a welcome email.\r\n * It would be good to move the new: `email_welcome_message` and ‘get_welcome_email_contact’ (once they’ve been renamed to remove email), to the base `auth_plugin` class. This will remove having the same code in two different plugins, will make it easier to update in the future and will make it easier for this functionality to be added to other plugins.\r\n * The unit and behat test coverage looks good. There will need to be some minor changes when things are moved to the message api\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMatt P",

Please replace these with \"{{MESSAGE_DEFAULT_ENABLED}}\" instead.\r\n# Do we need to define message providers for each enrol plugin? I think we can move this up (e.g. to core). Then all enrol plugins can simply provide the ability to send enrolment confirmation messages.\r\n# \"{{messagenotificationconfirmation}}\" is quite a vague name. Perhaps something like \"enrol_confirmation\" or \"enrol_confirmation_notification\" would be more appropriate.\r\n# No need for a period at the end of the language string \"Confirmation that message notification has been sent.\" Additionally, it also seems vague. Perhaps something like \"{{Confirmation that the user has been enrolled on a course}}\" would be more suitable?\r\n\r\nh5. Enrol method form\r\n# Perhaps it would be good to use the [hideIf() functionality|https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/subsystems/form#hideif] to hide the custom message text when \"Send course welcome message\" is set to \"No\".\r\n# Please indent the welcome email options in [enrol_cohort|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...marcghaly:master_MDL-4188#diff-9e8d4997e8089f9c76a86eecc813a2a0cd0ab897231522c628e32c5b4bdebcfaR450] and [enrol_manual|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/compare/master...marcghaly:master_MDL-4188#diff-c3c4a244c904b3378a44fa6f0f77a78c641edae229b41add5712912a14098e9fR610].\r\n\r\nh5.

Please also make sure to follow proper [string deprecation|https://moodledev.io/general/projects/api/string-deprecation].\r\n# Perhaps we can improve the default welcome message. \r\n## I think that including the user's name (e.g. first name, last name, full name) in the salutation would be good. Personally, seeing an email containing my name on the salutation like \"Dear Jun, ...\" provides a sense of legitimacy of the message and not being 'spammy', especially if it was sent via email. \r\n## It might also be useful to indicate the role that the user has been enrolled. Something like \"You are now enrolled as a student in Course 1\". It also provides confidence that the user has been enrolled with the correct role in the course.\r\n# Given the above, it would also be good to support placeholders for name and course role should we support these.\r\n# The \"Custom welcome message\" label and its help text are the same for all plugins. I wonder if it's worth moving this to the enrol lang string file instead.\r\n\r\nI'll reopen this for now to give you more time to look into the above points.

We could shorten that text to: \"Accepted formats: plain text or Moodle-auto format.

I have given this tracker an initial review. Please check the following comments:\r\n * enrol/manual/classes/hooks/user_enrolment.php: This namespace of this class is not right to me. Any hooks created for a component should live in classes/hooks/, this is a hook listener. This can live in classes.\r\n * enrol/manual/classes/hooks/user_enrolment.php: 20, The description is not quite correct, it's not a hook, it's the hook listener class for the enrol_manual plugin.\r\n * enrol/manual/classes/hooks/user_enrolment.php: 26, How about a general naming for this? there might be other hook listeners who will be added to this plugin, a better naming would be great, even naming it hook_listener or something similar is all right.\r\n * enrol/manual/classes/hooks/user_enrolment.php: 33, I don't think callback is an appropriate naming, should be a specific one related to the one it's listening to. If more listeners are added, we need a pattern to follow.\r\n * enrol/manual/classes/hooks/user_enrolment.php: How about merging 36 and 41 into one if, their outcome is the same?\r\n * enrol/manual/db/hooks.php: 31, if you are not trying to prioritize it, 0 is not needed.\r\n * enrol/manual/lib.php: 612, why is needed? It's already added in the help icon.\r\n * enrol/self/lib.php: Same comment self enrolment.\r\n * enrol/self/lib.php: 1181, Please add the tracker and tag for final deprecation.\r\n * lib/classes/hook/enrol/user_enrolment.php: I believe this should follow a pattern to allow a better future, I have created the same hook for MDL-78551 and dispatched the hook at the end of the method and named it accordingly. As that tracker is in integration, and this one is on review, will that be easier to add that same hook here?\r\n * lib/classes/hook/enrol/user_enrolment.php: This hook is missing unit test coverage, please feel free to pull the test from MDL-78551 as it's created there already.\r\n * lib/enrollib.php: As per my previous comment, please rename the hook accordingly and dispatch it either at the beginning or at the end, I believe it will have to be at the end.\r\n * lib/enrollib.php: Please use string comparison === in this.\r\n * lib/enrollib.php: How about combining 3635 and 3633 to reduce nesting?\r\n * lib/enrollib.php: 3722-3736, these lines of code seem a little chaotic, they are doing great things but how about simplifying them a little? I believe the below code will simply do the same thing (The check for whether the message contains HTML or not is removed since the format_text function handles both cases efficiently.):\r\n\r\n{code:java}    if ($message && trim($message) !== '') {\r\n        $placeholders = [\r\n            '{$a->coursename}',\r\n            '{$a->profileurl}',\r\n            '{$a->fullname}',\r\n            '{$a->email}',\r\n            '{$a->firstname}',\r\n            '{$a->lastname}',\r\n            '{$a->courserole}',\r\n        ];\r\n        $values = [\r\n            $a->coursename,\r\n            $a->profileurl,\r\n            fullname($user),\r\n            $user->email,\r\n            $user->firstname,\r\n            $user->lastname,\r\n            $courserole,\r\n        ];\r\n        $message = str_replace($placeholders, $values, $message);\r\n    } else {\r\n        $message = get_string('welcometocoursetext', '', $a);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    $messagehtml = format_text($message, FORMAT_MOODLE, ['context' => $context, 'para' => false, 'newlines' => true, 'filter' => true]);\r\n    $messagetext = html_to_text($messagehtml); {code}\r\n \r\n * Should the deprecated method info added in upgrade.txt in enrol_self plugin?\r\n * Unit tests are failing, please give it a look.\r\n * Should there be any unit test for enrol manual itself to test the welcome message?\r\n * I don't think testing the hook display is necessary. If it didn't add the hook, the tests will fail anyways.\r\n\r\nOverall the patch is doing some really good stuffs, great work!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCheers!",

It's already added in the help icon -> The help icon will use the language string with *_help* suffix (It's sendcoursewelcomemessage_help). This is one is sendcoursewelcomemessage, and used for the label.\r\n * lib/classes/hook/enrol/user_enrolment.php -> Yeah, I cherry-picked it from MDL-78551. And mark this one as blocked by MDL-78551.\r\n * lib/enrollib.php: Please use string comparison === in this -> They are the old code, I just moved it to a new place, just want to reduce the changes as minimal as I can. But yes, I changed it.\r\n * Should the deprecated method info added in upgrade.txt in enrol_self plugin? -> Yep, added.\r\n * Unit tests are failing, please give it a look -> It's a random failure of GHA, please see the correct PHPUnit in the previous comment.\r\n * Should there be any unit test for enrol manual itself to test the welcome message? -> Yep, added.\r\n\r\nAll the changes are in fix-up commits, could you please take a look again?\r\n\r\nThanks,",

      "27/Mar/24 11:49 PM;5c01277d9bb006551dcaab41;Hi [~accountid:712020:4fbbf1ec-4bff-48ce-8dd8-9c9535d0c1c3]!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for working on this issue :) I started looking at the patch and I'm sharing with you my findings:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA. If you look at the GHA, there are some PHPUnit failures with MySQL (I've been able to reproduce them locally). They are passing with PostgreSQL and MSSQL (but once you fix them, it would be great to confirm they are passing with all the database engines).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nB. The enrol_self_plugin::get_welcome_email_contact() has been deprecated. I would suggest:\r\n - Creating an issue for the final deprecation and adding it to the epic to remember to remove it (MDL-79719). It would be great to add a @todo comment with the issue number too.\r\n - Move the deprecated method to enrol/self/deprecatedlib.php. Remember to add `require_once(_{_}DIR{_}_ . '/deprecatedlib.php');` to enrol/self/lib.php.\r\n - Use the \\core\\deprecation\\deprecated attribute and the \\core\\deprecation::emit_deprecation_if_present(), introduced recently: [https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation#step-1-immediate-action]\r\n - I think the debugging message in get_welcome_email_contact() should mention get_welcome_message_contact() instead of send_course_welcome_message_to_user().\r\n\r\nC. The PHPDoc for the @return type of get_welcome_message_contact() seems wrong. I was expecting null|stdClass.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nD. The new public method enrol_self_plugin::send_course_welcome_message_to_user should be covered by PHPUnit tests too.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI haven't had a chance to thoroughly examine the code yet. I'll resume reviewing it once you've addressed the earlier points.\r\n\r\nBTW, I was wondering why the hook was only implemented for the manual enrolment and then read your comment about it: \"If we need this feature for other enrolment methods, we can easily implement the hook callback and do it.\"\r\n ",

I've looked at the whole patch and, apart from checking the previous points, I've found a few more that it would be great to have:\r\n\r\n \r\n{quote}(/) A. This one is interesting, it's not specific to MySQL. It's because of PHP 8.1. I was wondering why it's failing because I did not change anything related to that. Sadly, it's failing with the stables without my patch too. So it's not related. I'm still bisecting to find out the reason. Please refer to this build on main without the patch: [https://ci.moodle.org/job/DEV.02%20-%20Developer-requested%20PHPUnit/14953/]\r\n{quote}\r\nWell spotted!! I've prepared a patch for MDL-81386 because once this issue lands, jobs with PHP 8.1 will start failing too looking at GHA (and also checking [this PHPUnit job that I executed manually using PHP8.1|https://ci.moodle.org/view/Testing/job/DEV.02%20-%20Developer-requested%20PHPUnit/14998/]).\r\n{quote}(/) B.\r\nYes, I added @todo for it.\r\nMove the deprecated method to enrol/self/deprecatedlib.php. Remember to add `require_once({}DIR{} . '/deprecatedlib.php');` to enrol/self/lib.php: Have I missed something? get_welcome_email_contact() is a method of class, not a standalone method, so we don't move it to deprecatedlib.php. Could you please check again?\r\nUse the \\core\\deprecation\\deprecated attribute and the \\core\\deprecation::emit_deprecation_if_present(): Yes, I added it.\r\nNice catch, I fixed it.\r\n{quote}\r\nYou're right. I was wrong about moving the method to deprecatedlib.php (as it was in enrol/self/lib.php I didn't check/realise it was inside a class). Sorry for the confusion :)\r\nThanks for updating the rest of the points raised in a fixup commit <3\r\nHowever, the content for the \\core\\deprecation\\deprecated attribute is not expected. The first parameter is the replacement method (so 'enrol_plugin::get_welcome_message_contact' instead of 'enrol_self_plugin::get_welcome_email_contact()' (removing parenthesis too)) and in 'mdl' I would suggest having this issue number (MDL-4188), which is where the deprecation has started. Could you please fix it?\r\n{code}    #[\\core\\attribute\\deprecated('enrol_plugin::get_welcome_message_contact', since: '4.4', mdl: 'MDL-4188')]\r\n{code}\r\n{quote}(/) C. Yep, I fixed it.\r\n{quote}\r\nThanks for fixing the PHPDoc for the @return type of get_welcome_message_contact().\r\n{quote}(x) D. It already has a PHPUnit here\r\n{quote}\r\nI wrote down the wrong method: enrol_plugin::get_welcome_message_contact() is the one that has been created and is not covered by PHPUnit (unless I'm missing anything).\r\nBesides, the PHPUnit test for send_course_welcome_message_to_user() is only covering the \"good\" scenario. I would suggest adding some extra tests to cover the edge cases (like when the message is empty).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nE. Shouldn't enrol_plugin::get_welcome_message_contact() return null when ENROL_DO_NOT_SEND_EMAIL is given? If this method only supports ENROL_SEND_EMAIL_FROM_* (as described in PHPDoc), I would expect it to return null when an invalid ENROL_SEND_EMAIL_FROM_* is given. These are some of the cases that I would also expect to be covered by the PHPUnit tests :)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nF. The new strings you are using from enrol_plugin, like customwelcomemessage, customwelcomemessage_help or customwelcomemessageplaceholder, should be added to the lang/en/enrol.php file (instead of enrol/self/lang/en/enrol_manual.php), because they should belong to the enrol API, not to any specific plugin. Besides, I would also suggest:\r\n - Deprecating them from enrol_self (to avoid duplicating them), unless their content is different (which I think it's not unless I missed anything).\r\n - Using the [AMOS commands|https://moodledev.io/general/projects/api/amos#amos-script], when possible, to move them from enrol_self to enrol. That way, translations will be kept and it will be easier to maintain them in the future.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nG. As customwelcomemessageplaceholder has been created for being used as the default message, shouldn't it be used when the message is empty instead of using welcometocoursetext? I think using welcometocoursetext in this situation is confusing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nH. Why the enrol_self plugin is not replacing the send_course_welcome_message_to_user() method too? With the pre-existing self::email_welcome_message (which I was expecting to be deprecated too, in favour of the new one), users will only receive an email and their preferences for the \"Welcome message for new course enrolments\" notification will be ignored. If you agree that's something should be done, I'm happy to leave it as a follow-up.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI. Most of the manual tests could be implemented with behat. Is there any reason for not having them?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[NO ACTION REQUIRED!!] J. While reviewing this patch I was surprised with the way the git history was organised. For instance, in the first commit, when enrol_plugin::get_welcome_message_contact() and enrol_plugin::send_course_welcome_message_to_user() methods were added, the lib/upgrade.txt was only updated for one of them (the other was added in a different commit). And something similar happened with the PHPUnit: I was expecting it to be in this same commit. There are also some changes done in the methods added in the first commit that are changed later... Please, keep in mind that if you split the commits, make sure they are easy to follow and read by themselves and don't mix contexts :_(",

It does not send the message.\r\n\r\n*ENROL_DO_NOT_SEND_EMAIL* is used to check if the sender method should be triggered or not.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n*F.*\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, I thought that each enrol plugin could have different language strings so they could be customized. But yes, it makes sense to centralize them in one place.

      "12/Apr/24 3:54 AM;5a1ff37ff34f35510562fdcd;Indeed, hence my question. Perhaps the intention was not to allow teachers to customise the welcome message for manual enrolment (as they can with self enrolment) but only to allow it for admins and managers? Let's wait and see.",

      "30/Jul/24 2:06 AM;6260192760d67c0068d8e670;Hello, \r\nWe can't seem to tell how Moodle determines which course contact the course welcome message will come from. In a real life application our client has multiple \"teachers\" who are all identified as potential course contacts. In testing, Moodle does not send the message from the first \"teacher\" enrolled - it seems to choose at random. \r\nCan someone advise how the course contact is chosen so we can set a workflow that ensures the welcome message is sent from the desired course contact? \r\nThank you, \r\nVanessa",
      "30/Jul/24 2:30 AM;5a1ff37ff34f35510562fdcd;That's very interesting [~accountid:6260192760d67c0068d8e670]   I just tested on my dev site and it did send the message from the first teacher I manually enrolled in the course (in accordance with Site admin > Plugins > Enrolments > Manual enrolments > Send course welcome message.. I wonder if you have found a bug in the behaviour and we need a new tracker issue? Let's await a response.",
      "30/Jul/24 9:11 PM;6260192760d67c0068d8e670;Mary, \r\nThat you for your prompt response! I did additional testing and identified that if you attempt to use a system-level role as the Course contact you experience that Moodle sends the automatic welcome message from the first Course contact - first being who is first in that list alphabetically. \r\nWhat I did to resolve the trouble for my client was to make a duplicate of their system-level role but change it's context to course-level and then set that as the identified Course contact and in that scenario the course welcome message goes out from the first enrolled into the course with that role. \r\nVanessa",
      "31/Jul/24 5:09 PM;712020:0943913e-3880-4a7f-92e5-4325939c88b3;Hello. Been reading this exchange with interest.\r\n\r\nMaybe the \"course contact\" option is indeed insufficient when +1 enrolled users belong to the course contact role (as set on /admin/settings.php?section=coursecontact ) ?\r\n\r\nIf so, then maybe we need an option for changing that alphabetically-first default in the enrolment method settings. The default could be the alphabetically first/only teacher - with the possibility to select another contact person if present in the course. The fall-back could be to revert to the first name from the alphabetical list if the selected teacher leaves the course (or to no-one if no participant with the contact role is available in the course).\r\n\r\nFor now, if that alphabetical rule is indeed in force, then some info should be given in the relevant help sections and docs. I haven't looked...\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nPrzemek",

    "Description": "I believe popups are the wrong way to interact with the user. Popups are unnecessary in any web application and only cause confusion to new users (they can be lost by clicking on the backgrounded windows, etc.).  Please look at Gmail for an example.  Everything can be done in tabs, conversations, etc.  I believe most usability experts will also agree that popups are a pitfall.\n\nIn my own configuration, popups appear in new tabs and replace the current tab.  I purposely use Firefox with the Tab Mix extension to prevent popups and force all new content to be open in new tabs.  When I use Moodle it is very inconvenient because I have to close the extra tab and hit the back button on my current tab to return to my previous work.\n\nI know this would entail a lot of work to implement, but please consider this for future revisions of Moodle.",

      "02/Nov/05 9:19 AM;557058:04670d95-8ea4-4705-9d43-683a4fdf2d81;From Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Tuesday, 1 November 2005, 01:16 AM:\n\nI have this feature fully developed on my home install, but there is an issue we need to address before I can commit it to CVS.\n\n\n\nI 'm using the repeatid column to link events in many courses together (this works very well along linking repeated events together, you can have repeating events in many courses created at the same time). This means that when editing an event, the user may choose to edit ALL linked events at the same time.\n\n\n\nImagine this scenario: a teacher creates an event in all courses he is teaching (A and B). Then, another teacher who only teaches in course A wants to edit or delete that event.\n\n\n\nAllowing the event in course B to be edited at the same time sounds counter-intuitive.\n\n\n\nNOT allowing the event in course B to be edited could be confusing to BOTH teachers, since the events could easily get out of sync.\n\n\n\nDo you have any good ideas about what to do in this case? We could also discuss it in the forums for more feedback...\n\nFrom Samuli Karevaara (samuli.karevaara at lamk.fi) Tuesday, 1 November 2005, 03:45 AM:\n\nThe technical difficulties aside, I would give the course A teacher rights to edit the event just for the course A, similar to this instance only on a series of events.\n\n\n\nIf the A teacher needs to edit a calendar marking for the course B too, (s)he needs rights to the course B too. Otherwise it's incorrectly put to both courses by the first teacher in the first place.\n\n\n\nTo me it would seem that events used by this feature would be personal, that is, relating to that _teacher_ only, not all of his/her courses. Specially as (s)he can't put Lectures at noon to all of his/her courses :-)\n\n\n\nBy out of sync, do you mean technically or socially/logically? If the latter, can you think of an example, as I can't, out of my hat.\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Tuesday, 1 November 2005, 08:02 PM:\n\n> To me it would seem that events used by this feature would be\n\n> personal, that is, relating to that _teacher_ only, not all of\n\n> his/her courses.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately this cannot be done with the existing events infrastructure. If it's a course event, it can be edited by any teacher. If it's a user event, it doesn't show to students. ;-)\n\n\n\n> Specially as (s)he can't put Lectures at noon to all of his/her courses.\n\n\n\nWhy can't (s)he do it? I thought that was the whole point of this feature? I probably don't understand what you mean here.\n\n\n\nI 'm sure there can be a nice solution to this, but my goals (below) are making this a bit difficult...\n\n\n\n1. Don't modify/clutter the user interface much\n\n2. Make it immediately clear to teachers what's going to happen when they add/edit/delete event(s)\n\n3. Make it deliberately DIFFICULT for them to do something that could cause problems (i.e., a teacher editing one event only from a group of events that another teacher created all at once)\n\n\n\nMaybe we should bring in some more people to this conversation.\n\nFrom Samuli Karevaara (samuli.karevaara at lamk.fi) Tuesday, 1 November 2005, 09:35 PM:\n\n>> Specially as (s)he can't put Lectures at noon to all of his/her courses.\n\n> Why can't (s)he do it? I thought that was the whole point of this feature? I probably don't understand what you mean here.\n\n\n\nTechnically yes, but I mean that in the real life it's quite/very rare to have the same teacher teaching different courses in the same place at the same time (which would be what this repeat for all my courses event would be).\n\n\n\nI tried to emphasize that the nature of these events relates to the teacher (I'm away), not to the courses themselves. Different lecture times for different courses would have to be entered as different events as usually.\n\n\n\nGUI-wise I don't think there is a need for clutter, other that one extra option line in the personal event, site event, course event selection. For deletion and editing the GUI would be the same as for repeating events (This event or all of the series?).\n\nFrom Jon Papaioannou (pj at moodle.org) Tuesday, 1 November 2005, 09:56 PM:\n\nThat's EXACTLY where the problem lies. Let's say one teacher says I 'm away in 20 courses. What happens if another teacher edits one instance of this event in just ONE course?\n\n\n\nDo we tell him you can edit 3 instances of this? What about the other 17? What if multiple other teachers choose to edit the original teacher's I 'm away message? This could result in lots of confusion...\n\n\n\nAs for the GUI: I didn't add any new options. I just added a drop-down. Now it says Course event for and the drop-down follows: this course (shortname) / all courses I am teaching / courses other than this follow one per line.\n\n\n\nIf the teacher is teaching only one course, then no drop down is shown at all (just Course event for shortname).\n\n\n\nI was referring mainly to GUI changes that will be needed to make it clear to teachers WHAT they were going to be editing (i.e., which instances of the event).\n\n\n\nAlso, keep in mind that it's possible to create repeating events in multiple courses! (Repeat twice in 3 courses = 6 events). Again, we need to make it clear to people editing the event what exactly they will be editing.\n\nFrom Samuli Karevaara (samuli.karevaara at lamk.fi) Wednesday, 2 November 2005, 01:12 AM:\n\nOne option would be then not to allow other teachers to edit his/her events, like I'm away, the other teacher can't undo that info anyway. The other teacher might, however, add additional info as a new event to his/her course.\n\nFrom Samuli Karevaara (samuli.karevaara at lamk.fi) Wednesday, 2 November 2005, 01:16 AM:\n\nI was also thinking that others editing the repeating course in this case might do it only for the course in question. They can enter their own my courses events if they need something to be repeated across their courses, as those course groups could be an outer-join (not completely overlap) anyway.\n\n\n\nIt might do that you could only repeat an event for the course many times, or once for many courses. Well, there are things like My appointment for students in on Wednesday 12-14 that might be wanted to repeat both weekly and for all the courses.\n\n\n\nAnd what about if the teacher is removed from a course or added to another?\n\n\n\nI see, I see. I do have a saying of my own, that fits here: no new feature is as simple as it seems...\n\nFrom Samuli Karevaara (samuli.karevaara at lamk.fi) Wednesday, 2 November 2005, 01:19 AM:\n\nStill a bit more(sorry for spamming): it seems that the best option for editing, in any case, would be this occurence or every occurense, no mix-matching. Usually this is what is wanted: if My appointment time is changed, then it's everything.",
      "26/Jan/07 9:14 AM;712020:6bdc1247-5df7-446b-8aad-b9708cac0f16;My latest scheme for this would be to implement a personal event for the teacher with an exztra option \"This is a public event\", so this personal teacher event would shown to everybody that is on his/her course. This way it would be more logical that other's can't change the event, even though they share a course where this event is visible.",
      "27/Jan/07 11:53 AM;712020:0edbd55a-daff-410a-8f5e-03f4904679ae;I totally agree with this, plus this event would not be limited to teachers. Any kind of event could be given \"public\" status if, for example, the user has a \"calendar.event.publish\" capability.\n\nBy the way, this became possible after we raised the MySQL requirements to 4.1, since when thinking about this in the past I found no way to do it reasonably fast without adding some tables and doing UNION SELECTs.",

This solution will not allow users to create monthly or annual events.\n\nStep 1 Edit calendar\\event_form.php to include an additional field 'repeatdays' for the number of days between repeats\n\t\t\t\n\t$mform->addElement('text', 'repeatdays', get_string('repeatdays', 'calendar'), 'maxlength=\"10\" size=\"10\"');\n\t$mform->setType('repeatdays', PARAM_INT);\n         $mform->setDefault('repeatdays', 1);\n         $mform->disabledIf('repeatdays','repeat','notchecked');\n\t\t\t\nStep 2 Edit calendar\\lib.php to use number from 'repeatdays' to create repeat events:\n\n$eventcopy->timestart = ($eventcopy->timestart+DAYSECS*$this->properties->repeatdays) + dst_offset_on($eventcopy->timestart) - dst_offset_on($eventcopy->timestart+DAYSECS*$this->properties->repeatdays);\n\n\nStep 3 Edit lang\\en\\calendar.php to include an additional string for the repeatdays field and edit the repeatweeks1 string \n\n$string['repeatdays'] = 'Repeat every how many days?';\n$string['repeatweeksl'] = 'No. of events altogether?'; \n\nAltogether, there are only 7 lines of code added or edited.\n\nTo add a repeating event, calendar users simply check the repeat box, enter the number of days between repeats and then the total number of events to create. \n\nI do not have a patch but will attach the edited files from a Moodle 2.1 instance.",

All works well. \n\nTo add a repeating event, calendar users now check the repeat box, enter the repeat frequency, select the repeat type and then enter the total number of events to create.\n\nI will again attach the edited calendar files from a Moodle 2.1 instance as a zip.\n\nNot arrogant, just hopeful that repeating events can be incorporated into 2.3 as it is such a useful feature and I wouldnt have to edit our own Moodle again after an upgrade.",

However they can choose minutes, hours, fortnights, months or years instead (and any multiple of these).  Have also included a warning if a non existent repeat date is requested such as 31st September or 29th February on a non leap year. Repeating by minutes at first seemed strange but you can use this to book appointments or tutorials every 15 or 20 minutes.\n\nhttps://github.com/kstreckfuss/moodle/commits/master",

This could be a way to incorporate your weekly repeat method. It would also be a good way to provide options for monthly repeats (eg 2nd Friday of the month etc). It shouldn't take that much effort to achieve but it would make the form more complex for users.\n\nPlease have a look at the new version here https://github.com/kstreckfuss/moodle/commits/master ",

I reviewed the one mentioned in the tracker git fields (https://github.com/mackensen/moodle/compare/master...MDL-4283-master).\n\nClearly this is a nice improvement and nice patch, but I found some minor issues which needs to be taken care of.\n# $string['repeat_frequency'] = 'Repeat every <i>x</i> week(s)';\nWe don't recommend using html in strings unless it is extremely necessary. In this case I guess there is really no need for the italics.\n# If I check the \"Repeat\" check box and dont select any day it produces bunch of \"Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$repeat_day\" errors. Ideally if the repeat box is checked the $repeat day should be a required field or else, the day on which the first event is scheduled should be used.\n\nRest looks good.\n\nCheers\nAnkit",

The patch looks good to me (though it's really confusing thinking about datetimes, haha). \r\n\r\nThe only small issue I found was that you should probably add some validation for the \"repeats\" element in the event form to ensure that it only gets set as a positive integer. At the moment you can set it to negative values which gives a weird error to the user.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if you could add a behat test or unit test to cover the changes as well. I had a quick look at the existing tests and unfortunately it doesn't look like there are any that you can simply extend.\r\n\r\nThanks again.",

      "27/Sep/16 10:34 AM;712020:f4aad3ea-cbec-4935-8843-3d55aac0a669;Hi, code basically looks ok, although I think that some things are needed before this is accepted:\r\n\r\n- While not strictly needed I'd not \"reuse\" the 'repeats' element in the form, previously representing the number of repetitions an now representing the repetitions frequency. Instead I'd suggest to rename it to \"repeatfreq\" everywhere.\r\n\r\n- The previous point will help to detect places where the old \"repeats\" is being used, with main place being the {{create_calendar_events()}} external function that with this change is completely broken. We need to support the new repeating stuff there. Not sure if via adding new params or creating new function and deprecating existing one, but for sure the external function should continue working. Pinging [~accountid:70121:2e213123-2f2b-4f81-9d72-666f52efbf26] about opinions related to handling the new repeating properties and keeping the old working (y/n).\r\n\r\n- Also, as Dan commented, phpunit tests are broken, surely the previous points will help to solve that.\r\n\r\n- Offtopic thought: It's a pity that the exiting {{calendar/classes/rrule_manager.php}} cannot be reused for generating those repeating events supporting virtually everything in ical events (we cannot use it because it does not use proper date intervals supporting TZs/DSTs but fixed seconds intervals.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's clear this needs a little bit more of work... so reopening... ciao :-)r",

    "Description": "I have been using the quiz module extensively for posting multiple choice/true false assignments. This is working great except for when I have students who, for whatever reason, don't complete the quiz by the close date. As part of my courses I allow late turn-in for the first few days after an assignment is due with a penalty. Currently there doesn't seem to be a convenient way to do this with the quiz module--I have to manually go in and change the close date so that the student(s) who did not complete the quiz can get in.\r\n\r\nMaybe if there were a due date and then an optionally different close date on the setup page for a quiz? The due date could work exactly like the close date now (show this date on the calendar, events, etc.) but the quiz would not actually become unavailable until the close date. And, since I'm dreaming pie-in-the-sky here, maybe an option to apply daily penalties past the due date (like 10% per day past the due date).\r\n\r\nForum discussion: \"[Plugins to penalize students' grade for late submission|https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=328970]\" ",

      "14/Sep/09 3:01 PM;712020:0e67bb80-0fa7-442e-ab56-f67cb9ebc9a3;I have been using the patch listed here because it is absolutely essential to retention efforts in my classes which include many underprepared or disadvantaged students.  If the first quiz deadline in a class was absolute, many students would miss the deadline and then drop the class.  If I extend any deadline, students will expect all deadlines to be extended and will not perform.\n\nUsing the quiz submit late patch has worked well to maintain student retention but there are glitches including resetting of the clock in multi-page quizzes' whenever the student clicks from one page to the next.  I am very disappointed to see that the current demo versions of 2.0 do NOT address this issue at all.  Student retention may not be an issue for many colleges but it certainly is for many of us.  Since Sakai/Etudes has had functionality to deal with this issue AND to allow students to have extra time on tests (those who may have learning disabilities) for at least 2-3 years now, this issue should be relatively easy to address and VERY HIGH on the REQUIRED features list.  It appears that Sakai/Etudes are much more responsive to the entire range of student needs, especially the \"low\" end than the Moodle development community is - exactly the opposite of what I believe is intended.\n\nIf nothing else, the simplest fix would be to allow the instructor to edit the closing date that appears to students through the quizzes link page display.  We can put a \"fake\" last day to submit date in the text of the quiz information but that is subverted because the real close date appears to students who just click on the quizzes link.\n\nIs it possible, at least as an interim fix to simply allow instructor override of the information appearing under the \"Quiz closes\" column on the quizzes display page - preferably for 1.9.3 but definitely when 2.0 hits the streets..\n",

This probably needs ot be considered in combination with MDL-3030, which is the other side of the coin.\n\nAnd I cannot promise when anything will be done about this, I have plenty of other problems (with lots of votes) that need to be fixed first.",
      "17/Sep/09 8:58 AM;712020:0e67bb80-0fa7-442e-ab56-f67cb9ebc9a3;Actually there is an easy fix for the main issue of late submissions being allowed.  It is exactly almost exactly the way this was done in Sakai/eytudes 3 years ago.  here are the basic steps.\n\n1) Set up new variable \"timedue\" (to add to the existing \"timeopen\" and \"timeclose\" quiz variables.\n2) Add a new date selection box exactly like the two existing boxes in modedit.php (quiz settings edit page) to set the value of this variable and label \"Quiz due time\"\n3) Add a selection box immediately below the above with two options\n        \"Show quiz due date\" and\n        \"Show quiz close date\"\n4) Set up mod/quiz/index.php  so that if \"Show quiz date\" is selected the new variable timedue fills the dates columns.  If \"Show quiz  close date\" is selected fill this column with timeclose data\n\nIf done this way, absolutely NOTHING changes with regard to how the quiz close date functionality issues are addressed and NO other changes are needed until there is time to do things like add aotumatic penalties for late submission and, my biggest wish after the quizdue fix, the ability to easily set quiz time limits for specific students.\n\nI do not program in php but I am pretty sure that, if I lknew the existing Moodle structure well (I do not - I only started using it this year) and if it were in a language I do program in (Java, cgi, etc), it would take only a few hours at most to write, and fully test this fix.

I believe many instructors would use such a feature once they found what it can do to improve student retention - a huge issue in colleges in many nations and certainly in most 2 year colleges in the United States.  Why do I believe it affects a lot of Moodle users?  It is not just a gut feeling or my won needs.  My information comes from being in the Sakai/Etudes development community and having observed how extensive the use of this feature became and how much push for more functionaily came from large numbers of users once the late submission technique was first introduced there.\n\nYou are right that I could probably program this fix myself.  I expect it would only take a few hours of my time.  However, to do so, I would need to set up an entirely new and unique Moodle (which I may indeed do even though I do not currently have the appropriate server testing environment).  My existing implementation, although it is self-administered and used only for my own clases, is an active site with 200-300 students working on the site each day - 24 hours a day - 7 days a week - and  I can not take that offline until next summer when there will be a couple of weeks break for me to work in.\n\nIf I do develop a fix I will, of course, post it here but it will unfortuntely only be manual patching information not a patch file.",

This would satisfy  the immediate need for me (although the other aspects of the issue - including different time limits for different students highly desirable).\n\nThe only thing I can see as a difficulty in this immediate fix is the display of the quiz close date in the calendar function.  Of course, one could simply set the quiz close date to 2012 and it would be out of the way and probably unseen but it would be better if it could be simply switched off in calendar and replaced by the timedue date.   Event open and close dates are reported to be automatically shown in calendar but I can not find which file has the code that does this.  If anyone knows where this code is I would appreciate you sending me that info.  If I have that, I can at least investigate whether I can easily make the timedue modification operate better by having the calendar show the timedue date if it exists and the timeclose date if no timedue exists.\n",

I would be interested to see what people think of this solution, and other people may wish to use your modifications. Thanks.",

I do this for two reasons:\n1. as teachers of adult distance learners we have students who have a lot of good reasons to not be able to sit assessments on time and we like to be able to make allowances for them doing them late.\n\n2. I want my students to be able to retake the quiz as many times as they like for the purposes of study. They are scored on their first attempt, but I want them to have free access after that so they can explore all the feedback even for options they did not choose the first time around (which is all you see when you review your attempt).\n\nI could also achieve the above by not putting in a closing date, but then I would lose the functionality of the quiz calendar entries, and the quiz itself would not show due dates.

The objections that the developers seem to have are that it requires an additional field in the database and another entry box on the \"already crowded\" quiz settings page.  I personally think these objections are bogus.  The page is far from crowded with the new box added and most instructors I know would certainly tolerate a little more \"clutter\" to obtain an important functionality.  The argument about not adding another database field is also very puzzling to me.  It took me about 3 minutes to do that even though I have zero formal programming education or experience.    Also,  what does one more data field matter in a database that has many hundreds of data fields already?  I have actually added several more data fields to various tables for my specific needs and it certainly does not in any way adversely affect performance.  .  The patch I developed could easily have been incorporated in 2.0 with about 1-2 hours work at most.  In fact, I am planning to do that soon since I will probably upgrade to 2.0 next summer.  When I do, I will post a new patch here.    This deadline date patch has now been working successfully for me for 2 semesters and I simply will not teach with any courseware that does not have this functionality or to which I can not add it easily.

The major point is that to implement this as far as I got is easy and it solves the biggest problem for many (granted not all) instructors.  Automatically generated penalties would be highly desireable for many people but penalties can be assesed manually (as I now do) and quizzes would not have to be reopened for one or two students who might have very good reasons for being late.  This is the way I use the patch now - students can take quizzes late and only get penalized if they have not expressed a good reason for being late e.g. yesterday I had one student who was hospitalized and who will not be penalized for being late.\n\nI know my patch was not perfect but it does work even for multi page quizzes (which I use all the time) and simply cleaning the patch up and implementing it would be a major enhancement that users could have available now.\n\n",

To get an item in the calendar it must have a close date.\n\nI teach 8 classes and I have structured Moodle to handle all of my assignments. However, it is very time consuming to open activities for those students who have legitimately or illegitimately missed a date.\n\nMy preferred functionality would be to set a start date, a due date, and then a series of penalty dates, or a penalty rule, then a close date.\n\nI might make an assignment work something like this:\n\nStart date: first day of class\nDue date: date material is discussed in class\nAfter x time: deduct x%\nAfter y time: deduct y%\nEtc.\nClose Date: end of class\n\nThis puts all of the accountability for the assignment in the hands of the student, they may earn what ever grade they would like, with deadline being a factor.\n\nTo me this mirrors the real life I am trying to prepare them for. In real life, getting tasks ahead of time has extra value, getting it done on time has value, getting it done just a bit late has most of the value, the later it gets, the less value it has until it has no value (or even negative value)\n\nThe last comment on this was over a year ago, is there any work being done on this now? I have worked with several open source projects and recognize the community driven nature of priorities and I appreciate all of your hard work.

Here's the scenario.  When editing a quiz, the last item could be something like: \"Penalty\" \"Percent\" for \"x Days Late\".  The \"Penalty\" could be a number.  \"Percent\" could be changeable from \"Percent\" to \"Points\", and then \"Days Late\" is a number.  Below this could be a \"More\" button, that would allow the designer to add additional penalty logic, just as the multiple-choice question in Moodle provides the ability to add \"more\" multiple choice answers.\n\nWow, I know this could be some difficult programming, but it could provide benefits to many.

Simply assign all students in the class to a Group,  Set the deadline date for the group by using group overrides for each quiz you want to allow late submissions.  I have generally used the last day of semester and then used phpmyadmin to delete all group events from the mdl-event table in the database.  This plus the additional tweaks below will prevent students from seeing the close date for the group.  If you do not have database access (you could simply set the date to a year or two ahead and achive much the same).  Next step is to edit some of the text labels in moodle/mod/quiz/lang/en/quiz.php file to prevent display of the Group close date  to the student as follows\r\n\r\n$string['quizcloses'] = 'QUIZ DEADLINE';\r\n$string['quizcloseson'] = 'Quiz deadlines are listed in the Moodle Calendar and on the Quizzes page accessed through links in the left navigation bar of your main Moodle page.<br />Late submissions may incur penalties. This quiz closes and no more late attempts are allowed after Noon on the Friday of the last week of semester';\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the student sees only the main quiz close dates on the Quizzes page and in the Calendar and they are labelled DEADLINES.  Students do not see the group close dates.  However, they are instructed that all quizzes can be taken after their deadline and they are aware that late penalties may apply.  I also instruct the students that late penalties will only be applied at the end of semester, that even the largest late penalty that can be incurred amounts to only about 5-8% of their total grade, and that late penalties will be waived unless they are cronically late during the semester.   \r\n\r\nThis has worked well for me for a number of semesters.  For those who have not experienced it, in many colleges students will simply drop out of a class if they miss a couple of quiz deadlines for some reason in their busy lives. The absolute \"quiz closed\" message they get from Moodle discourages most of them from even asking the instructor, especially in a fully online class, for a late submission extension, so the current capability of overriding a quiz close date per student, although adequate IF a student asks for an extension is just not enough. Using the above procedure my classes average drop out rate fell from about 50% to less than 20%.  It would be a huge service to instructors and students if a late quiz with automatic late penalties that could be waved by an override in gradebook were a standard feature that all Moodle users, not just those of us who run our own Moodle installation could use.",
      "07/Sep/15 9:51 AM;712020:5c12bbd5-33f1-4b98-a58f-8a9c4a9dcbf9;I too would like to have a late penalty feature in Moodle quizzes. Late penalties are a good way to help students keep up with the pace of the course and are used in universities around the world.\r\n\r\nHere is my workaround which I will explain with an example. Bear in mind that this is only a workaround until a late penalty feature is implemented in Moodle.\r\n\r\nAlthough my workaround is somewhat laborious to set up, the result is simple to use by the students. The method uses only standard features of Moodle and does not require any manager permission. Also, it can be modified easily as required.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that “quiz.MQ” is due on September 10th, 5:00 pm (where MQ stands for Moodle quiz). Late penalties are as follows:\r\n\r\n   • on time = no penalty\r\n   • late within 48 h = 10 % off\r\n   • late within 7 days = 30 % off\r\n   • late more than 7 days = 50 % off\r\n\r\nThese penalties define four time periods, for which four late penalty quizzes are defined: quiz.LP0, quiz.LP1, quiz.LP2 and quiz.LP3 (where LP stands for “late penalty”). These quizzes are placed conveniently below quiz.MQ on the Moodle page. Depending on the lateness, the corresponding late penalty quiz will appear when quiz.MQ is completed.\r\n\r\nThe late penalty quizzes consists of one “Short answer” question asking for the student’s initials, with the wildcard “*” as the correct answer. Hence, any answer is correct and it is simple to get one of the following marks depending on lateness:\r\n\r\n   • full mark for quiz.LP0:   100 points (= 100 – 0 penalty) \r\n   • full mark for quiz.LP1:   90 points (= 100 – 10 % penalty) \r\n   • full mark for quiz.LP2:   70 points (= 100 – 30 % penalty) \r\n   • full mark for quiz.LP3:   50 points (= 100 – 50 % penalty)\r\n\r\nIn the gradebook, define quiz.WLP as a grade item. This is the grade for quiz.MQ with the late penalty taken into account (WLP stands for \"with late penalty taken into account\"). In “Categories and items” of “Grade administration”, define the formula for quiz.WLP as:\r\n\r\n=[[quiz.MQ]]*max([[quiz.LP0]];[[quiz.LP1]];[[quiz.LP2]];[[quiz.LP3]])/100\r\n\r\nwhere quiz.MQ, quiz.LP0, quiz.LP1, quiz.LP2 and quiz.LP3 are ID numbers.\r\n\r\nAdd the following restrictions under “Restricting access” in quiz.LP0 to .LP3. Hide all the conditions (cross the eye) :\r\n\r\n   • quiz.LP0\r\n     The student must satisfy all the following conditions:\r\n        o Date: until 10th September, 17:00\r\n        o Grade: quiz.MQ leaving % blank\r\n        o Grade: quiz.WLP < 1 %\r\n\r\n   • quiz.LP1\r\n     The student must satisfy all the following conditions:\r\n        o Date: from 10th September, 17:00\r\n        o Date: until 12th September, 17:00\r\n        o Grade: quiz.MQ leaving % blank\r\n        o Grade: quiz.WLP < 1 %\r\n\r\n   • quiz.LP2\r\n     The student must satisfy all the following conditions:\r\n        o Date: from 12th September, 17:00\r\n        o Date: until 17th September, 17:00\r\n        o Grade: quiz.MQ leaving % blank\r\n        o Grade: quiz.WLP < 1 %\r\n\r\n   • quiz.LP3\r\n     The student must satisfy all the following conditions:\r\n        o Date: from 17th September, 17:00\r\n        o Grade: quiz.MQ leaving % blank\r\n        o Grade: quiz_1.WLP < 1 %\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n\r\n• “quiz.MQ leaving % blank” insures that the proper quiz.LP0 to .LP3 will appear only when quiz.MQ has been completed.\r\n\r\n• “quiz.WLP < 1 %” means that quiz.WLP is still 0 % where it is assumed that students cannot get a mark < 1% for a completed quiz.MQ. This will display quiz.LP0, quiz.LP1, quiz.LP2 or quiz.LP3 as long as it is not completed and will hide it once it is completed (with a brief message saying that it is no longer available).\r\n\r\nGive the same label to quiz.LP0, quiz.LP1, quiz.LP2 and quiz.LP3 such as “Please confirm with your initials” and give corresponding feedbacks such as “You have submitted on time”, “A late penalty of 10 % will be applied”, “A late penalty of 30 % will be applied” and “A late penalty of 50 % will be applied”.\r\n\r\nIf a student is late but has a valid justification and should not penalized, his mark for quiz.LP1, .LP2, or .LP3 can easily be changed to 100 in the gradebook in order to cancel the penalty.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up the workaround, be careful to define Grade items before defining restrictions referring to them. Also, Gradebook formulas containing undefined ID numbers will almost crash the gradebook but it can be corrected and nothing gets lost.\r\n\r\nThe workaround can easily be extended to the case where the same deadline and late penalties apply to a series of quizzes. It is slightly more complicated to set up, but works fine.\r\n\r\nI have tried this workaround with my students and so far it works quite well.\r\n\r\nRegards.",

      "16/Dec/20 1:26 AM;712020:ce48121a-6a0e-4e2d-927e-52f1170d8d93;Thanks Dominique for posting the work around.  I've modified it slightly and thought I'd share (sorry this is my first ever post so please let me know if I've committed a faux pas).\r\n\r\nI have the original assignment (quiz.MQ0), copies of the original assignment (quiz.MQ1, quiz.MQ2), and an extension request \"assignment\" (quiz.extension).  I would like to penalize 10% per week extension (can be easily adjusted to different values).\r\n\r\n+Extension \"assignment\"+\r\n\r\nThe quiz.extension assignment contains one multiple choice question, where the possible responses are the various requested extension times, e.g.\r\n\r\na) One week extension (\"correct\" - 100%)\r\n\r\nb) Two week extension (\"partial credit\" - 90%)\r\n\r\nI then set quiz.extension to have a total point value of 100, thus if a student requests a two week extension, quiz.extension will return a score of 90; I'll use the score of quiz.extension to be the penalty for the extension.\r\n\r\n+Restriction setting:+\r\n * quiz.MQ0 has a *grade* restriction that student +must not+ have a grade for quiz.extension.  This ensures that the original assignment is hidden if an extension is requested to avoid the student attempting to complete the \"wrong\" assignment.\r\n * quiz.extension has a *date* restriction that it will be visible after the quiz.MQ due date has passed.  This ensures that an extension cannot inadvertently be requested prior to the original assignment closing.\r\n * quiz.MQ1 has a *grade* restriction of quiz.extension must be >= 90% and a close date of the original due date + 1 week.\r\n * quiz.MQ2 has a *grade* restriction of quiz.extension must be >=80% and <90% and a close date of the original due date + 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe last two restrictions ensure that only one extension assignment is visible.  Also helpful is that the close date can be modified using the Reports > Dates whereas the *date* restriction has to be modified by going into each assignment.  The former approach is my preference as I often run behind in lecture and therefore need to change due dates.\r\n\r\n+Gradebook setting+\r\n\r\nIn the gradebook, I then created a new grade item (quiz.WLP).  I then used applied the calculation to the grade item:\r\n\r\n=if([[quiz.extension]], max([[quiz.MQ1]],[[quiz.MQ2]])*([[quiz.extension]]-10)/100, [[quiz.MQ0]])\r\n\r\nWalking through:\r\n # The if statement checks if there is a score for [[quiz.extension]]; if not, then the score for quiz.MQ0 is assigned without any additional adjustments.\r\n # If there is a score for [[quiz.extension]], then the score for quiz.MQ1 or quiz.MQ2 will be taken, the other quiz having an empty value due to the quiz restrictions.\r\n # The factor ([[quiz.extension]]-10)/100 sets the late penalty; the \"10\" needs to be subtracted as a multiple choice question in a quiz assignment requires at least one answer to be marked as 100%.\r\n\r\n-Cheers.  Greg R.\r\n\r\n ",

I suggested that we needed a plugin that automatically applies late penalties (which are standardised within the institution), taking into account extensions and overwriting the marked grade (after copying the original \"if this was on time\" grade as a comment line into the feedback) for all assessment activities. It would also sit alongside automatic extensions for students with additional support needs based on an invisible flag added to their profile (I proposed a model for this several years ago and someone built a version but they never submitted it to Moodle as a plugin). Automating features like these is a no-brainer, as every institution must have a similar policy on late work and extra time, and it takes up a huge amount of staff time to administer manually, with risks of uneven application across the student body.",

    "Description": "It seems that, currently, if you categorize an assignment/quiz before it is due the gradebook reflects a reduced grade in that category because the assignment has no grade. One can get around this by leaving the assignment/quiz uncategorised (with uncategorised items hidden in the gradebook) and then assign it a category only after the due date passes (and the student should have a grade). This causes the overall student grade and category grade to be accurate both before and after the due date.\n\n\n\nCouldn't this process be automated? Possibly by adding the category selection drop-down list to the assignment/quiz/etc. creation page along with a check box that says something like Leave uncategorised until due date is passed?",

      "05/Jan/15 5:50 PM;557058:ad4396bc-c0c2-4271-b0a9-df80010113dc;I think we may want to consider this issue. Here is the usage scenario that I am thinking about, it is time for progress reports and the teacher wants to make sure that all submitted work has been graded. Rather than having to open up each assignment and check http://localhost/m28/mod/assign/view.php?id=2 it would be good if the teacher could open up the course index summary http://localhost/m28/mod/assign/index.php?id=2 and look and see if there are any submission on any of the assignments that needs to be graded. This gives the teacher a single location rather than multiple ones. \r\n\r\nFrom a consistency perspective we show the number of submissions that need to be graded in view.php and index.php shows similar information so adding the column to index.php increases that consistency (at least in my mind).\r\n\r\nI have created a quick patch (please review the logic to ensure that it gracefully handles various scenarios - teacher has done no grading, students have made no submissions, etc.). The intended behavior is for a teacher with the capability to grade assignments, it will show the number of assignments that need to be graded. For a student, a user with the ability to submit an assignment it will show whether the submission has been modified after the grade date. If it has then it may need to be re-graded so it will show Yes; otherwise, the most recent submission has been graded and it will show no. \r\n\r\nPeace - Anthony ",

I think having a set of two radio buttons, a) variable width under control of browser, b) preset width in percent or in pixels. The latter followed by an input field.\n\n\n\nAnother option could control centering. A simple checkbox should do.",

    "Description": "Using 1.5.2+, a short answer quiz question shows previous answers as they begin to be typed, a result of the form history being saved on the local computer.  I have more students in my class than I have computers (doh!) and students have to take quizzes in class in two shifts.  The second student simply has to start typing the right answer (or even just try each letter on the keyboard to find the right one) and is then presented with the correct answer (or possibly incorrect answer) from the previous student's attempt on the same computer.  My classroom uses Macs and both Safari and Firefox have the same issue. Private Browsing in Safari does keep responses from being saved, but a) it has to be turned on each time Safari is opened, and b) once the damage is done by forgetting to turn on Private Browsing once, the entry is now saved for all future attempts, except for digging in the User Library to find and remove the AutoFill history.  It would be nice if the secure window would treat short answer questions like a password entry and not save the response for future attempts rather than relying on Private Browsing or similar features of a browser.",

This is the reason to display all that info...\n\n\n\nSo, I'm not sure if we can short it without risks...and I think it won't be done until an alternative solution was discovered.\n\nFrom Timothy Takemoto (timothy at nihonbunka.com) Tuesday, 6 December 2005, 06:37 PM:\n\nI see.\n\n\n\nSo, how about just on the first page? It is pretty cosmetic, and I have done it for myself, but I would recommend it. \n\n\n\nBackup is the way that course materials are moved between courses still so this is not just a backroom admin function. It is something that users are using all the time. \n\n\n\nBut this is minor!\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n\nTim",

At the moment I am thinking the work around is as follows (but I have not tried it yet). \n\n\n\nWORKAROUND: Try appending a restored template_course onto the end of the one I am editing - the idea being the backup template_course contains examples of all the activities I use scripted as I use them. Then use the move_to_any_position icon to place new activitiy(ies) where I want it (them), and make any minor editing changes necessary.\n\n\n\nI guess this won't happen overnight although I think it would be hugely attractive for all.  \n\n\n\nThere may also be a better workaround I haven't thought of yet...? \n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nJoc",

    "Description": "In grading module, I found the Curve To option useless.\n\nSometimes, I need to correct the maximum grade for activity(s) (for example, to reach a desirable total sum) AFTER that activity(s) had been taken by students. For a quiz, I must regrade attempts, but even worse, I must manually alter every student grade for an assignment! Is it not the Curve to option designed for??\n\nSuprisinly, it don't work this way. When I, say, provide 19 in Curve To box (wanting to reduce the maximum grade for an assignment from 20 to 19), the points don't change but the percents do. For example, a student having highest 20 points still have 20 points (not 19) but 110%. How can it be adopted to real life?..\n\nThe option, in my vision, should scale the points also, or at least provide both functionality. Thank you in advance.",

A 100 point assignment scaled to 90 points gives a student with 90 points 100%. If a student has 100 points, they have 110% of the total available. This works when curves are set at or above the highest grade given, which seems the general case.",

      "01/Jun/08 7:25 AM;712020:eed5dc5a-21ca-43bf-ac0a-0519d4291ed4;As part of the MDL-11752 work, we decoupled the uploading of the profile images, and the processing of those image files. As a result, we can now get the profile images from anywhere (from an external URL, an LDAP directory, etc.), put them in a temporary file in moodledata and use the following code to assign the picture to the user. $id is the user id, and $originalfile is the path to the (temporary) profile image file\n\n   $destination = create_profile_image_destination($id, 'user');\n    if ($destination === false) {\n        // do whatever you need to handle the error.\n    }\n\n    $success = process_profile_image($originalfile, $destination);\n\nSo I'd say we can close this bug as fixed. Dan?\n\nSaludos. Iñaki.",
